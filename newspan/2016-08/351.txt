Times Insider shares historical insights from The New York Times. In this piece, David W. Dunlap, a Metro reporter, looks back at The Times’s inaugural Book Review.
The first edition of the Book Review.
“We are the last daily newspaper in America with a free-standing books section, an essential journal of literary discussion and debate,” Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, told the organization’s staff in an email on Wednesday announcing that daily and Sunday books coverage would be united under the editorship of Pamela Paul.
As the publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., did on Friday, Mr. Baquet assured his colleagues — and, by extension, Times readers — that there were no plans to stop printing the Sunday Book Review.
We can assume Mr. Sulzberger’s great-grandfather, Adolph S. Ochs, would be pleased to know that.
The Saturday Book Review Supplement was one of Mr. Ochs’s first innovations when he took over The Times as publisher. The four-column, tabloid-size insert began its run on Oct. 10, 1896, with Francis Whiting Halsey as the editor.
In 1911, the review was moved to Sundays, on the theory that it would be more appreciatively received by readers with a bit of time on their hands.
Publishers’ fall lists filled much of Page 5. Elsewhere were dozens of tweet-length literary tidbits. Articles included “Oscar Wilde’s Forlorn State,” a description of his demoralizing and dehumanizing imprisonment that had been lifted straight from The Bookman magazine. Aggregation is nothing new.
An essay, “Novelists’ Stock Phrases,” deplored the use of repetitious clichés in place of original ideas. It took the form of an imaginary conversation between two figures called Smith and Little Dobbs.
It was called the department store.
