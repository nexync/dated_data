But Ms. Angwin greatly understates the significance of the recent European privacy law. That law prohibits automated decision-making that results in discrimination and requires that companies provide information about how decisions are made. That provision has its roots in a 1995 law that required access to the “logic” of the processing.
That is the right approach. We should require “algorithmic transparency” and make open and accountable computer-based decisions. The Electronic Privacy Information Center has launched a national campaign to pursue this goal. Among our objectives: Open the Code, Stop Discrimination by Computer, and End Secret Profiling.
Algorithmic accountability is a complex topic, but the impact cuts broadly across life in America, from jobs and credit to housing and criminal justice.
