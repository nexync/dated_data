Some Britons love ringing church bells so much that they think it ought to be an Olympic sport.
There are about 5,000 churches with bell ringers in Britain, and almost everyone lives within hearing range of one of them. Bell-ringing enthusiasts are called campanologists, and the country has about 40,000 of them.
Not everyone embraces bell ringing: The sessions, or peals, that may be music to some people’s ears drive others insane. In 2011, a man living in Sharow, North Yorkshire, was so incensed by a three-hour peal that he locked the bell ringers inside the church belfry.
Ringing is a strenuous business, and a lengthy peal can feel like running a marathon, according to Kate Flavell, who works for the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers.
British church bells have been ringing since medieval times, when the sound was thought to drive away the devil and calm storms. After the Reformation, churches started hanging their bells on wheels, giving better timing control; that allowed the development of intricately patterned “change ringing” instead of the more random chiming of most church bells in Continental Europe.
Bell ringing became fashionable in the 1600s, and soon, teams of ringers were holding competitions. But those events were often connected with large meals at the local pub that could get boisterous, with bell ringers described as being lazy and drunk, according to a website on the history of bell ringing.
