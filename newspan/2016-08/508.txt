If you’re not already in the bag for its subject, then “Richard Linklater: Dream Is Destiny” wants to give your arm an extra twist. Maybe its makers, Louis Black and Karen Bernstein, found neither of the two film profiles from 2014 sufficiently enthusiastic about Mr. Linklater’s resolutely outsider talents; whatever the case, they’ve decided to dive deeper into the kudos and the mind that inspired them.
It’s shamelessly partial but also warmly pleasurable, partly because Mr. Linklater is an engaging and humble conversationalist who moves easily to the beat of his own soundtrack. The Seinfeld of American independent cinema — or, to quote the producer Jonathan Sehring, someone who understands “the drama of no drama” — he favors attitude over plot and mood over action.
That could be why some of his most purely entertaining films, like his 2003 comedy, “School of Rock,” and the sad-sweet “Me and Orson Welles” (2009), were also written by others. But this and other prickly questions about his work are notably absent here, as Ms. Bernstein and Mr. Black (co-founder and editor of The Austin Chronicle and a longtime friend of Mr. Linklater’s) embark on a cozily chronological ramble through career highlights and personal reminiscences. This blinkered view allows the commercial failure of “Dazed and Confused” (1993) to be attributed to a lack of studio support rather than, say, to its ultraspecific snapshot of 1970s American experience, likely to appeal primarily to those who came of age around the same time as its director.
Yet the man who, for better or worse, inspired Kevin Smith to make movies might also be the most cleareyed about his own limitations and what he calls “the mythology we carry with us, based on our past.” Such an uncommon artist warrants a less conventional survey than this one.
