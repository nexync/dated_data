RIO DE JANEIRO — The United States won the women’s 4x100-meter relay on Friday, taking a final for which they almost did not qualify.
The win denied the Jamaican sprinter Elaine Thompson her third gold medal of the Games. Jamaica won the silver medal and Britain the bronze. The winning time was 41.01.
The American team was anchored by Tori Bowie, who won silver in the 100 and bronze in the 200.
The United States advanced to the final only by winning an appeal after dropping the baton in the heats. It was ruled that a Brazilian runner had interfered with Allyson Felix, and the team was allowed a special rerun. If it ran faster than the last qualifier, the American team would advance. It did, with the fastest time of the day.
English Gardner and Tianna Bartoletta rounded out the team.
The Jamaican team included Thompson, who won both the 100 and 200 earlier in the meet, and was anchored by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, the 100 winner in 2008 and 2012 and the bronze medalist here.
The United States was the defending champion after setting a world record of 40.82 in London.
