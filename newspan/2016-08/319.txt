James D. Watson’s fetched $4.76 million in 2014, setting a record. William Faulkner’s failed to sell in 2013, after bidding stalled out at $425,000, short of the minimum.
Now, the Nobel Prize medal belonging to the mathematician John F. Nash, awarded in recognition of his fundamental contributions to game theory, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby’s in New York on Oct. 17. It carries an estimate of $2.5 to $4 million, which if reached will cement the apparent dominance — for now? — of scientists over literary types in the rarefied market for some of the world’s most difficult-to-acquire gold jewelry.
Mr. Nash’s medal, which is being offered in its original red leather case, is only one of about a dozen Nobel medals known to have been sold at auction in the past few years, according to Sotheby’s, as part of a boomlet sometimes attributed to $2.2 million price fetched in 2012 by the medal awarded to Francis Crick, who is among the discoverers with Mr. Watson of the double-helix structure of DNA. Scientists are not the only one to break $1 million: The 1936 Nobel Peace Prize medal awarded in 1936 to Carlos Saavedra Lamas, a former foreign minister of Argentina, sold for $1.1 million in 2014.
