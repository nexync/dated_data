It was women who pioneered wearing watches on the wrist. Queen Elizabeth was given an intricately bejeweled one by the Earl of Leicester in 1572; the Queen of Naples had a band made of hair and gold thread. While men continued to keep their watches in their pockets, sporty 19th-century ladies wore timepieces with leather straps while on horseback and bicycles. Ralph Lauren channels that intrepid spirit with his first collection of round watches for women, RL888, named for the address of his flagship Madison Avenue mansion. The selection features Breguet-style hands and a bold combination of Arabic and Roman numerals. Many have interchangeable straps, including this one made of slick black alligator.
