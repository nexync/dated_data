In a legal reshuffle, Monique Pressley, a lawyer for Bill Cosby who became something of a public face for the entertainer in his battle against allegations of sexual assault made by many women, is no longer representing him in any pending legal cases, a spokesman for Mr. Cosby said.
Court filings this week showed Ms. Pressley had been replaced by another lawyer, Angela Agrusa, in a civil case in California, and Mr. Cosby’s spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, confirmed that Ms. Pressley was no longer representing Mr. Cosby in any other civil or criminal matters. Mr. Wyatt would not comment on the reasons for this change. But he praised Ms. Pressley and said it was not uncommon for people involved with high-profile law cases to change their legal representation. “We get hundreds of calls from lawyers who want to be involved in this case,” he said.
Ms. Pressley declined to comment.
The move follows legal defeats in pretrial motions by Mr. Cosby’s team to try to stop a criminal case against him in Pennsylvania, where he is facing sexual assault charges, from moving forward. Another lawyer who had featured prominently in his defense in the pretrial hearings withdrew in July. Last October, Mr. Cosby also replaced his longtime lawyer Martin D. Singer.
Ms. Pressley began representing Mr. Cosby last summer, her appointment marking the start of a more vigorous public defense around the time of the publication of details of a legal deposition Mr. Cosby had given 10 years earlier.
She defended him in television interviews, appeared with him in public and accompanied him to hearings in the criminal case in Pennsylvania. She also questioned witnesses in the courtroom, but while she had a high profile in the news media she took more of a back seat to other lawyers on Mr. Cosby’s team in court.
She had also acted for Mr. Cosby’s wife, Camille, who gave deposition testimony in a defamation case brought by several women against Mr. Cosby in Massachusetts.
