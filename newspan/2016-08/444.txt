Italy sits astride a convergence of major and minor fault lines that makes it one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. When a deadly temblor hits — as one did on Wednesday — the country’s emergency response systems kick into gear, helping to rescue the injured and sustain survivors.
But while Italy does a good job of rescuing people after earthquakes, it has done a terrible job of protecting people and buildings ahead of time. It also has fallen short when the emergency crews leave and it is time to rebuild towns.
In 2009, an earthquake killed nearly 300 people and destroyed thousands of buildings in and around the town of L’Aquila, including a new hospital wing presumably built to meet the latest earthquake standards. Seven years and billions of euros later, the center of L’Aquila remains under construction, and many people are still waiting to move into permanent homes.
A lack of dedicated funds is part of the problem. One estimate, by Armando Zambrano, the head of Italy’s National Council of Engineers, puts the cost of strengthening the country’s historic structures at about 93 billion euros ($105 billion). Besides the money issue, the country’s corruption, illegal construction and a cumbersome bureaucracy all work to prevent obvious steps from being taken, like reinforcing existing buildings and ensuring that new buildings meet earthquake standards.
Mr. Renzi is under added pressure to make good on his commitment. He has staked his government on a controversial constitutional reform referendum scheduled in November, and he has said he will resign if the referendum is defeated.
The result of that vote may now well depend on whether he succeeds where so many of his predecessors have failed: delivering on promises to rebuild what has been lost and to reform Italy’s earthquake-preparedness programs, keeping people and the country’s priceless architectural and artistic heritage as safe as possible from the next earthquake.
