Elizabeth Roberts, an architect, with the Knotty Bubbles Sconce, $2,700 to $4,800 at Roll & Hill.
Ms. Roberts, 47, has designed a number of Brooklyn townhouse renovations, as well as the Manhattan restaurant Nix and fashion boutiques for Rachel Comey, and she often uses sconces in her work — in hallways, above headboards, in reading nooks, flanking bathroom mirrors.
• Consider the application. A sconce with an opaque shade will cast light in a single direction, but “if you need to illuminate a whole hallway,” Ms. Roberts said, the sconce “has to glow,” so you’ll need something transparent or translucent.
• If the sconce will be mounted beside a bed, or in tight quarters, make sure it won’t be in the way. “You don’t want to knock your head on it every time you get in or out of bed,” she said.
• Explore the power of multiples. Sconces are often used in pairs, but Ms. Roberts sometimes installs a series — along a staircase or running down a hall, for example — as a design statement with a functional objective.
With a disk-shaped brass reflector that can be rotated around the light bulb, this sconce “has a sense of play, fun and interaction,” Ms. Roberts said. The movable reflector makes the light level easy to adjust and ensures that no one will be blinded by a bare bulb.
This fixture surprised with both its size (more than three and a half feet long) and asymmetrical shape (the two shades point in different directions). “It would need to be in a big, beautiful room,” Ms. Roberts said. But in the right space, it would be a striking sculptural statement.
