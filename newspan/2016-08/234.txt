Some shows are best experienced in a single breathless plunge. The first season of “UnREAL” benefited from a binge: its biggest sticking point (Mary’s tragic turn) became just another wave in a rising tide as the show kept its focus on Rachel and Quinn’s codependent brilliance and the delicious behind-the-scenes machinations of a reality dating show.
When binge-watchers catch up on this season, I suspect they’ll be surprised by the tonal whiplash of “Espionage,” the season’s penultimate episode, compared with the episodes that came just before it. Rachel’s big reveal about her childhood rape is almost forgotten; the aftermath of the police violence Rachel orchestrated has been so sidelined that the biggest consequence she faces here is that Darius doesn’t want to talk to her. The show seems to have finally realized that it has bit off more than it can chew and is determined to refocus on what matters as we look toward next season.
It doesn’t always work. But this episode still demonstrates “UnREAL” in fine form, full of rapid-fire triple-crossing and intrigue both in front of and behind the scenes. It’s an episode that’s actually centered on “Everlasting,” which feels almost novel this season. And it’s a welcome return; there’s a palpable energy as everyone races across the set, so cheek by jowl that nothing goes unseen — Madison catches Yael kissing Coleman; and Tiffany and Chet nearly disrupt filming with a balcony tryst. It’s also a celebration of the full absurdity of the set: feather bouquets in giant vases and staircases so choked with flowers a Disney princess would say it’s a bit much. Its inescapable falsity stands out in sharp relief as Rachel begins to realize where her feelings really lie.
But with her loyalties realigned, Rachel’s not going anywhere until Coleman is ruined.
I appreciate that the season didn’t start out giving Coleman an ulterior motive. Instead, “Everlasting” rotted him slowly from the inside the way it does everyone else. And even now his goals are nicely muddled. The show is toxic and, objectively, deserves to be exposed — but he’s only interested because he’s angry at being sidelined. He’s correct that Rachel’s mental health history makes her an easy target for the network, although he conveniently skips over the part where he tricked her into making a confession and then tapped her phone to get more dirt. But in his haste to torch “Everlasting” and get Rachel to go with him to better things, he’s underestimated the pull Quinn has over Rachel. If Rachel even half-believes that Quinn is in earnest, Quinn wins. And if Quinn’s actually in earnest? Good luck.
Shiri Appleby brings Rachel’s full duplicitous strength to bear as Rachel wavers over whether to expose “Everlasting,” but Coleman clinches it when he triumphantly replays Quinn’s confession. Rachel’s face is a masterpiece of rising vengefulness as he runs through his reasons. The real sting isn’t that Coleman wants to blow up the show. It isn’t even that he suggests she go to a mental health facility to get “whole” — the only reference here to Rachel’s childhood reveal. The sting is that Rachel got produced. He tapped her phone without her knowledge, he got the footage he wanted, and now she’s on her back foot like a contestant. But Coleman’s downfall is that he’s treating her like one; he hasn’t seen her do what we know she can do. “This is all we need,” he promises her. When she agrees, it’s the moment we know he’s doomed. It’s a moment we’ve spent a season waiting for.
• The show still hasn’t made much of a case for Booth, but it’s clear he’s occupying the Fertility-Obsessed Wife slot in a man-centered drama. (Why else give him lines as pointedly awful as “keep that womb warm and dry”?) Just take the silver lining of Quinn snapping at on-set peons and run for it.
• I do think that the way Darius is backed into corners as everything around him falls apart is interesting, though. It’s much subtler than the traffic incident, but every choice he has to make (Yael versus Chantal, to stay or to leave, to choose Tiffany or not) is filtered through racial optics in a way Adam never had to worry about, and it’s worth noting.
• Dan, the longest-suffering AD of the season, has largely been in the background, but the way he braces himself, exhausted, whenever a producer gets a gleam in their eye is great.
