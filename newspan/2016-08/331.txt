The fashion designer shares with T personal images of some of her favorite things, greatest influences and best memories.
Designers today rarely dress the way they design; even those fashioning the most luxurious frocks cultivate a basic look. And then are those few, like Carolina Herrera, whose creations embody their lives. Herrera was born to a prominent Venezuelan clan, and she can still recall the cuts of her mother’s elaborate hats and her father’s riding boots. As a teenager, her grandmother took her to Spain to shop for dresses by Cristóbal Balenciaga. She was already a regal beauty, and by the time she moved to New York in 1980 — becoming a much-photographed regular at Studio 54 — her style was striking enough that former Vogue editor and family friend Diana Vreeland advised her to start her own line of clothing. That was 1981.
