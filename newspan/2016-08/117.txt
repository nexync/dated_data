It was sort of a slow news week in Silicon Valley. Then along came Uber.
On Thursday, the ride-hailing company started the day by unveiling several initiatives around self-driving cars. Those included a partnership with Volvo, under which Uber will begin testing modified self-driving Volvos in Pittsburgh in a matter of weeks. Uber also announced it was acquiring Otto, a self-driving truck start-up stocked with autonomous-car experts who used to work at Google.
It all goes to show how Silicon Valley companies are doubling down on autonomous vehicles, amid a similar rush by the big automakers from Detroit, write Bill Vlasic and Mike Isaac.
Uber closed out the day with more news. A class-action settlement that it had agreed to with former drivers who had sued over their job classification was struck down by a federal judge, writes Mr. Isaac.
The development keeps some troublesome litigation simmering for the company. The drivers had wanted to be categorized as employees of Uber instead of independent contractors. Uber had opposed that, saying drivers have more flexibility as independent contractors; the classification also meant Uber does not need to pay certain worker benefits.
The matter had seemed to be settled in April, when the settlement agreement was forged. Now, who knows?
