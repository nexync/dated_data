Dr. Henderson, who lived in Baltimore, died in a hospice of complications of a hip fracture, including infection with antibiotic-resistant staphylococcus, a dangerous pathogen he had himself researched and raised alarms about, said his daughter, Leigh Henderson.
But, for all his self-confidence, Dr. Henderson could change his mind. Unknown to Mr. Gates, he had actually concluded two days earlier that polio could be beaten. He had been persuaded by the campaign’s new leader, Dr. Ciro de Quadros, a Brazilian veteran of smallpox and measles campaigns, that an improved vaccine and better case monitoring could work; he also had faith in Mr. Gates’s commitment and Dr. de Quadros’s abilities.
Unfortunately, Dr. de Quadros died unexpectedly of pancreatic cancer in 2014, and the battle against polio goes on.
Although Dr. Henderson long argued that the last two stockpiles of smallpox virus, kept in the United States and Russia, should be destroyed, he partly reversed himself in 1998 and said the United States should resume making smallpox vaccine because the threat of a bioterrorism attack loomed. In the prelude to the Iraq war, he endorsed a plan to vaccinate about 500,000 health care workers and emergency responders because of the possibility that Saddam Hussein had weaponized smallpox, a threat that ultimately proved false.
Besides his daughter, Dr. Henderson is survived by his wife, Nana Irene Bragg, and two sons, David and Douglas.
He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in 2002. Although there was talk of a Nobel Prize, none has ever been given for the eradication of smallpox. Most of the field’s leaders, Dr. Lane said, agreed that no one person should get it.
