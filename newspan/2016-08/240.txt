In desperation, she turned to a patient advocacy firm, Patient Navigator, which helps coordinate care, do in-depth clinical research and find appropriate doctors. A professional there examined Ms. Newmyerâ€™s bills, checking for errors, and ultimately negotiated lower payments. The amount saved was at least $10,000, Ms. Newmyer said.
As patients like Ms. Newmyer struggle to cope with the dizzying demands of a trillion-dollar health care system that generates most of its revenues from older people, they are increasingly turning to patient advocates for help. The profession, officially seven years old, now has about 650 advocates, including doctors, and is growing rapidly, according to the Alliance of Professional Health Advocates.
Patient advocates are springing up to handle everything from finding doctors for hard-to-diagnose diseases to negotiating medical payments with hospitals and doctors and pressing insurance companies to cover claims.
The rise of this new cottage industry reflects not just the difficulties of navigating a complex health care system, but the unequal power relationships between providers and insurers on one side of the equation, and patients and families on the other, said Lisa McGiffert, director of the Safe Patient Project at Consumers Union.
