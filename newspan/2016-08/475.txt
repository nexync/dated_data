WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — When we last saw Neville Fogarty, he was looking at what happens when you break apart a common word; today he is doing something similar without being repetitive, so kudos to him. The theme was so much fun, it brought a song to my lips. Perhaps it did for you, too.
The word “in” can be used in a few different contexts, but what if we took it literally? What if we took some popular songs that contain the word “in” in the title and proceed to stuff the title’s verb literally inside the noun?
Dr. Fogarty (who just earned his Ph.D) does just that and it works beautifully, as long as by “beautifully” you mean that you don’t mind writing total gibberish inside your grid. I loved it, and while the theme felt like a later-week one, it works well here and is balanced by nontheme clues that are on the easier side.
In nontheme news, there’s a lot of good trivia for people of all ages in Dr. Fogarty’s grid, and I thought the two long Downs, LOS ANGELES and FOUND MONEY, were very cleverly clued.
• 36A: AL OERTER was not only an Olympic athlete who won four consecutive Olympic gold medals, but he also broke records each time he did it. You can read more about him here.
• 51A: It’s midweek, and here comes the wordplay: A Catholic Cardinal’s cap has no letter, but the St. Louis Cardinals’ caps do (STL).
• 55A: A very cryptic clue, that “P.” When you see something like that, think about whether there is a Greek letter that might look like that. In today’s puzzle, that letter would be RHO.
• 1D: Not that Hamlet, at least not today.  Putting the word “hamlet” at the beginning of the clue allows the clue writer to capitalize the H, tricking you into think about the tragic Dane. Today, the clue is about the kind of hamlet that is a small geographic settlement, and the relative would be a TOWN.
• 11D: Not that Venice, although that would be nice. Today, we’re supposed to be thinking about Venice Beach in LOS ANGELES.
• 30D: Even with a puzzle theme this literal, we’re not going literal with this particular clue. Watch that question mark: “Change out of an old pair of pants?” is not referring to changing your clothes, it’s referring to loose change that you might find in and get out of an old pair of pants, which is always a happy thing. The answer today is FOUND MONEY.
Greetings from Columbus, Ohio! While you’re solving today’s crossword, I’m attending MathFest, the annual summer meeting of the Mathematical Association of America. If you’re also at the conference, please find me and say hello! If you’re not, then I hope you enjoyed my mathy clue for AUNT. The initial letters of “Please excuse my dear Aunt Sally” can help you remember the order of operations: parentheses, exponentiation, multiplication/division, addition/subtraction.
I came up with the idea for this puzzle one Sunday morning while driving, when Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark” came on the radio. I was certain that this “XXXX IN THE YYYY turns into YYXXXXYY” concept had been done before, but I thought I might be able to make a tight theme out of it by focusing on song titles. After a lot of brainstorming, I chose a diverse collection of songs so that solvers of all ages could find a foothold with this puzzle’s theme.
I hope you found it to be a challenging (but fun!) Wednesday puzzle.
That it was, Dr. Fogarty. Hope to see you again soon.
