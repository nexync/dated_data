Ellicott City, Md., was devastated by flooding on Saturday night, which left two people dead.
Ellicott City, Md., a historic town west of Baltimore, was devastated by flooding on Saturday night after more than six inches of rain fell in just two hours, sending a fast-moving current down its Main Street and leaving at least two people dead.
Officials and witnesses said the floodwaters rushed through the downtown area after torrential rain fell between 7 and 9 p.m. It ripped up sidewalks, gutted many of the town’s quaint shops and carried off vehicles, depositing some of them blocks away.
The body of a woman was recovered from the nearby Patapsco River early on Sunday, and the body of a man was also found, said Mark Miller, a spokesman for Howard County, where Ellicott City is the county seat.
Gov. Larry Hogan and Representative Elijah E. Cummings visited the destruction early on Sunday. Mr. Hogan signed an executive order declaring a state of emergency for Howard County.
“Recovering from this disaster will be long and difficult,” he said.
The downtown area has been evacuated and closed off while emergency crews assess the safety of the buildings there. County officials asked residents to be patient during what some anticipated would be a monthslong rebuilding process.
Founded in 1772 as a mill town, Ellicott City has for the past several decades catered to tourists with its historic charm and antique shops, said Shawn Gladden, the executive director of the Howard County Historical Society.
Despite the warnings, the ferocity of the waters came as a surprise to many workers and residents in downtown Ellicott City, trapping them where they were. Inside Bean Hollow, the water rose swiftly to about three feet. With no time to flee, the coffee shop’s workers scrambled to an apartment on the second floor.
