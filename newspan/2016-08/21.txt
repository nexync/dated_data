When: 10:19 p.m. local time, 9:19 p.m. Eastern.
Having won the 400-meter freestyle, Ledecky continues her pursuit of matching Debbie Meyer’s 200-400-800-freestyle gold medal haul at the 1968 Olympics. Ledecky was out-touched by her main rival, Sarah Sjostrom, in the semifinals of the 200-meter freestyle. But “it’s the third round that counts,” said Ledecky, who set the world record in the 400 freestyle Saturday and is the overwhelming favorite in the 800 freestyle.
Then there is Phelps, who could win his 20th and 21st career gold medals. His night will begin with a bid to avenge his unexpected 2012 loss to Chad le Clos of South Africa in the 200 butterfly. Phelps made his first Olympic team in 2000, at age 15, in the event, and he has held the world record continuously since 2001. He was the second-fastest qualifier in the semifinals behind Tamas Kenderesi, of Hungary, who was 3 when Phelps finished fifth at the 2000 Summer Games, in Sydney, Australia. In an athlete bio for the Olympics, Kenderesi listed Phelps as his hero. So did le Clos in 2012, and we saw how that played out.
When: 11:38 p.m. local time, 10:38 p.m. Eastern.
Phelps, 31, is also expected to swim in the final of the 4x200 freestyle relay, which the United States has won four times since finishing third at the 1992 Olympics behind Sweden (silver) and a Unified team of athletes from the former Soviet Union (gold). Phelps, a first-time father whose young son is in Rio, is dealing with more distractions at these Games than at any other, but his scowling race face Monday night made it feel as if it were 2008 again. Phelps won a record eight gold medals at the Games that year, in Beijing.
Even as they chase history, Ledecky and Phelps could be overshadowed by Hosszu, the Hungarian who won the 100-meter backstroke and 400-meter individual medley and is the favorite in the 200 individual medley. She is the world-record holder, and she broke the Olympic record Monday in a preliminary heat. With a victory, she will join the likes of Shane Gould, Janet Evans, Kornelia Ender and Inge de Bruijn as triple gold medalists in individual events in a single Games.
Hosszu, 27, who acquired the nickname the Iron Lady because of her ability to race several events in a single session, scratched out of the 200 butterfly Tuesday afternoon, presumably to rest for the 200 I.M. final.
Hosszu’s husband, Shane, who is also her coach, has gained notice for his animated presence.
He has reason to be excited. After Tuesday, Hosszu has one event remaining, the 200 backstroke, giving her the chance to tie the East German Kristin Otto’s mark of four individual golds.
