RIO DE JANEIRO — The Brazilian police arrested the Moroccan Olympic boxer Hassan Saada on Friday morning on charges of sexually assaulting two workers at the Olympic Village. He is to be held for 15 days, according to a court statement, making it likely that he will miss his fight scheduled for Saturday.
The arrest was made after an order on Thursday by Judge Larissa Nunes Saly of a special Rio de Janeiro state court created in 2013 for large events, especially sporting ones like the 2014 World Cup. The court will have seven outposts during the Summer Games.
The attack took place on Wednesday, according to a police statement. The accusers are two Brazilian women who work in Morocco’s wing of the Olympic Village. They told the police that Saada had initially asked to take a photograph with them and that he had then tried to kiss them, using force.
Saada, a light heavyweight, was scheduled to box Saturday against Mehmet Nadir Unal of Turkey.
“It is unbelievable that an athlete who should be coming to a country to participate in the Olympic spirit has total disrespect for those who welcome him, committing grave acts that would be repudiated in any part of the world,” Judge Saly said in a court statement.
