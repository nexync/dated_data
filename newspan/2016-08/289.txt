Harry Fujiwara, known to generations of wrestling fans as Mr. Fuji, a bruising martial arts master whose signature move, hurling a handful of salt into his opponents’ eyes, left them in tears, died on Sunday in Knoxville, Tenn. He was 82.
World Wrestling Entertainment announced his death without specifying the cause.
Mr. Fuji, as he was known in wrestling circles, was a vigorous villain and a force to be reckoned with, especially when he partnered with Professor Toru Tanaka. Together, they won several tag-team titles before Mr. Fuji became a manager.
On his own, Mr. Fuji tangled with wrestlers like Chief Jay Strongbow and Pedro Morales. His tossing a fistful of salt into an opponent’s eyes, briefly blinding him, was his best-known dirty trick. He hid the salt in tiny bags in his tights, to the consternation of referees and anyone who got in the ring against him.
Mr. Fuji retired from the ring in 1985 and managed many bad-guy wrestlers. His protégés included George (the Animal) Steele, Killer Khan, Yokozuna and Don Muraco. He was inducted into the W.W.E. Hall of Fame in 2007.
Harry Masayoshi Fujiwara was born on May 4, 1934. He grew up in Hawaii and graduated from McKinley High School there before he became a wrestler.
His survivors include seven children — Tyran Wong, Teri Deettula, Tami Nelson, Kimberly Brewster, Toni Will, Kelli Fujiwara Sloan and Kevin Fujiwara — as well as 13 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
