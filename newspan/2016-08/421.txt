Since 2012, the Amsterdam-based creative group Steinbeisser has thrown the sort of challenging “experimental gastronomy” dinners reflected in the agency’s name, which in German means “biting on rock” — and the dishes and eating utensils are as thought-provoking as the food. On commissioned tableware such as rocking plates and arm’s-length spoons, dishes from such Michelin-lauded chefs as David Kinch of Manresa, Tanja Grandits of Stucki and Corey Lee of Benu bring diners out of their “comfort zone,” as the Steinbeisser co-founder Martin Kullik describes it, “showing different perspectives of how we can relate to food and to one another.” Just as the multicourse meals are entirely biodynamic and preservative-free — and crafted with carefully sourced ingredients — the implements are similarly considered, carved and forged by contemporary jewelry designers and woodworkers from materials found in the area where each dinner is held, from Berlin to Basel to an upcoming meal in Saratoga, Calif.
Starting today, a limited selection of these plates and forks will be available for purchase on the new website Jouw, so even less-lauded cooks can experience what Kullik describes as a side effect of eating at an unconventional table setting: savoring the food. As he explains, not following the “normal rules of usability” and efficiency in tableware made diners “eat considerably slower,” thus encouraging the particular rumination involved in “extra chewing.” Here Kullik highlights some of the artists’ works, which explore heft, balance and color psychology (such as gold, to enhance sweetness), and which are available in the new store.
