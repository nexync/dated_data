So the reporter Nico Hines — a straight man who is married and has one child — headed to the Olympic Village in Rio de Janeiro seeking dates using various apps.
He gained three in a single hour, and in an article published on Thursday went on to describe in detail the responses he received on Grindr, the gay dating app. No names were mentioned, but the article was so detailed, it was not hard to guess the identities of the men he had contacted, and not all of them were from gay-friendly countries.
The story was quickly condemned on social media. After trying to smooth things over with a revised story and an editor’s note, The Daily Beast changed course on Thursday night and took the unusual step of pulling the story entirely.
In an earlier note, after the story was revised in response to the barrage of criticism, The Daily Beast’s editor in chief, John Avlon, said editors had removed details that might identify the athletes. He also responded to complaints that Mr. Hines’s original article mocked or shamed the athletes who responded to Mr. Hines’s overtures on Grindr.
“We do not feel he did this in any way,” he said.
But at 9 p.m., the article and the original editor’s note were gone, and replaced with a note describing how the organization took the “unprecedented but necessary step” of removing the entire article.
Mr. Avlon and The Daily Beast’s executive editor, Noah Shachtman, both shared the new editors’ note on Twitter, expressing regret.
Mr. Hines, reached by email before the article was removed, declined to comment on Thursday night.
In the article, he described what he encountered: profiles of athletes competing in various events, including an individual “from a notoriously homophobic country”; photos of Olympic bedspreads; and a frank exchange with one user.
The article drew significant backlash from gay leaders and athletes.
He said it was good that the article had been removed but that it came too late.
