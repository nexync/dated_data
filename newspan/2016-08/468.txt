I admit it: I have Olympic fever. (Though I’m worried we’re supposed to reserve that phrase this year for the diseases athletes might contract swimming and sailing in contaminated water.) The opening ceremony is on Friday, and I am so ready. I’m also following a ton of Olympians on Instagram, and it’s already glorious. I’m pulling for gymnast Oksana Chusovitina, who at age 41 is competing in her seventh Olympics.
This week there’s also some lovely catching up to do, and some solid documentaries. I’ll also be watching E!’s “Botched by Nature,” a spinoff to one of my secret favorites “Botched.” If you also have a secret favorite show people might be surprised to hear you love, let me know |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| The FX series “You’re the Worst” returns for its third season Aug. 31, which gives you plenty of time to watch or rewatch these episodes. The show stars Aya Cash and Chris Geere as Gretchen and Jimmy, a misanthropic yet wildly appealing unlikely couple.
A captivating push-pull exists between the characters’ own cynicism and the broader show’s abundant warmth. The dialogue is so salty it can burn your eyes, yet everyone is capable of kindness, and their lives are demonstrably better for having one another.
The show hits most of the rom-com setups — the meet-cute, the awkward merging of social circles, the sharing of a big secret, the moments of cold feet — squarely and enthusiastically, but rather than sweetheart characters giddily smooching, Gretchen and Jimmy are doing drugs and viciously making fun of people.
Season 1 was largely about their courtship, and Season 2 digs in a bit harder and focuses more on Gretchen’s clinical depression. It is less funny but much deeper.
In the Mood for Some Olympic Documentaries?
If you think the International Olympic Committee of today has issues, well, journey back in time to the 1936, when the organization teamed up with the Nazis. “The Nazi Games” also explains just how much contemporary Olympic spectacle has its roots in these specific games.
“The Boys of ’36,” based on the book “The Boys in the Boat,” covers the underdog American rowing team who won gold in Berlin.
Finally, “T-Rex: Her Fight for Gold” tells the story of the boxer Claressa Shields, who won a gold medal in London. That alone is a stunning achievement, and Shields accomplished it as a 17-year-old from an unstable household in Flint, Mich., with a coach who also has a day job.
Also: “Carlito’s Way,” “Scent of a Woman” and “Brooklyn,” (available the night of Aug. 13) a nominee for best picture in 2015.
Which ‘Gilmore Girls’ Should I Rewatch?
Are you trying to figure out what to watch next? (Or what to give up on completely?) Watching is here to help. Send your questions to |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| That gives you a solid chunk of time to revisit a ton of episodes, and I do recommend watching Season 7. Amy Sherman-Palladino has said that the new episodes treat that season as canon, and there are some important plotlines that emerge. That season has a bad reputation, but it’s not actually as bad as people think.
You have about four months for this rewatch, so one option would be just rewatch one entire season. My pick would be Season 4, because it lays important groundwork for everyone and is also great. But if you just want key episodes, here we go. All are available on Netflix.
•“The Bracebridge Dinner,” for some of the best Emily/Richard stuff.
•“Secrets and Loans,” for a good Lorelai–Rory–grandparents triangulation.
•“It Should’ve Been Lorelai,” for the Christopher and Lorelai history.
•“Lorelai’s Graduation Day,” for Rory and Jess nonsense.
•“I Can’t Get Started,” for the best moment of acting on the whole show. It’s when Lauren Graham says “congratulations” to Christopher, and it just knocks me out.
•“They Shoot Gilmores, Don’t They?”, because it’s the famous dance-marathon episode.
•“A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving,” for its great Lane moments.
•“The Big One,” for Paris’s meltdown.
•“Those Are Strings, Pinocchio,” because of Rory’s graduation speech. Sob.
•“Ted Koppel’s Big Night Out,” for Paris and Rory bonding and also insecure Emily.
•“Scene in a Mall,” for Emily opening up a little to Lorelai and Rory.
•“Luke Can See Her Face,” “Last Week Fights, This Week Tights,” and “Raincoats and Recipes.” These are three of the best, most important episodes of the show — every important relationship transitions somehow over these three.
•“You Jump, I Jump, Jack,” for the introduction of Logan.
•“Women of Questionable Morals,” again for Lorelai and Christopher stuff.
•“Wedding Bell Blues,” because it features Emily dancing and also one of the great fights of the series.
•“Jews and Chinese Food,” for Kirk-as-Tevye alone.
•“Blame Booze and Melville” and “A House Is Not a Home,” for Rory’s crack up.
 But O.K.
•“Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing Out,” for the return of Jess.
•“The Prodigal Daughter Returns,” for the reunion of Rory and Lorelai and sadly the debut of April Nardini.
•“Partings,” because of the Luke and Lorelai fight.
•“That’s What You Get, Folks, for Makin’ Whoopee,” because judgmental Rory is fundamental to the series.
•“French Twist,” for the Lorelai and Christopher leaps.
That’s only 27 total episodes. My guess is along the way, you’ll realize you love an episode that I left off this list and decide to flesh out this skeleton a bit.
