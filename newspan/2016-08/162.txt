• Build the wall.
• End the catch and release policy for undocumented immigrants and instead return them to their country of origin.
• Have zero tolerance for undocumented immigrants who have committed a crime, and deport them.
• Triple the number of deportation officers at the department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
• Stop issuing visas to any country where “adequate screening cannot occur” that might endanger national security;.
• Ensure foreign countries take back deported immigrants from the United States (Mr. Trump said 23 countries refuse to do so).
• Complete a biometric entry and exit visa tracking system under development. “It will be on land, it will be on sea, it will be in the air,” he said.
• Mr. Trump made the case that Washington elites and the media have put the focus, wrongly, on the plight of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, rather than the Americans impacted by their presence.
• Comparing himself to Hillary Clinton, who he maligned throughout the speech, Mr. Trump asked: “What do you have to lose? Choose me.” It was an echo of a much mocked question he asked black voters recently.
• “Maybe they’ll be able to deport her.” Mr. Trump wondered provocatively, whether it’s possible to send Mrs. Clinton out of the country.
• Mr. Trump invited onto the stage the mothers and fathers of Americans whose children were killed by undocumented immigrants. He asked each to describe their children and how they died. He then kissed many of them on the cheek. It was the most emotional moment of the speech. “If you don’t vote Trump, we won’t have a country,” one of the mother told the audience.
Here are the highlights from Mr. Trump’s trip to Mexico: He reached out to the Mexican president and people.
But Mr. Trump said he also told Mr. Peña Nieto directly that he felt Mexico had benefited disproportionately from its trade agreements with the United States, and that he had described illegal immigration as a problem for both countries.
He raised his plan to build a wall, but there’s a dispute over whether he and Mr. Peña Nieto discussed who would pay for it.
Mr. Trump said the two did not discuss the issue of forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall — one of the signature promises of his campaign. Mr. Peña Nieto did not challenge the idea during the news conference but later posted on Twitter that, during his meeting with Mr. Trump, he had made it clear that Mexico wouldn’t pay for the wall.
Mr. Peña Nieto pressed Mr. Trump on his contentious comments and pushed back against his assertions on trade.
Mr. Peña Nieto pushed back in the gentlest of terms on several of Mr. Trump’s claims on Nafta, citing U.S. Chamber of Commerce statistics to argue that free trade had been beneficial for both countries and stressing the economic importance of easy movement across the border.
Donald J. Trump and Enrique Peña Nieto spoke about his visit to Mexico. Mr. Trump said his plan to build a border wall was discussed, but not who would pay for it.
N/AS Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Wednesday told an audience in Mexico City that “millions of Mexican Americans” contributed to the United States.
Despite a call on social media for anti-Trump protesters, the turnout at one rally was underwhelming.
The showing was something of a surprise, considering the sense of betrayal among many Mexicans, who feel that their president sold them out to the worst possible person.
By the start time of 11 a.m., there were dozens of journalist but only a few protesters. A half-hour later, the number of protesters — at least those being vocal and carrying anti-Trump signs — seemed stuck at four, including a guy wearing a Mexican wrestling mask, while the number of journalists topped 50. By 12:30 p.m., there were no more than 10 demonstrators, while the journalist pack continued to balloon.
Still, the protesters did their best to represent the anger and disappointment that many Mexicans have expressed toward Mr. Trump as well as toward Mr. Peña Nieto, who is struggling with low approval ratings and a string of scandals. He has spoken out sharply against Mr. Trump in the past, saying in a television interview last month that there was “no way” Mexico would pay for a border wall, and earlier comparing Mr. Trump’s campaign to the rise of Hitler.
“The president didn’t represent the Mexican people, he didn’t consult with us,” said the demonstrator in the wrestling mask, who called himself “Maldito Perro” — Damned Dog — though later said his real name was Diego Garcia.
He admitted to being disappointed by the anemic turnout. Social media activity, he lamented, seemed to be replacing the time-honored tradition of the street protest.
