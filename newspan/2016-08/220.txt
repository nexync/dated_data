MARVEL’S JESSICA JONES on Netflix. Krysten Ritter skulks around as a tormented gumshoe with an alcohol problem, who’s living in Hell’s Kitchen and has put her superhero past behind her, mostly — except to get at her tormentor, a mutant with a special kind of mind control who can make women do what he wants. (He’s David Tennant, after all.) Mike Colter makes his debut as Luke Cage, an ex-con with unbreakable skin, who gets his own series on Sept. 30.
