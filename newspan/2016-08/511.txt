As much as any two performers, Michael Feinstein and Marilyn Maye embody the traditional concept of show business professionalism, in which an entertainer is expected to wow an audience by doing it all. And on Tuesday night, they joined forces for a satisfying evening of upbeat camaraderie and nostalgia at Feinstein’s/54 Below.
Their program, “Summertime Swing,” was an old-fashioned variety show, blending standards with Catskill humor, celebrity impersonations and other vaudevillian shenanigans. Mr. Feinstein alternated on piano with the musical director, Tedd Firth; Sean Smith on bass and Mark McLean on drums kept the tempos and dynamics continuously fluid.
For Ms. Maye, 88, it means defying gravity and singing with the force of a performer half her age, exploring the many layers of a voice whose richness and warmth remain nearly undiminished. Underneath her brass is a sophisticated jazz singer and wise storyteller who can bring tears to your eyes.
Like Ms. Maye, Mr. Feinstein, who will turn 60 on Sept. 7, has grown into a confident, seasoned trouper. It wasn’t so long ago that he was the new kid on the block, determined to celebrate and nurture the American Songbook. A repository of encyclopedic lore about Broadway and Hollywood, he has earned the mystique of an ultimate authority. You couldn’t ask for a more devoted keeper of the flame.
