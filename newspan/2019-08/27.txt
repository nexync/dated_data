I’m not a big consumer of technology, on the whole — I mean, I work in the Books department of a newspaper that started in 1851 — but I told a friend recently that I’ve become fond of the little smart speaker on my kitchen countertop, mainly because it lets me tune into old-fashioned local radio stations from all over the place. I live in Connecticut, but these days when I do the dishes you’re as likely to find me listening to the latest news and music out of Philadelphia or Austin or Minneapolis as you are out of New York. The greater metro area has grown a lot greater.
Of course, books always did have the ability to draw other places near — and without eavesdropping on your conversations, either. This week our recommended titles include close-up looks at New Orleans (“The Yellow House”) and Lebanon (“Beirut Hellfire Society”), India under the Raj (“The Patient Assassin”) and the American West (both “Grinnell” and “Escalante’s Dream”). We also have a biography of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, a novel about white supremacy and another based on a real-life art forgery, and an immigrant’s study of the forces driving global migration today.
