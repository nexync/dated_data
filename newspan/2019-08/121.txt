A reader with relatives in China does not think that the protesters will succeed in loosening Beijingâ€™s grip.
I was in China in 1997 on the day that Britain returned the crown colony to China, and I have recently returned from a monthlong trip to western China visiting friends and family. The folks I spent the month with included middle-aged men and women who have seen changes in China that were unimaginable when they were born, and young people who have known only prosperity and good times.
The most important thing to many Chinese is order, and what is happening in Hong Kong does not look like order to them. Chinese society puts great value on success, but that success must be achieved within the parameters that Chinese society sets.
The 1989 Tiananmen uprising occurred as the Warsaw Pact was in the process of self-destructing. The old men who gave up power in places like Prague and Warsaw realized it was time to go. The men in Beijing were not going to let that happen. Not in Beijing in 1989 and not in Hong Kong today.
