On a spring day nearly seven years ago, I stepped away from my desk as C.E.O. of my then-fledgling filmmaking company to grab some lunch with my team in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. Bored with our usual haunts, we landed on H. Salt Esq. Authentic English Fish and Chips, a curious ’70s-style fast-food counter in a sleepy strip mall on Hollywood Boulevard. Stepping inside, I was overwhelmed with the same sensation I had on my first visit to the original Disneyland Park in Anaheim: Someone with a vision built this place.
As a Nova Scotian, I am a fish-and-chips connoisseur by birthright. (To interested parties, look no further than the Island View Family Restaurant & Bakery in Western Shore, Nova Scotia, for the best I’ve had.) And so it struck me as odd to find a business peddling England’s greasy export in the land of $23 gluten-free avocado toast and detox blender bars.
It was lunchtime and H. Salt was empty. “How is this place still in business?” I remember thinking. The fish must be amazing, a cult favorite. I ordered a two-piece. It wasn’t. I needed to know more.
As someone who immigrated to the United States to build a company, I felt a kinship with Mr. Salt. His story poses big questions: What’s more important, integrity of vision or financial success? Is bigger always better? What, really, is the difference between Colonel Sanders and Haddon Salt? If there’s such a fine line between ending up as a household name or as cultural footnote, are founders really the right people to venerate? And where on earth can I get good fish and chips these days anyway?
