The film, called “El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,” will expand on the story of Jesse Pinkman, the excitable meth cook and former partner of Walter White.
Nearly six years ago, viewers of “Breaking Bad” watched the final episode of that series, in which the drug kingpin Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston) emerged from hiding and sacrificed his life to rescue his one-time partner, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) from an Aryan Brotherhood gang. When White expired in a meth lab and the credits rolled, audiences believed it might be the last time they would see many of these characters.
But it turns out the story of “Breaking Bad” isn’t quite finished.
Netflix announced on Saturday that it will release a new “Breaking Bad” movie that will center on Pinkman, the excitable meth cook played by Paul, who was last seen in the TV series speeding off in a stolen Chevrolet El Camino to parts unknown.
The film, called “El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,” was written and directed by Vince Gilligan, the creator of “Breaking Bad,” and will be released on Netflix on Oct. 11. The film is also expected to be broadcast at a later date on AMC, the cable network where the TV series was originally shown from 2008 to 2013.
Paul said in the interview that he was forbidden from revealing anything more about what happens in the film. But, like the show’s fans, he said he also believed he had said goodbye to the world of “Breaking Bad” when the TV series concluded.
While it might be reasonable to wonder if “El Camino” will reunite him with other notable “Breaking Bad” alumni like Cranston, Odenkirk, Krysten Ritter or Jonathan Banks, Paul said he once again had to remain silent on this subject.
“All I can say, I think people will be really happy with what they see,” he explained.
Paul is holding onto a lot of professional secrets these days: He will also be appearing in the coming third season of the HBO science-fiction series “Westworld,” in a role he said he could not yet disclose.
