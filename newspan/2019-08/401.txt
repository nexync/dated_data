In Cathleen Schine’s 1998 novel “The Evolution of Jane,” a young woman unexpectedly runs into her childhood best friend in the Galápagos.
Three cheers for fiction writers who bother to get their facts straight. If there’s a special place for them in heaven, it needn’t be very large. The laws of nature are routinely broken and bent to artistic whim as the heroes of novel and film carry on in bucolic scenes where plants bloom and birds nest out of season, often on the wrong continent altogether.
We should rejoice, then, in a rare book like Cathleen Schine’s novel “The Evolution of Jane,” in which a character named Jane and the principles of evolution are rendered with equal care.
The book is a beautifully descriptive travelogue of the Galápagos, loaded with mini-lectures on natural history, evolutionary theory and Darwiniana, wrapped around a rollicking family saga tinged with hints of sexual intrigue.
As a literary enterprise, it bravely carves metaphors out of scientific principles that cannot be reduced to sound bites. My hat is off to any writer who can render such complex ideas comprehensibly.
