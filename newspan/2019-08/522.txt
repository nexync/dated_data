A “Here to Help” article on Thursday about reducing unwanted mail misspelled the surname of a spokesman for the Association of National Advertisers. He is John Wolfe, not Wolf.
An obituary on Thursday about the Broadway producer and director Hal Prince misstated Mr. Prince’s role in the 1978 Broadway musical “On the Twentieth Century.” He directed it; he did not produce it. (The production had several producers.) A photo caption with an image from a performance of his remake of “Show Boat” misstated the year of the performance. It was 1994, not 1998.
An obituary on Wednesday about the Hungarian philosopher Agnes Heller included a quotation from a statement by Judith Friedlander, a former dean of the New School for Social Research in New York, that conveyed imprecisely Dr. Friedlander’s thoughts about Ms. Heller’s death. While some of Ms. Heller’s colleagues and friends expressed skepticism about the circumstances of her death, Dr. Friedlander did not. The quotation has been removed from the obituary.
