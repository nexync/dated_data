Crosswords & Games|What the Heck Is That?
A look at one of the entries from last week’s crossword puzzles that stumped our solvers.
The protest song writer Mr. OCHS — who preferred to be called a “topical” singer — was the subject of a clue that stumped many solvers in the Wednesday, Aug. 21, crossword by Samuel Donaldson. He was known for his fiery and sometimes bitingly satirical songs protesting the Vietnam War, including “I Ain’t Marching Anymore” and “Draft Dodger Rag.” He also wrote songs about the civil rights issues of the early 1960s.
Multiple issues triggered an emotional downward spiral for Mr. OCHS: He felt that he had never achieved the fame he believed he deserved, an injury during a mugging destroyed part of his vocal range and he struggled for years with bipolar disorder and alcoholism. Mr. OCHS died by suicide in 1976 at the age of 35.
