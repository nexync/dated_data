Style|Wait, People Pay for Tinder?
Like a mobile game, the dating app offers paid features that increase the odds of success. Lots of people are buying.
And it’s only getting bigger: Tinder announced on Tuesday that it had added more than 500,000 subscribers worldwide in the last quarter, for a total of more than five million people paying for Tinder Gold or the less expensive Tinder Plus.
Mr. Swidler said that roughly 70 percent of Tinder’s revenue comes from subscriptions; the other 30 percent comes from à la carte features, along with a small amount from advertising.
“You get a huge advantage by getting a lot of free users,” Mr. Swidler said, explaining the company’s “product first, then monetization” strategy. Essentially, the larger the pool of people using Tinder, the more who might eventually pay for certain benefits. If they get frustrated enough.
