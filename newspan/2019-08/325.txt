This unit will invite students to take any STEM-related discovery, process or idea they like and write about it in a way that makes it understandable and engaging for a general audience.
The short pieces in the Trilobites column of the Science Times, which unearth “fascinating morsels of science” each week, will be our chief models to demonstrate how skilled writers can elucidate complex topics.
At the end of the unit, we’ll invite teenagers to submit their own writing to a new STEM-writing contest (details to come!) to show us what they’ve learned.
This year we will help support the contest with great examples from The Times and around the web, as well as with mentor texts that offer guided practice in understanding elements and techniques.
We will use our new Mentor Text feature to spotlight the work of past winners, and explain why newsroom judges admired their thinking.
Because this is our most open-ended contest — students can choose whatever they like, and react however they like — it has proved over the years to be a useful place for young writers to hone their voices, practice skills and take risks.
