The episode caused traffic delays on a span connecting Upper Manhattan and New Jersey.
Both levels of the George Washington Bridge were temporarily closed to traffic on Thursday night after a suspicious package was discovered on the span connecting New York and New Jersey, the authorities said.
The New York Police Departmentâ€™s bomb squad removed an empty cylinder from the New Jersey side of the upper level, the authorities said.
The episode began around 9:30 p.m., with the upper level shut down for police activity, followed by the lower level.
The police did a sweep of the eastbound lanes of the upper level before the span reopened. Both levels were reopened to traffic by 11:30 p.m., the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.
Further details about the package and how it came to the attention of the authorities were not immediately available.
