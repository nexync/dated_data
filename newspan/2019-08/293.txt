After reports of misconduct in the ranks of the elite commando force, the head of Naval Special Warfare, Rear Adm. Collin P. Green, calls for immediate action.
The letter, dated July 25 and obtained on Thursday by The New York Times, appeared to be prompted by a series of recent reports of serious misconduct involving SEALs, including two that recently surfaced.
Some units “have failed to maintain good order and discipline, and as a result and for good reason, our N.S.W. culture is being questioned,” Admiral Green wrote in his letter, referring to his command, Naval Special Warfare.
The admiral instructed the officers beneath him to report back by next Wednesday with plans to eliminate the problem.
The admiral told his officers to get the urgency of his message across to everyone in Naval Special Warfare. “I want all hands to understand that we have a problem, and that this is our main effort and my top priority,” he wrote.
On Wednesday, Vice Adm. Michael Gilday, President Trump’s choice to be the next chief of naval operations, said the Navy SEAL incidents are being investigated, and he would deal with the root causes behind them and hold people accountable.
Accounts of drug use among senior enlisted SEALs also emerged in the high-profile war-crimes trial of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher, who has since been demoted. He was acquitted in early July of charges that he had shot unarmed civilians and stabbed a wounded captive to death while leading a platoon in Iraq in 2017. He was convicted of posing for photographs with the teenage captive’s corpse.
Chief Gallagher had a reputation within the SEALs as one of the commando force’s “pirates” — operators more interested in fighting terrorists than in adhering to the rules and making rank. The investigation of his case revealed fissures in the polished image of the SEALs and the unwritten code of silence among members of the secretive force, who see themselves as a brotherhood.
