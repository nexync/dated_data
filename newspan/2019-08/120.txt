TORONTO — Gio Urshela hit two home runs for the second straight game, and the Yankees outslugged the rookie Bo Bichette and the Toronto Blue Jays, 12-6, on Thursday night to extend their winning streak to a season-best nine games.
Playing in Toronto for the first time, Bichette became the first player in major league history to double in nine consecutive games. He also homered, giving him an unprecedented 13 extra-base hits in his first 11 career games. Bichette is the first rookie to have an extra-base hit in nine straight games since Ted Williams in 1939, according to Stats L.L.C.
The Yankees have hit a record 19 homers over their past four games, including at least five in each win during a three-game sweep at Baltimore this week. Mike Tauchman also homered on Thursday, giving the Yankees three long balls in the series opener against the Blue Jays.
The Yankees have homered in 12 consecutive games, hitting two or more in a season-high seven straight. They are an American League-best 51-7 when hitting two or more homers this season.
Domingo German (15-2) pitched five innings to win his sixth consecutive decision. He allowed four runs (three earned) and eight hits, improving to 9-0 against A.L. East opponents. He is unbeaten since June 7 at Cleveland.
The Yankees improved to 76-39 and lead the A.L. East by 10½ games for the first time since September 2009.
Urshela hit two-run homers in the first and third innings. Tauchman also had a two-run shot during the six-run third.
Both of Urshela’s homers came off the left-hander Thomas Pannone (2-5), who matched a career worst by giving up seven runs in two and a third innings.
Chad Green worked the sixth, and Luis Cessa pitched the final three innings for his first save.
Blue Jays catcher Reese McGuire had a career-high four hits, including a solo homer off Cessa in the eighth.
