The government was forced to borrow $77 billion from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union, and impose austerity measures on its people. American investment banks bought up mortgage loans at a discount, profiting as the market recovered.
Home prices have rebounded since the recession, but homeownership has not, in part because people paying high rents often cannot save for down payments. To curb dangerous lending and borrowing, the Central Bank of Ireland in 2015 capped mortgage loans at about 3.5 times the buyerâ€™s annual income, but the median price is about 5.6 times earnings.
To bridge the gap, there is an increasing clamor for the center-right government of Prime Minister Leo Varadkar to build publicly owned housing. Critics also question policies like offering tax incentives to big corporate landlords and relying heavily on rent subsidies paid to private owners.
