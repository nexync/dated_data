The editor of The New Orleans Advocate discusses its purchase of The Times-Picayune.
I was honored to work as a colleague of Mr. Elie at The Times-Picayune in New Orleans, so it was disappointing to see his comments about his former employer. The Times-Picayune has not “suffered its own passing” and was not “practically buried” with its sale to a rival newspaper, The New Orleans Advocate.
Local owners in May purchased The Times-Picayune from a family in New York. The Los Angeles Times was also recently purchased by a local owner, and readers have benefited from the move. The same thing is happening in New Orleans.
In 2012, Advance Publications laid off 200 Times-Picayune employees and ended daily publication of a cherished newspaper, defying the will of a community still recovering from Hurricane Katrina. Locals called the new three-day-a-week publication The Some-Times Picayune.
The locally owned New Orleans Advocate stepped in to keep alive daily print coverage and the brand of fearless investigative journalism New Orleans valued, and needed. The Advocate’s editor and publisher, and many of its top staff members, were Times-Picayune veterans. For six years, two teams of Times-Picayune veterans fought for scoops and subscribers, ad sales and eyeballs.
When Advance capitulated and sold the newspaper in May, The New Orleans Advocate newsroom had a higher percentage of Times-Picayune veterans from the pre-2012 era than The Times-Picayune.
The purchase did not mean that The Times-Picayune is “gone.” It came back as a daily newspaper. The community has embraced the change.
