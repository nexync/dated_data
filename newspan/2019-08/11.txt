Reds rookie Aristides Aquino homered in his first three at-bats against the Cubs on Saturday night, then drew a four-pitch walk and struck out in his last two plate appearances.
The 39,866 fans were on their feet at Great American Ball Park when Aquino came to bat in the sixth inning, trying for a record-tying fourth home run. Alec Mills walked him on four pitches that were nowhere close, throwing a breaking ball on a 3-0 count, and drawing boos from the crowd. Mills fanned Aquino in the seventh inning on a breaking ball that was well below the strike zone. The Reds won the game, 10-1.
There have been 18 players who hit four homers in a game, most recently J.D. Martinez for Arizona on Sept. 4, 2017. Scooter Gennett homered four times for the Reds in Cincinnati on June 6, 2017.
