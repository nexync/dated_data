Forget pricey tours. For the cost of a one-way commuter fare, sublime views can be had in some of the world’s most picturesque cities.
Across the world in Venice, simply board a vaporetto, one of the water buses that serve as the main form of public transport, and marvel at gothic palaces that hark back to the city’s 14th- and 15th-century grandeur. A 24-hour travel card costs €20, which might seem steep but is worth it if you plan more than two trips.
