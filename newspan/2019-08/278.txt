A star-studded documentary about gender inequality in film and TV is equal parts history lesson and constructive criticism.
As the actress and activist Geena Davis puts it in “This Changes Everything,” a new documentary about Hollywood’s pervasive gender inequalities, each of those highly successful films with female leads (and in some cases, female filmmakers) had been expected to expand the opportunities for women, or so the media narrative went with each release.
It takes a bit of time for the documentary to find its groove. Channeling the hurried nature of a TV docuseries edited to cover an extremely broad topic in a limited amount of time, the first act layers a lot of too-brief sound bites — albeit from an impressive array of influential women, including Reese Witherspoon and Shonda Rhimes — over movie clips emphasizing the prevalence of machismo and misogyny (“The Godfather,” for example) to almost dizzying effect.
Once it finally begins to focus on the mission, however, “This Changes Everything” not only becomes engrossing but reveals itself as a crucial cri de coeur. Most fascinating is an examination of the six women who in 1979 founded the Directors Guild of America’s Women’s Steering Committee, which sought to investigate the hiring practices of studios. All but one of the women were interviewed for this film, and Donahue takes his time to carefully lay out the details and takeaways of their efforts (which led the D.G.A. to unsuccessfully sue Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures for discrimination).
I fear the message may continue to elude those who need to hear it the most. Even though Landgraf and several prominent men are interviewed, a title card notes that the studio heads the filmmakers reached out to declined to appear in the film. For the rest of us, “This Changes Everything” will frustrate, enrage and maybe even inspire.
