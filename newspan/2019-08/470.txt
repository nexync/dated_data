In Catherine Chung’s THE TENTH MUSE, Katherine is a Chinese-American girl in 1950s Michigan with a standout talent for math. One day, her mother leaves without explanation. As an adult, Katherine pursues two mysteries: her family lineage, and a famous math problem that leads her to a Ph.D. and beyond. Both quests take her to postwar Germany as the novel tackles questions of identity, betrayal, ambition and loneliness, charting the mathematician’s efforts to make her mark in a male-dominated field and be taken seriously while dating a celebrated professor.
Historical details animate the story, from Katherine’s childhood fixation with Laika, the Soviet space dog, to her admiration for women like Emmy Noether, the mathematician who made major contributions to physics and fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s.
Number games and logic puzzles are embedded throughout, offering something distinctive in an absorbing summer read.
