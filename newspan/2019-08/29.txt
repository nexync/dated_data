THE MERE WIFE, by Maria Dahvana Headley. (MCD/Picador, $18.) This fierce modern retelling of “Beowulf,” filled with contemporary versions of the ancient epic’s monsters and heroes, pits a traumatized former soldier and her unusual son against the grasping denizens of an upscale gated community. Our reviewer, Michael Upchurch, praised Headley’s “stark, lacerating, insightful” prose.
UPSTATE, by James Wood. (Picador, $17.) This sensitive novel by the eminent New Yorker literary critic tells of a family that has edged into crisis as the older of two daughters falls into a debilitating depression. A trip to upstate New York to console her becomes a chance to reconsider old patterns and probe deeper questions about the quicksilver nature of emotional suffering and the eternal quest to find meaning in life’s struggles.
HOW TO LOVE A JAMAICAN: Stories, by Alexia Arthurs. (Ballantine, $17.) Many of the stories in this accomplished debut collection about Jamaican immigrants take place in New York City and Midwest university towns, but Arthurs’s characters are haunted by memories of Jamaica and unfinished family business there. The thoughtful, yearning voices — women and men, younger and older — add up to a complex cultural portrait.
