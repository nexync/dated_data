One way to demonstrate the power of dance? A ballet class. “We are such a loving, accepting community,” Robbie Fairchild said.
On Monday morning, a strange sight overtook Times Square: A ballet class.
At about 7 a.m., around 300 dancers — boys and girls, men and women — took turns glissading across the concrete at 44th Street and Seventh Avenue, which was transformed into a scene from “Fame.” Piles of dance bags formed mountains. Supporters held signs with messages like “#metutu,” “Boys Dance Too” and “I Wish I’d Started at 6!!!” It wasn’t confrontational, but it did make a statement.
The class was a response to Thursday’s “Good Morning America,” on which Lara Spencer, a host, laughed at the news that Prince George was planning to study ballet. “We’ll see how long that lasts,” she said. On Monday, she apologized for her remarks.
Mr. Wall said that after watching the segment, “I was horrified thinking about little boys hearing the laughter.” But he was open to talking with Ms. Spencer.
The Times Square class, near ABC’s studios, where “Good Morning America” is broadcast, was organized by two Broadway dancers, Charlie Williams and Sam Quinn. It was a way to show younger dancers not just the power of the dance community, but the power of dance. Helping to guide the participants through pliés, pirouettes and, yes, even jumps on concrete, were Mr. Wall and Robbie Fairchild, a former principal dancer at New York City Ballet who went on to star in “An American in Paris” on Broadway.
Mr. Fairchild said that looking out to see all the young dancers open their arms at the same time was incredible.
