The Mobile Police Department said the Lakers center will be charged with misdemeanor domestic violence.
An arrest warrant for the Los Angeles Lakers center DeMarcus Cousins was issued Thursday in Mobile, Ala., for a misdemeanor charge of domestic violence, a Mobile police spokeswoman confirmed. A court also granted Christy West a protective order, forbidding Cousins from contacting her.
Earlier this week, West, who identified herself as having once had a relationship with Cousins, filed papers in Mobile County Court accusing Cousins of threatening to shoot her. The paperwork also included an accusation that Cousins had choked her in the past. West requested that the court issue a restraining order against Cousins forbidding contact with her or their 7-year-old child.
According to the court filing, on Aug. 23 — the day before Cousins was to get married to another woman — Cousins used an expletive and said that he would shoot West in the head “even if he didn’t have to get his hands dirty doing it.” The news website TMZ published what it said was a phone call with Cousins making the threat to West because of a dispute over whether their son would be at the wedding.
Cousins is being charged with third-degree harassing communication, according to the Mobile municipal court website. The offense is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail. USA Today first reported that an arrest warrant had been issued.
West and representatives for Cousins were not immediately available for comment. Press officers for the N.B.A. and the Lakers referred to their statements after the allegations first surfaced, which said they were investigating.
Cousins, who signed with the Lakers this summer, likely will not play this season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee earlier this month, the latest in a string of injuries that have hampered his career.
