MACEIÓ, Brazil — We traveled to Brazil this spring for many reasons, but one of them was to try to solve a mystery that had been bothering us for months.
Conventional wisdom has said that WhatsApp, a popular messaging service owned by Facebook, played a major and potentially decisive role in circulating false information that drove Brazilians toward the long-shot, far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro.
But the more we looked, the harder it became to square this with what we knew about social media and what we were finding in Brazil.
For one thing, WhatsApp is just a user-driven messaging service. Unlike open and algorithm-driven platforms like Facebook, it serves as more of a passive vector for pre-existing extremism or conspiracism than a generator of those things. This sentiment and material was coming from somewhere else.
For another, the more we looked at the rise of Brazil’s far right, the more we encountered stories of radicalization and misinformation that centered not on WhatsApp but on YouTube, which even many far-right politicians cite as a deciding factor in their elections.
We landed in Brazil hoping to unravel this seeming mystery. What had really happened there, why were so many observers crediting it to WhatsApp and what did it mean about the power of social media to distort or upend democracies worldwide?
Everything began to click into place when we met Luciana Brito, a soft-spoken clinical psychologist who works with families affected by the Zika virus.
Her work had put her on the front lines of the struggle against conspiracy theories, threats and hatred swirling on both platforms. And it allowed her to see what we — like so many observers — had missed: that WhatsApp and YouTube had come to form a powerful, and at times dangerous, feedback loop of extremism and misinformation.
Either platform had plenty of weaknesses on its own. But, together, they had formed a pipeline of misinformation, spreading conspiracy theories, campaign material and political propaganda throughout Brazil.
Farshad Shadloo, a YouTube spokesman, said the company had concluded that 1 percent of its videos constituted “harmful misinformation” or other forms of “borderline” content. The company has seen viewership of news channels grow in Brazil, he added. Mr. Shadloo cast doubt on reports of WhatsApp communities amplifying messages that had first gone viral on YouTube.
The first breakthrough came when we spoke to Yasodara Cordova, who at the time was a researcher at Harvard’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society.
Illiteracy remains widespread in some parts of Brazil, she said, ruling out text-based social media or news sources for many people. And TV networks can be low-quality, which has helped drive YouTube’s stunning growth in many parts of Brazil, particularly on mobile.
But YouTube has had less success in poorer regions of Brazil for one simple reason: Users cannot afford the cellphone data.
WhatsApp has become a workaround. The messaging app has a deal with some carriers to offer free data on the app, and poorer users found that this offered them a way around YouTube’s unaffordability. They would share snippets of YouTube videos that they found on WhatsApp, where the videos can be watched and shared for free.
Ms. Cordova suspected that the WhatsApp-spread misinformation had often come from videos that first went viral on YouTube, where they had been boosted by the extremism-favoring algorithms that we documented in our story earlier this week.
YouTube users then pushed clips of those videos to WhatsApp, whose users would have seen their news diets on the messaging service suddenly shaped by whatever YouTube’s algorithms happened to boost. It was like an infection jumping from one host to the next.
And those WhatsApp users could share the video clips but, because open internet access might be too expensive, or because of illiteracy, were not always in a position to check the videos’ veracity or to seek out alternate points of view.
Could this really be happening at a wide enough scale to impact Brazilian politics? Before heading to Brazil to investigate, we asked Virgilio Almeida, a computer scientist at the Federal University of Minas Gerais who, along with a team of student researchers, has been studying far-right content on YouTube and WhatsApp: What did the evidence show?
Mr. Almeida and his team tracked tens of thousands of messages in hundreds of Brazilian WhatsApp groups to look for trends that might shed light on the question.
The team found that users in these groups uploaded one video for every 14 text messages, an astonishingly high rate.
Though the researchers could not be sure how many of the videos came from YouTube, they found that the WhatsApp users linked to YouTube more than any other site — 10 times as frequently as they linked to Facebook — bolstering the theory of a YouTube-to-WhatsApp pipeline.
Together, the two data points suggested that YouTube clips may be reaching enormous audiences on WhatsApp in Brazil — particularly among poorer and illiterate Brazilians who, to the surprise of many observers, shifted toward Mr. Bolsonaro in the recent election.
A spokesman for WhatsApp said that public groups account for a small fraction of WhatsApp conversations and so may not be representative. Internal company data, he said, indicates that most Brazilians share videos at a lower rate than the users whom Mr. Almeida followed. The groups that Mr. Almeida’s team examined may not be representative.
The spokesman added that the company is committed to limiting the spread of misinformation, by setting policies, for example, that restrict how widely messages can be forwarded.
Mr. Shadloo, the YouTube spokesman, said that only 1 percent of YouTube’s web traffic in Brazil came through WhatsApp. This number would not reflect clips that are re-uploaded to WhatsApp as raw video files — a common practice in the country, according to researchers and activists there.
By the time we arrived in Brazil, we were eager to understand whether this was really happening at rates as high as Mr. Almeida’s research had suggested. And we wanted to know whether, like on YouTube itself, the videos that went viral on WhatsApp tended to inflate the reach of extremism and conspiracy theories.
In Maceió, a city in Brazil’s northeast that was among the hardest hit by the 2015 Zika virus outbreak, we saw the pipeline in action. On our second night in town, we spoke with Dr. Brito, the psychologist who works with Zika-affected families.
That day, we had watched Dr. Brito meet with a group of local mothers with Zika and try her best to swat back dangerous rumors that blamed the disease on vaccines or international conspiracies — and that the mothers repeatedly said they had encountered on YouTube or WhatsApp.
It was nearly midnight by the time she sat down to speak with us. She was exhausted after a day so busy that she didn’t eat lunch until after 9 p.m., and had a splitting headache. But she had something important that she wanted to show us.
Scrolling through her phone, Dr. Brito pulled up a WhatsApp message she had received from a father of a child with microcephaly, a condition caused by Zika. It contained a clip, cut from a YouTube video, claiming that Zika had been spread by the Rockefeller Foundation as part of a conspiracy to legalize abortion in Brazil. The father demanded to know if it was true.
This had become a common occurrence, she said.
The videos often spread in WhatsApp chat groups that had been set up to share information and news about coping with Zika, turning users’ efforts to take control of their families’ health against them.
“The first thing they do is to pick up their phone, and go on WhatsApp to ask other mothers, and exchange information that way,” said Auriene Oliviera, an infectious disease specialist in Maceió.
“The mothers organize themselves on WhatsApp,” she added, so misinformation had proven especially viral there.
Dr. Brito and her colleagues participated in WhatsApp groups and tried to debunk the theories, but the questions kept coming.
The consequences could be severe, not just for the doubt-stricken families, but also for Dr. Brito and her colleagues.
Right-wing YouTubers had hijacked already-viral Zika conspiracies, and added a twist: Womens’ rights groups, they claimed, had helped engineer the virus as an excuse to impose mandatory abortions.
In this way, the YouTubers redirected viewers’ fear into rage, which they wielded against favorite targets — like Dr. Brito’s group, which had advocated for exceptions to Brazil’s abortion ban for mothers with Zika.
“Right after they launch a video, we start receiving threats,” she said.
Threats had grown so frequent that the police set up a special channel for her and her colleagues to report them. Dr. Brito said her organization did not want to overwhelm the police, so they filed reports only when they received threats that were especially serious — approximately once a week, she estimated.
Even some mothers had grown skeptical of the rights groups seeking to help them.
“These women are very vulnerable. And when the state is absent, and public policies are absent, then it’s very easy for them to fall into the trap of believing in these theories,” Dr. Brito said.
Meeting the users who had misinformation served to them on the YouTube-to-WhatsApp pipeline made clear just how outmatched regular people can be against these platforms.
Three years ago, when her second child was given a diagnosis of microcephaly, information was scarce. So she sought out every scrap she could, including on YouTube.
Again and again, it served her videos attributing Zika to bad vaccines or international conspiracies. Other mothers had the same experience, and they shared their findings on group text messages.
Some of the YouTube videos had been staged to resemble news reports or advice from health workers. The recommendation systems are still promoting them, the Harvard analysis found, recommending them alongside more reputable medical advice and surfacing them as top search results.
A spokesman for YouTube confirmed the findings, calling the results unintended, and said the company would change how its search tool surfaced videos related to Zika.
Ms. Oliveira dos Santos knew that the internet could be unreliable. And she believed in vaccines: She knew that they could protect children from serious diseases. But after watching the videos, she felt paralyzed by doubt.
Though she gave her child standard childhood vaccines, she said, “I was scared to give any more vaccines to my daughter after that.” She and her mother have both stopped taking vaccines as well.
That wasn’t the only issue on which YouTube altered her thinking.
She had not initially been a supporter of Mr. Bolsonaro, she said. But friends of hers kept sending her videos about him. So she turned to YouTube to find out more.
In October, she voted for him.
