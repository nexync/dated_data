The director David Leitch discusses his split-screen introduction of the film’s title characters, played by Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham.
The director David Leitch narrates a sequence from “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,” featuring Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham.
Before the world-saving, before the explosions, before the zany car chases, please allow them to introduce themselves.
The characters of Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham) are probably familiar if you’ve been keeping up with the long-running “Fast & Furious” franchise. But here, the director David Leitch comes up with a fun way to induct them into their first spinoff feature. It’s a split-screen not-yet-meet-cute that shows their very different lifestyle and action-style approaches, while also suggesting that deep down, they’re the same.
Narrating this scene, Leitch describes how he and his team worked to compose side-by-side shots that place them in the same spots within their frames. He also discusses giving them each their own action-hero catchphrases to deliver before going to town on a group of baddies.
