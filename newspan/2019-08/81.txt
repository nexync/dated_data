Tosca Cafe, in the city’s North Beach neighborhood, is the latest casualty of the meltdown of the pair’s restaurant group, which at its peak in 2017 encompassed seven restaurants in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
In December of 2017, a report in The New York Times revealed a pattern of verbal abuse and sexual harassment at the restaurants they owned and ran together. While Mr. Friedman’s aggressions were singled out by 10 women who had worked for them, Ms. Bloomfield was also accused of doing little to protect the victims. Mr. Friedman issued an apologetic statement and stepped away from daily operations, and the empire was ultimately dissolved in June of 2018. Months later, Ms. Bloomfield spoke publicly about the accusations for the first time, in an interview that addressed her own responsibilities and regrets.
In the separation, Mr. Friedman gained sole control of the Spotted Pig, the pair’s flagship restaurant in Manhattan’s West Village, and the place where Ms. Bloomfield made her name as a chef when it opened in 2004.
But Hearth & Hound closed in January, the John Dory closed in February (to be replaced by a marquee Milk Bar store from the chef Christina Tosi) and Ms. Bloomfield’s version of Tosca served its last meal on Saturday night.
Ms. Bloomfield has come full circle: She moved back to New York from California and now has just one restaurant, as she did when she arrived from England to create the original menu for the Spotted Pig.
