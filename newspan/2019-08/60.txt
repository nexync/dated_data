Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater.
‘AMERICAN MOOR’ at the Cherry Lane Theater (previews start on Aug. 27; opens on Sept. 8). An actor playing Othello is disagreeing with the show’s director. The director asks if the actor is playing the race card. “Othello,” the actor argues, is “the race deck.” In Keith Hamilton Cobb’s play, produced by Red Bull Theater and directed by Kim Weild, a man reckons with Shakespeare and with race in America.
‘FELIX STARRO’ at Theater Row (previews start on Aug. 23; opens on Sept. 3). In this new musical by Jessica Hagedorn and Fabian Obispo for Ma-Yi Theater Company, a Filipino healer arrives in San Francisco and performs a series of dubious psychic surgeries. But his grandson may not have faith. Alan Ariano stars; Ralph B. Peña directs.
‘SINCERITY FOREVER’ AND ‘BAD PENNY’ at the Flea Theater (previews start on Aug. 24; opens on Sept. 7). A sui generis playwright and an influential mentor, Mac Wellman has inspired a festival at the Flea Theater, which begins with two early works. Dina Vovsi directs “Sincerity Forever,” a play about white supremacist teens menaced by fur balls. Kristan Seemel directs “Bad Penny,” an aphoristic, existential comedy set in Central Park.
‘WIVES’ at Playwrights Horizons (previews start on Aug. 23; opens on Sept. 16). Is Jaclyn Backhaus’s new play one to love, honor and cherish? Directed by Margot Bordelon for Playwrights Horizons, the piece, which spans three places and three eras, explores how behind every great and not-so-great man, there is a largely ignored woman. Aadya Bedi, Purva Bedi and Adina Verson star.
