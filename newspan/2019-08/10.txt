ROME — Maiken Offerdal of Norway and her teenage sons were just sitting down on Rome’s famed Spanish Steps on Wednesday when they heard two shrieks of a whistle.
Penalties for graffiti were toughened, as were those for the off-hour sale of alcohol. The new regulations also tighten enforcement of the prostitution laws and the mistreatment of animals, among other things.
Dozens of startled people, most of them presumably tourists, were reprimanded on a broiling Wednesday afternoon by a small force of municipal police officers — this reporter counted at least eight — who admonished step-sitters by blowing twice on their whistles and gesturing stiffly to stand up.
A tired-looking father with a stroller in his hands and a toddler on his shoulders, was coming down the steps when he was stopped by a cry of “Hey Mister.” The stroller, an officer said, cannot touch the steps. The father grudgingly complied.
The Spanish Steps — 174 of them — were built in the 18th century. With the Santissima Trinità dei Monti Church presiding majestically at the top, they are one of Rome’s most popular tourist attractions. On Wednesday afternoon, a few hundred tourists snapped photos of their families and friends with the steps as a backdrop.
The steps are in excellent shape. Three years ago, Bulgari, the luxury brand, paid for a €1.5 million, 10-month spruce-up.
The Rome newspaper Il Messaggero said Wednesday that photographs of empty stairs “were not an image of strength, but of desolation.” The newspaper accused the mayor of trying to apply “Swiss rigor” to what was a quintessentially Roman spot for relaxation.
Like many Italian cities, Rome is an open-air museum that asks little of its visitors except civility, said David Sermoneta, the president of the Piazza di Spagna Trinità dei Monti Association.
