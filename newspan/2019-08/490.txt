Seven years after “Linsanity,” the Asian-American trailblazer will play for the Beijing Shougang Ducks, the team announced.
There was a chilly N.B.A. free agency market for Lin, 31, who split last season between the Atlanta Hawks and Toronto Raptors. He played only 27 minutes for the Raptors in the playoffs, including just one mop-up minute in the finals.
Lin got spare backup minutes for the Golden State Warriors in 2010-11, but his Linsanity run for the Knicks in 2012 lifted him from obscure bench player to genuine international star. He signed a four-year, $28.8 million contract with the Rockets the next summer, and he has also played for the Los Angeles Lakers, the Charlotte Hornets and the Brooklyn Nets.
