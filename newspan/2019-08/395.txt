The week before Swift’s “Lover” ranks on the Billboard 200, it has already become the year’s top-selling album.
The release of a new album by Taylor Swift — whose “Lover” came out on Friday — practically serves as a memo to all other artists with records on the way: Get your album out before hers, or abandon any hope of reaching No. 1.
This week, the top three spots on Billboard’s album chart are new releases. The Atlanta rapper Young Thug reached No. 1 for the first time with “So Much Fun,” followed by the latest from Lionel Richie and a compilation playlist from the hip-hop label Quality Control Music. Come next week, they will all surely sit at least one rung lower.
Young Thug’s “So Much Fun” (300/Atlantic) reached the top almost entirely through streaming. According to Nielsen, songs from that album were played almost 168 million times in the United States last week, though the full album sold fewer than 5,000 copies.
In third place is “Control the Streets, Volume 2,” a 36-track playlist from the Atlanta hip-hop label Quality Control Music, featuring artists from its roster, including Migos, Lil Yachty, Lil Baby and Quavo, along with guests like Gucci Mane, Travis Scott and Young Thug. It was streamed 82.6 million times last week, while just over 1,000 copies were sold as a complete package, giving the full collection the equivalent of 64,000 sales.
Also this week, Billie Eilish’s “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” holds at No. 4 and Ed Sheeran’s “No.6 Collaborations Project” stays at No. 5.
Swift’s “Lover,” meanwhile, already became the year’s top-selling album — after just two days on sale. The music industry is now watching closely to see if the LP can reach a million sales in its first week.
