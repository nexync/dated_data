The death of Eric Garner remains a deep and lingering wound in our communities. But we are at a point in time when all of our diverse communities can and should acknowledge the hard work and good-faith efforts of the men and women in our police department to keep us safe while treating us with respect and fairness.
We ask police officers to put their lives on the line for our communities every day. We demand that they serve and protect us all. In exchange, we should show the N.Y.P.D. respect when its officers are lawfully doing exactly what we have asked them to do.
