The revival of Terrence McNally’s play is wrapping up a month earlier than expected.
“Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,” Terrence McNally’s two-hander about wounded romantics in a one-night stand, will close on July 28, producers announced on Monday.
Despite featuring the six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald and the two-time Oscar nominee Michael Shannon in the title roles, the show will close nearly a month earlier than planned. After opening May 30 as the first production of the 2019-20 season, it will have played 70 performances and 26 previews.
The box office wasn’t as good. For the week ending July 7, the production was the lowest grossing on Broadway, earning $231,745, just 20 percent of its potential take. The show was capitalized for up to $4.1 million, according to securities documents, costs it will not recoup.
“Frankie and Johnny” had its Off Broadway premiere in 1987, and was presented on Broadway for the first time in 2002, with Stanley Tucci and Edie Falco, running for more than 200 performances.
While this rendition’s run will be brief, it has made Broadway history as the first show to use an “intimacy director” to help stage sex scenes and nudity.
Claire Warden handled that task, working with the actors and the director Arin Arbus, making her own Broadway debut.
