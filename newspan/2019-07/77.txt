Farnsworth House sits far inland, but the techniques used to save it may one day be applied to historic homes threatened by rising seas.
Perhaps the most unusual project to protect an important building from rising water involves a structure far from the coast: Farnsworth House, a glass-walled midcentury gem in Plano, Ill.
The house was designed and built in 1951 by the modernist pioneer Ludwig Mies van der Rohe on a site near — but, it was thought, not too near — the Fox River. In recent years, however, the house has been repeatedly threatened by river floods, and so the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which owns it, commissioned the Boston engineering firm Silman to design a solution.
In a preliminary report presented to the trust in 2015, the team described the approaches it had considered but rejected.
The team also considered putting some kind of balloon device under the house, or constructing an inflatable barrier around it. But those devices would not necessarily defend the structure against rushing water or debris, Mr. Rosenberg said.
The house will have to be moved off site while the apparatus is built, but once it is back in place, “no one knows the difference,” he said. The hydraulic mechanism would be hidden underground, except when it operates to lift the house above water.
