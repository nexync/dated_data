North Korea revealed the news of its new submarine on the same day that John R. Bolton, the White House’s national security adviser, was to arrive in Seoul, the South Korean capital, to discuss North Korea and a festering trade dispute between South Korea and Japan, both American allies. Mr. Bolton met with Japanese officials in Tokyo on Monday.
President Trump and Mr. Kim met on the border that divides the two Koreas last month and agreed to resume staff-level talks between the two countries, months after the leaders’ second summit meeting in Hanoi, Vietnam, ended with no agreement on ending the North’s nuclear program. But such lower-level talks have yet to take place.
But the subsequent appearance of the new submarine could complicate efforts to restart the talks, since it raises questions of whether North Korea’s submarine fleet can launch nuclear missiles, said Srinivasan Sitaraman, a North Korea expert at Clark University in Massachusetts.
“Pictures of Kim Jong-un posing next to a large submarine with a displacement capacity of over 2,000 tons and capable of launching nuclear missiles suggests that it would be nearly impossible” to account for the North’s nuclear capabilities, he said.
