Theater|The ‘Les Misérables’ Revolving Stage Is Going. Fans Are in a Spin.
The original London production is closing this month after a 33-year run. When it returns, a well-loved feature won’t be there.
The musical, set in early-19th-century France, would reopen in December after a series of concert performances, Mr. Mackintosh added. But it would no longer be the well-loved original production featuring a revolving stage that spins as the actors sing, giving endless movement to the production and transporting viewers from the French countryside to the sewers of Paris in an instant.
“Les Miz was and is a great show, but it also takes a very creative impresario to keep a show like Les Miz running for so long,” he added.
