A long legacy of sexism in sports.
The American women won their fourth World Cup yesterday, and if you haven’t seen Rose Lavelle’s goal yet, I recommend taking a minute to watch it.
U.S. Soccer has defended the disparities by arguing that the men’s team brings in more revenue. But there are two holes in that argument.
Second, female athletes have suffered decades — centuries, really — of discrimination. Until the 1970s, high schools and colleges fielded few female teams, and those teams received far fewer resources. Girls who wanted to play sports were often told — by their parents, teachers and friends — that it wasn’t their place to do so. And while this discrimination has receded, it certainly has not disappeared.
Given this legacy, the right thing for U.S. Soccer to do is to fix the disparity in pay and other resources. Even though the men’s team has bought in more revenue historically, the men and women haven’t been competing on a level playing field, as the saying goes. One of the reasons that women’s sports have received less attention and brought in less money is the long history of discrimination.
Instead of righting that historical wrong, U.S. Soccer is perpetuating it.
The women’s World Cup team is “the most American thing we’ve got going right now,” Lauren Peace writes today in The Times.
If you just want to read more about yesterday’s match, try The Ringer, Sports Illustrated or The Times. The American men’s team also had a match yesterday; it lost to Mexico, 1-0, in a regional championship.
