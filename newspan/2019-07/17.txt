Yifei Liu springs into action in the clip, which features plenty of adventure, but no songs.

The clip debuted during halftime of the Women’s World Cup soccer final, an apt choice for this story of female empowerment. Mulan (the Chinese actress Liu Yifei) is initially told by her parents (Rosalind Chao and Tzi Ma) that a match has been found for her to enter an arranged marriage. But her destiny lies elsewhere, as Mulan trains to become a warrior — riding horses, shooting arrows and fighting with swords.
Directed by Niki Caro (“The Zookeeper’s Wife”), this “Mulan” seems to have a dramatically different tone than its animated predecessor. There are no musical numbers in the trailer, nor is there any sign of the talking dragon, Mushu, who was voiced by Eddie Murphy in the cartoon. The teaser also plays down the idea that Mulan must dress as a man to join the Imperial Army and fight attackers invading China.
With a cast that also includes Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Gong Li and Jason Scott Lee, “Mulan” will reach theaters on March 27, 2020.
