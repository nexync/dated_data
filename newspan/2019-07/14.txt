Hannah Brown reaches the final rose on “The Bachelorette” season finale. And Cummings tackles sexual harassment in her latest stand-up special.
THE BACHELORETTE 8 p.m. on ABC. The 15th season of this reality dating show may be remembered more for a relationship that didn’t work out than for the one the bachelorette, Hannah Brown, ultimately chooses. Earlier this season, as Brown was deciding between her final four suitors, one of them, Luke, questioned her faith and morality while telling her that he’d want to leave the show if she had been intimate with any other contestants.  In the second night of this two-part finale, Brown could end up engaged to one of the final two contestants, but her resounding refusal to be judged may outshine any televised proposal.
60 DAYS IN: NARCOLAND 10 p.m. on A&E.

In “Narcoland,” six participants will embed with law enforcement officers and spend time in local jails to see how drug trafficking is affecting communities along Interstate Highway 65, which runs through Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana.
