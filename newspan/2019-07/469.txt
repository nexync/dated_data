From poetic and political imagery in the Bronx to dancers swimming and playing tennis onstage at Lincoln Center, here’s a guide to some of what’s on offer around the city.
The Bronx Documentary Center’s second annual Latin American Foto Festival is highlighting the work of 10 photographers from eight Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. “Most of the artists are working on intimate stories about social issues using innovative visual approaches that stretch the boundaries of traditional documentary photography,” James Estrin wrote in his feature about the festival, which also includes panel discussions and workshops.

The Classical Theater of Harlem’s new production of “The Bacchae” is “totally exhilarating” and “will leave you wanting to join the chorus,” Jose Solís wrote in his review. Bonus: It’s completely free. In Bryan Doerries’s adaptation of the Euripides play, the deity Dionysus takes human form as the charismatic Preacher D, who has come to wreak havoc on those who refuse to acknowledge his godliness. Through July 28; cthnyc.org.
“A drama is unfolding with a cast of some 50 awesome players,” Holland Cotter wrote in his review of this sculpture exhibition at the Met Breuer. He called Mrinalini Mukherjee’s contemporary sculpture “an astonishment” that made him wonder “How on earth did someone even think to do this, never mind do it?” Simply put: See this show now. Through Sept. 29; metmuseum.org.
Dancers swimming, fishing, golfing and playing tennis? Mark Morris has delivered another one of his “droll pantomime pieces,” Brian Seibert wrote in his review of “Sport,” which had its world premiere on Wednesday at the Mostly Mozart Festival. Set to piano pieces by Erik Satie, the dance is a light, witty opener to a strong program by the Mark Morris Dance Group that includes the masterpieces “V” and “Empire Garden.” Through July 13; mostlymozartfestival.org.
