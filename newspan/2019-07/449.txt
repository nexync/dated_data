Do Lox and Other Smoked Fish Increase Cancer Risk?
She notes that the processing itself appears to be the underlying issue when it comes to cancer risk. As with meat products, salmon and other types of fish are often smoked or cured to enhance flavor and preservation. Lox, for instance, is salt-cured, or brined. Cold-smoked salmon is also brined but then smoked at a very low temperature.
Other processing methods may also play a role. The high temperatures used in some smoking techniques could be a risk factor, as high heat has been linked to formation of cancerous substances when cooking meat. So could the nitrates used as preservatives. Or, it could be a combination of factors.
