WASHINGTON — The C.I.A. is quietly pushing Congress to significantly expand the scope of a law that makes it a crime to disclose the identities of undercover intelligence agents, raising alarms among advocates of press freedoms.
Lawmakers have attached the C.I.A.’s proposed language to defense and intelligence bills moving through Congress. The provisions have sparked objections among press freedom and government transparency advocates. Potential amendments to the House intelligence bill must be submitted by Thursday to be considered when it comes to the House floor.
It is possible that the law needs to be updated because of technological advances since 1982, like the arrival of the internet, said Steve Aftergood, a government secrecy specialist for the Federation of American Scientists. But he portrayed the legislative push as premature.
But in its justification to Congress, the C.I.A. wrote that changes since 1982, including “cyber threats,” meant Congress’s rationale for limiting protections to overseas agents was obsolete.
“Thirty-seven years later, the threats undercover agency officers face are evolving and are no longer limited to those officers who are serving abroad or have done so recently,” the C.I.A. wrote.
