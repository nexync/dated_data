The police said he left the infants in the heat on Friday and worked a full shift at a hospital in the Bronx.
The father of 1-year-old twins who died Friday after the police said he had left them in a hot car was charged with manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.
The father, Juan Rodriguez, 39, of New City, N.Y., was arrested and charged late on Friday, the police said. He left the children inside a parked silver Honda Accord in the morning in the Bronx and reported for his job at the James J. Peters V.A. Medical Center, officials said.
It was unclear why he had left the babies, a boy and a girl, alone in the car. Hours later, Mr. Rodriguez left his job, got in the car and drove a short distance before realizing they were inside, the police said. He jumped out and screamed.
A passer-by called the police. When officers arrived, they discovered that the infants, identified as Mariza and Phoenix Rodriguez, were both dead.
In New City in Rockland County, about an hour north of New York City, neighbors said they found the circumstances surrounding the infants’ deaths incomprehensible and difficult to square with their knowledge of Mr. Rodriguez as a caring father.
They recalled the family celebrating a birthday party this month that had included balloons, tents, fireworks and an inflatable bouncing house. Neighbors described the Rodriguez family as attentive to their children.
The Rodriguez family home, a two-story brown house, has a large fenced backyard with a set of swings and three yellow slides. A sign that says “Slow Down Look Up” was staked in the grass beside the mailbox.
It was not immediately clear on Saturday if Mr. Rodriguez had a lawyer. No one answered at the home.
Each year, an average of 38 children die of heatstroke after being left in locked cars, according to kidsandcars.org, a nonprofit focused on preventing death and injury to children and pets from vehicles.
The organization’s website listed 21 deaths this year, as of July 16.
