Late in 2018, an online spreadsheet of men in the media accused of sexual harassment became public, sparking a media firestorm.
According to Chandler Baker, whose novel “Whisper Network” enters the list this week at No. 12, that kind of list is nothing new. “Women have been working to protect other women for ages,” says Baker, who also works as a corporate attorney. “I often think about the women at Brown University who, back in the 1990s, created a list on the bathroom wall of the library” of the men who had sexually assaulted them or someone they knew.
That’s what happens in “Whisper Network,” which follows a group of women at a Dallas corporation who mobilize when a known sexual harasser is about to waltz into the C.E.O. slot.
