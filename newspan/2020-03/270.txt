Many curators had projects they considered feminist already in the works, and they sometimes shifted scheduling to align with the initiative’s fall timing. At least 20 exhibitions, though, were conceived directly in response to the Feminist Art Coalition, including “New Time: Art and Feminisms in the 21st Century,” Ms. DiQuinzio’s large intergenerational and international survey of recent feminist art practices going on view at her Berkeley institution.
“Witch Hunt,” which Ms. Ellegood is organizing in partnership with Cornelia Butler at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, focuses on how feminism is taken up in different ways by 15 midcareer artists around the world. Work by Teresa Margolles, who makes visible gendered, racial and economic violence in Mexico, may look overtly feminist. By contrast, the Portuguese artist Leonor Antunes creates more abstract, process-based work but it is in response to overlooked histories of women in the fields of design and architecture.
