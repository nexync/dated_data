NYT Parenting readers shared their experiences.
Brittany Dickey, 33, remembers breastfeeding in a mask.
In the fall of 2009, she contracted swine flu shortly after giving birth to her first child; she had a 104-degree fever the day she came home from the hospital. Her mother came to help take care of the baby, and Dickey tried not to breathe on her newborn.
As the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the United States, some pregnant women feel apprehensive and on edge, struggling to answer questions and keep calm as they plan for the future. NYT Parenting readers shared their stories about navigating the outbreak, and their own anxieties, while waiting to give birth.
Christine Jensen, 40, and her husband usually spend weekends at childrenâ€™s museums and aquariums with their 3-year-old daughter. Now that coronavirus has come to California, where they live, they spend more time outside, on hikes. They used to grocery shop as a family. Now, she tries to arrive at the store as soon as the doors open and get in and out as quickly as possible.
Jensen is pregnant and due in June, and worries if her parents will be able to fly out from upstate New York to visit. If not, she wonders, who will watch her daughter when she goes into labor? What will she and her husband do about child care if they both get sick? Their daughter is asthmatic, which adds another layer of complication.
