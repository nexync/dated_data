After their worst week since the financial crisis, stocks in the U.S. are now on track for their biggest weekly gain in years. What gives?
Joe Biden’s strong showing on Super Tuesday “reduced the fat-tail risk” of Senator Bernie Sanders, he said. Putting aside his own politics — he told the FT last month that “I might find it harder to vote for Bernie than for Trump” — Mr. Blankfein said that investors were significantly more comfortable with Joe Biden, but that he believed most of Wall Street was still rooting for President Trump.
As the coronavirus continues to spread, the business community could turn on Mr. Trump, Mr. Blankfein said. If the outbreak worsens, the president will “look like an incompetent manager,” said the former Goldman chief, and throw their support behind Mr. Biden.
Mike Bloomberg officially suspended his presidential run and endorsed Joe Biden yesterday after spending over half a billion dollars in the Democratic presidential campaign.
We understand that after Mr. Bloomberg’s abysmal showing on Super Tuesday — his only first-place finish was in American Samoa — there was lots of second-guessing. Should he have attended the debate in Las Vegas ahead of the Nevada caucuses? Could he have relied simply on his avalanche of advertising to carry him through to Super Tuesday?
We also hear that Team Bloomberg was genuinely surprised by Mr. Biden’s surge in recent days. The emotional speech that Mr. Bloomberg gave yesterday began to be edited in earnest 24 hours before.
Financiers also appeared taken aback, and heartened, by Mr. Biden’s strong showing. “People think we’ve turned a corner,” Tracy Maitland, the president of Advent Capital and a Biden supporter, told the NYT’s Kate Kelly.
The number of guests swelled at an L.A. fund-raiser last night, hosted by Sherry Lansing, former chief of Paramount Pictures, following Mr. Biden’s delegate haul. The former vice president regaled the crowd with a joke about his wife, Jill, acting as “my Secret Service,” after she shoved away animal rights protesters at a rally the day before.
Oil prices surge after Trump tweets about production cuts.
Another 6.6 million joined the U.S. unemployment rolls last week.
The Treasury Department hires investment banks to help with bailout programs.
It’s been an amazing journey over the past 100 days.
We had a differentiated customer value proposition and got buy-in from a deep-pocketed investor (😉). We had what looked like a perfect product-market fit, but it just couldn’t scale. Our solution resonated in American Samoa, but we weren’t able to get the traction nationwide that we needed to meet our goals.
The critics said nobody could deploy capital as aggressively as SoftBank in such a highly speculative venture, but we proved them wrong. We took on Mark Zuckerberg’s rules for promoting our product on Facebook, and won. You should be proud of how we changed the game — shoutout to the meme team! — and fought entrenched interests defending the status quo.
When the market suddenly changed and put a premium on sustainability, our blitzscaling strategy proved untenable. The responsible thing to do now is deploy our capital in other ways.
We will join forces with a Delaware organization for the next few months, and then pivot to the full-stack financial data solution that has served us well in the past — and made this adventure possible in the first place.
United Airlines announced yesterday a 10 percent cut to domestic services in April, along with a 20 percent reduction in international services and a hiring freeze. It was a sign that fears about the coronavirus had begun to hit ticket sales far from the outbreak’s hot spots, writes the NYT’s Niraj Chokshi.
“I don’t want you to give them any ideas,” President Trump said at a White House meeting with airline execs, in response to questions about whether carriers had asked for government assistance. They hadn’t, he said, and “it’s safe to fly.” But whatever the risks, each new day brings more companies banning business trips and cancellations of conferences around the world.
The producers of the 25th James Bond movie, “No Time to Die,” announced yesterday that the film’s release date had been pushed back to November, from April, “after careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace.” It’s not hard to see what they’re talking about.
Movie theaters in China — Hollywood’s most important market after the U.S. — have been shut for weeks, with South Korea and Japan starting to follow suit. Deadline reports that China’s theaters may not reopen until sometime between May and July.
Just last week, movie companies were feeling less queasy. The C.E.O. of the theater chain AMC Entertainment, Adam Aron, told analysts that coronavirus had had a “de minimis” impact on his company, and had forced the closure of only a few theaters in northern Italy.
