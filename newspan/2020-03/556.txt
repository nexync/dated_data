WENDY AND LUCY (2008) Stream on Amazon and Tubi; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. Kelly Reichardt’s latest movie, “First Cow,” about friends in mid-19th-century Oregon Territory who come to rely on a prized bovine, hits theaters this weekend. Her 2008 feature, “Wendy and Lucy,” also shows a relationship between human and animal in the Pacific Northwest. The film stars Michelle Williams as Wendy, a young woman who meanders through Oregon and Washington on her way to Alaska. Her main companion is a mutt named Lucy. A.O. Scott labeled it a “short, simple, perfect story” in his review for The Times. “Underneath this plain narrative surface — or rather, resting on it the way a smooth stone rests in your palm — is a lucid and melancholy inquiry into the current state of American society,” he wrote.
VERNON SUBUTEX Stream on Topic. A motley crew of Parisians drift in and out of “Vernon Subutex 1,” Virginie Despentes’s novel about a former record-store owner who starts living on the street. That book, the first volume of a trilogy, was shortlisted for the Man Booker International Prize in 2018. Its main character is played by the French movie star Romain Duris in this TV adaptation, which aired overseas last year but is now available stateside.
