What’s helping right now? What can you recommend to other teenagers?
What’s working for you right now? Have you been able to distract yourself with a movie? Find wisdom in a book? Lose yourself playing a game? Learn — or laugh — thanks to a podcast? Have fun at a digital gathering? Whether you have one idea or many, tell us in the comments.
In “What to Watch, Read and Listen To During Your Coronavirus Self-Quarantine,” The New York Times suggests a huge variety of ideas — but most of those are, of course, targeted to adults. We’d like to crowdsource our own thread of good ideas for teenagers.
— Oh, something mindless? The latest reality dating show sweeping the internet is Netflix’s “Love Is Blind,” in which strangers form relationships from one-person pods, and see each other only after they’re engaged. Beware, though: Despite the silly set up, you may find yourself emotionally invested.
— Interested in console, mobile, or PC games? The Guardian has just published a list with 25 suggestions, including “Pokemon Go,” which is making changes to allow for more monsters to be found closer to home.
How able are you now to distract yourself with a movie or a book? What kind of entertainment are you in the mood for in general?
What specific suggestions do you have for things to read, watch, listen to, cook, play, stream or otherwise engage with right now? Post just one suggestion, or many, and explain why.
Are there things you’ve always wanted to learn, read, watch or do that you’ve never had time for before that you might accomplish now? If so, what and why?
After you post some ideas, read the comments of others and reply to or “recommend” the ones that interest you for any reason.
