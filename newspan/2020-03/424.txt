The United States added its voice to growing calls for the Tokyo Games to be rescheduled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee is urging that the Summer Olympics in Tokyo be postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, adding its large and influential voice to a growing chorus of athletes and sports federations objecting to having the Games go on as scheduled in late July and early August.
The International Olympic Committee said Sunday it would make a decision on postponing or otherwise altering the Games within four weeks.
But that timeline has been met with skepticism and derision, with Canadaâ€™s Olympic committee saying it would not send its athletes this summer and the Australia committee telling its athletes to plan for an Olympics in 2021. Surveys of athletes are showing that most favor a postponement, because it has become increasingly difficult to train as countries impose broad restrictions on movement and shut down gyms and other facilities.
The United States committee, representing the largest delegation of athletes at the Games, said in a statement Monday night from its chair, Susanne Lyons, and its chief executive, Sarah Hirshland, that it had made the decision after reviewing a survey that yielded responses from 1,780 American athletes.
