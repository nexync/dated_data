Police departments have their own guidelines and policies about officers photographing and sharing images of a crash or crime scene.
He noted that the Police Department last week warned its officers about leaking official photos and videos to the news media in the aftermath of a shooting last month at a Bronx precinct house that sent an officer to the hospital.
“It’s not surprising that there would be a cohort within the larger group of officers who find sharing that material irresistible,” he said.
In addition to the anguish sharing such photos might bring to victims’ families, it also could create legal issues. “The existence of unofficial photos could become an issue for both prosecutors and defense counsel should a criminal case be pursued,” he said.
