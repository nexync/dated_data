Don’t underestimate the moral anguish of deciding who gets a ventilator.
I fear these doctors and nurses and other first responders will burn out. I fear they will suffer from post-traumatic stress. And with the prospect of triage on the horizon, I fear they will soon be handed a devil’s kit of choices no healer should ever have to make. It’s a recipe for moral injury.
An article published on March 23 in The New England Journal of Medicine estimates that the number of American patients who will require ventilation for the coronavirus could be as high as 31 per machine. A New York hospital, according to The Washington Post, is already putting two patients at a time on ventilators designed for one.
But Stephen Xenakis, a psychiatrist and retired brigadier general who has spent decades treating veterans, says that rules aren’t sufficient to inoculate first responders from psychological suffering.
