Mo Willems, Gene Luen Yang, Amie Kaufman and other authors for young readers are reading their work online and offering drawing tutorials, to help fill our strange new hours.
In response to the dozens of canceled books festivals, three young adult writers decided to start the Everywhere Book Fest, “a virtual gathering of kid-lit authors, books and readers that will bring the book festival experience to everyone,” according to their website. The festival is the brainchild of Ellen Oh, who also co-founded the nonprofit We Need Diverse Books, and Christina Soontornvat and Melanie Conklin. “There’s a real opportunity here to change the way people connect with authors and interact with books,” Conklin told Publishers Weekly.
