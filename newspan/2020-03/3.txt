You’re so close to a big pot of beans, baked oats, pasta with tuna, a vegetable soup and a hearty crumb cake. Melissa Clark can get you there.
This month, as the coronavirus expanded its reach, I began contributing pantry-focused recipes to The Times’s live blog. Each dish — some of which are riffs on old favorites — is highly adaptable, and all keep perishables in mind. Yes, some may mention optional fresh ingredients for color and verve, but use them only if you have them on hand. The idea isn’t to send you to the store for a bunch of cilantro, but to empower you to substitute those celery leaves you already have, or to skip the greenery entirely.
The first solves the “what to do with all those beans” conundrum. A big vat can be a hearty meal unto itself, the starting point of so many others, or both. Eat some right after cooking drizzled with good olive and sprinkled with flaky sea salt, and save the rest — yes, they freeze well — for turning into chili or soup.
