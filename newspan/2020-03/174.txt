There are various reasons the government steps in to rescue a failing company or entire sector. Weâ€™ll probably be hearing all of them soon.
In normal times and in most cases, the process for dealing with a company that runs out of money is straightforward. It goes to court and files for bankruptcy protection; shareholders generally get wiped out or close to it; and the business is either restructured (in Chapter 11) or liquidated (in Chapter 7), with whatever is left divided fairly among those the company owed money to.
So they directed funds from the bank bailout toward loans to help G.M. and Chrysler through a restructuring. It was hardly a free lunch for the automakers. Both went through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, autoworkers unions agreed to restructured contracts, and the companies were allowed to end onerous contracts with dealers. But the industry stayed open for business.
