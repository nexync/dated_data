A fantasy inspired by the music of the Beatles lands on HBO, and a true crime series from FX comes to Hulu.
THE SHOP: UNINTERRUPTED 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Hosted by Maverick Carter, LeBron James’s childhood friend and business partner, this talk show gathers big names in sports, business and entertainment for a no-holds-barred round-table discussion in a barber shop. This new episode features seven guests, including the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the actor Chadwick Boseman and the rapper Roddy Ricch, who discuss their various industries and the basketball star Kobe Bryant’s legacy, with occasional comedic relief from the actor Tiffany Haddish.
 True-crime fans can probably zip through this new series in a single day. Based on Gary L. Stewart’s book of the same name, the show follows Stewart’s journey in search of his biological father. After 10 years of digging, he comes to believe his father was none other than the Zodiac — the unidentified serial killer who murdered six people in Northern California in the late 1960s. All four episodes of the series debuted on FX on Friday, and they are now available to stream on Hulu.
