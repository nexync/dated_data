As supplies have dwindled, doctors and nurses have improvised ways to make their stock last. Now they’re urging leaders to help.
Now, doctors, nurses and others are rallying on social media with the hashtag #GetMePPE, referring to personal protective equipment like masks, gowns and face shields, to put pressure on elected leaders to get them more gear to guard against infection. Some suggested that members of the public reach out to a nearby hospital if they had masks or other medical equipment to donate.
Days later, Dr. Al-Agba asked her medical distributor to order gowns and N95s — but they were already all sold out. Then, she said, she was told by a regional health care nonprofit that has been helping to distribute medical supplies that she could not get any protective equipment because she wasn’t on the front line.
A person is more likely to get infected by touching contaminated surfaces than from a droplet traveling through the air, according to infectious disease experts, who also warn about accidental contamination by touching the outside of the mask.But they also encourage health care workers to take serious precautions, given the risk their work exposes them to.
