A shortage of ventilators is bad. A shortage of doctors and nurses critically compounds the problem.
Some of the most important specialties needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic are intensivists and critical care nurses â€” the physicians and nurses specially trained to manage ventilators and life-supporting medications essential for critically ill patients. There are currently fewer than 65,000 physicians, physician assistants and advanced practice nursing intensivists and about 550,000 critical care nurses in the United States. Those physicians who have been trained to care for patients in the hospital, known as hospitalists, are another crucial specialty, but there are only a little over 50,000 in the United States.
