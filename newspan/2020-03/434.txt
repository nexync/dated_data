President Trump will conduct the high-profile diplomatic gathering by teleconference instead, a White House official said.
WASHINGTON — The Group of 7 summit will not be held as scheduled at Camp David in June but will instead be convened by teleconference because of the coronavirus outbreak, a White House official said on Thursday.
On Monday, Mr. Trump held a teleconference with members of the Group of 7 leading industrial economies, which include Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. During the meeting, the officials pledged to coordinate on public health measures and to work to restore consumer confidence.
After initially vowing to continue to meet with supporters at political rallies and fund-raisers, Mr. Trump has canceled campaign events as the virus has spread throughout the United States. But the Group of 7 is the largest diplomatic gathering he has rescheduled so far this year.
Several Group of 7 member countries have been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, none more than Italy, which has reported more than 41,000 cases. On Thursday, the number of deaths linked to the virus there soared to 3,405, exceeding the toll in China, where the virus first emerged. And in France, the government ordered citizens this week to stay inside for the next 15 days to contain the spread of the virus as European Union officials considered a 30-day shutdown of nonessential travel.
In October, Mr. Trump’s handling of the Group of 7 meeting came under intense scrutiny when his administration said the event would be held at his resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, drawing accusations of a conflict of interest. Two days later, the president announced that he would hold the meeting at Camp David.
