(No. 1 is Fabiano Caruana.) The article also misstated part of the name of the I.B.M. computer that defeated the world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997. It was Deep Blue, not Big Blue.
An article on Tuesday about a woman facing charges of embezzling $1.5 million from the Kirov Academy of Ballet paraphrased incompletely from remarks by Pamela Gonzales de Cordova about the leadership team that is addressing concerns at the ballet academy. Ms. de Cordova said Tatiana Moon, the academy’s board president, and the school’s artistic director, Runquiao Du, had also played critical roles.
An article on Friday about museums in New York that focus on immigration referred imprecisely to a result of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act. The act eliminated a quota on Chinese immigrants that remained in place after the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was formally repealed in 1943; it did not repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act itself.
A Hungry City review last Wednesday of the Brooklyn restaurant Rice & Miso described incorrectly how rice koji is made. It is infused with mold, not bacteria.
