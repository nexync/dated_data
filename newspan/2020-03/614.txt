The man died from cardiac arrest and his wife was initially listed in critical condition, according to hospital officials, who said on Monday that the woman had been upgraded to stable condition and was expected to make a full recovery. Their names were not released.
Dr. Daniel Brooks, medical director of the Banner Poison and Drug Information Center, said in an interview on Monday night that the couple’s attempt to self-medicate was a cautionary tale.
Dr. Brooks said the couple had read about chloroquine phosphate on the internet, which he said was cluttered with a lot of misinformation about treatments for Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. He said the public should rely on authoritative sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and state health officials for medical advice — not the internet or politicians.
The woman told NBC News on Monday that she had heard Mr. Trump make repeated mentions of chloroquine during recent White House briefings on the coronavirus and that she used chloroquine phosphate to treat her koi fish.
During a briefing on Friday, Mr. Trump suggested that two long-used malaria drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, could be effective in the treatment of the coronavirus. The drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
Dr. Brooks said 85 percent of people who get the coronavirus don’t need medical treatment. As of Tuesday morning, the coronavirus had a fatality rate of about 1.2 percent in the United States, according to health officials. Dr. Brooks said antiviral medications were used only in patients who had tested positive and are critically ill. The medications need to be closely monitored because they can have serious side effects, he said.
