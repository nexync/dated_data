Intensive care beds are lacking. One area of Yorkshire has 35 beds to accommodate what could be hundreds of seriously ill patients.
The government has promised 40 million pounds, or about $52 million, for vaccine research, and said it would fund whatever urgent building work the health service needed to combat the coronavirus, like more isolation areas in hospitals.
It has also floated some bold ideas to deal with the bed shortage, like creating an extra 5,000 intensive care beds or treating people with at-home ventilators. It has even said it may be necessary to recruit retired doctors to help. But doctors were baffled by some of the proposals and unconvinced by others.
