“You need a female fish,” says Josh Lang, site manager at Sterling Caviar’s white-sturgeon farm in Elverta, Calif. It’s nearly impossible to ascertain a sturgeon’s sex from the outside; Lang and his team use ultrasound on 3-year-old fish to spot testes and ovaries. (Male fish and females with small ovaries are killed for meat.) When the fish are 6, start yearly biopsies by inserting a thin flexible sampling straw into the abdomen and pulling out a few eggs. “To determine whether it’s ready, you need to see, touch and taste it,” Lang says.
It is still legal in some places to catch sturgeon in the wild and harvest their eggs, but it is strongly discouraged, because most sturgeon species are critically endangered. Take caviar from a farmed fish. Squeeze the little glop of eggs from your sampling straw between your fingers. You’re looking for firm, equal-size eggs about three millimeters in diameter. If you see smaller, white eggs, they aren’t mature. Squishy roe indicate that the fish has begun to reabsorb her eggs, in order to recoup energy if stressed or if spawning conditions aren’t right. “You’ll need to wait about two years before that fish is ripe again,” Lang says.
Caviar can occasion fancy feelings, but it’s good to situate those momentary sensations in geologic time: Sturgeon evolved more than 100 million years ago; they were swimming in murky rivers when dinosaurs roamed.
