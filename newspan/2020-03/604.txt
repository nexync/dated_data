Every time he opens his mouth, he puts the American people at risk.
For the good of the nation, for the health of the country, in the interest of doing something drastic to mitigate a national disgrace, President Trump should self-quarantine.
Nothing reveals character like a crisis. Friday’s press conference was a panderfest to a man who kept saying “I don’t take responsibility at all” for the lag in testing, all while insisting that “we’re doing a great job.” Then he lied again, saying it’s “been true for a while” that anyone who wants a test can get one now.
Trump’s prime-time address to the nation on Wednesday was a full-blown disaster, blaming Europe, congratulating himself, fanning confusion and panic. Even reading a script from a teleprompter, this executive could not deliver a truthful, coherent message to a jittery nation.
Wall Street panicked. White House aides were quick to issue clarifications and corrections. No, the president did not intend to declare economic war on the world’s largest trading bloc, in Europe. No, insurance companies would not suspend co-pays for coronavirus “treatment” — only testing.
Since the coronavirus outbreak, Trump and his senior aides have been deliberately misinforming the public — 28 falsehoods or dubious claims, by CNN’s count. The president said cases were “going very substantially down,” when they were growing exponentially. He said anyone who wanted a virus test could get one, when there were massive shortages. He said, “This is a flu,” though Covid-19 has a fatality rate 10 times greater than the flu.
In that bizarre appearance at the C.D.C. a week ago, Trump wore a silly campaign hat, patted himself on the back, and spoke nonsense about his medical expertise. It was like showing up at a funeral in beach clothes and asking what time is happy hour.
Tom Hanks, in just a few words revealing that he and his wife had tested positive for the coronavirus, was the best American voice of the week.
