The Consumer Product Safety Commission investigates the safety of products, ranging from studying whether drawstrings on children's’ coats and sweatshirts pose a choking risk, or whether to issue a recall of lead-tainted toys from China. Watchdog groups say the agency, which was created in 1972 to protect the public against “unreasonable risks” from consumer products suffers from budget cuts and insufficient staff to monitor the more than 15,000 regulated items.
