For the 15 years it’s been around, the Book Review’s podcast has never missed an episode. But during the coronavirus crisis, we’re going back to our archives for the time being. This week, we have an episode from just about a year ago with the great biographer Robert A. Caro.
Caro had just published “Working,” a collection of pieces about how he writes his prizewinning books. With readers eagerly awaiting the fifth volume of his epic series about the life of Lyndon Johnson, Caro spoke about his new book and all that had come before.
Also on this episode, the poet Reginald Dwayne Betts recited the Joseph Brodsky poem “May 24, 1980”; and Gregory Cowles, Tina Jordan and John Williams talked about what they were reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
