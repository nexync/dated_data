Some creators are giving online classes, or hosting drawing challenges.
As effects of the coronavirus are rippling through the economy, including at bricks and mortar stores, comic book writers and artists are rallying online to offer activities for those staying at home. They are offering scripting lessons, art activities and even posting some of their own public service announcements.
And on Tuesday, Diamond Comic Distributors announced that it was allowing stores to sell new issues immediately, instead of having to wait until Wednesday, traditionally the day new comic books come out. Morgan Perry of Boom! Studios was using Twitter, meanwhile, to compile a list of retailers who were resorting to curbside pickups, home delivery, or snail mail.
Simone, who has written for DC, Marvel and just about every other company, is offering #comicsschool on Twitter — five days of lessons on writing comics. Those lessons, which end on Wednesday, are being archived so new students can catch up at any time.
The opportunity for outreach had special meaning for Simone, who grew up in a rural area and was told her dream of being a writer was “unrealistic.” She was discovered online, and this is her chance to help others like herself, she said in an interview via Twitter. “It is always in the back of my head that there are thousands of people, maybe millions of people, who have desire and talent and ambition, but lack a support system,” she said.
