Politics|Could the 2020 Election Be Postponed? Only With Great Difficulty. Here’s Why.
With Louisiana and Georgia delaying their primary votes, we answer six key questions about holding elections in a crisis. And no, a president cannot cancel an election with executive authority.
The coronavirus outbreak is inflicting new disruptions on the 2020 presidential campaign by the day, but few compare to the decisions by Louisiana and Georgia over the past 48 hours to reschedule their upcoming primary elections.
The postponements were a highly unusual development in an American political campaign, though not an entirely unprecedented one.
Why are Louisiana and Georgia moving their primary elections?
Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, announced Saturday that he was postponing the March 24 primary until May, and the Democratic Party of Georgia said it had endorsed the decision.
The four states with elections coming up on Tuesday — Florida, Ohio, Arizona and Illinois — have taken other precautions to make voting safer without shifting the date of their primaries. It is possible, however, that some later-voting states could follow the example of Louisiana and Georgia.
While such last-minute changes are highly unusual, states have broad autonomy to define the timing and procedures for primary elections. The exact process for setting primary dates varies from state to state. That is why a number of states changed the dates of their primaries and caucuses between 2016 and 2020, and why Republicans in several states were able to cancel their 2020 primary elections to minimize intraparty competition for President Trump.
