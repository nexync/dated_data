The NBC sketch-comedy series will not return “until further notice.” It’s the most recent late-night show to be affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
“S.N.L.,” which is currently in its 45th season and is broadcast from NBC’s New York headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, joins the ranks of other programs like “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” “Late Night With Seth Meyers” and “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” which have all halted their seasons during the spread of the coronavirus.
During its many years on the air, “S.N.L.” has occasionally been suspended in midseason by writers’ strikes. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the show was back on the air in less than a month; its Sept. 29 season premiere that year opened memorably with an introduction by then-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the singer-songwriter Paul Simon, who performed “The Boxer,” a song about showing resilience in the face of hardship.
