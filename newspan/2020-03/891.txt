A Boston emergency room doctor’s battle of words with the coronavirus.
Dr. Elizabeth Mitchell had just come off back-to-back work shifts in the emergency room at Boston Medical Center last week and was not sure how to think about what she had experienced. In almost three decades as an emergency physician, she, like her colleagues, was used to feeling invincible. She had regularly treated patients facing horrific trauma. She had grabbed gloves and rushed toward the smoke while working during the Boston Marathon bombing.
In hospitals across the country, the lack of widespread testing and the severe shortage of protective gear have left health care workers fretting for their own safety, and for the public’s. The virus is as invisible as it is dangerous. “You can’t see it, and you don’t know what is going to happen,” Dr. Mitchell said.
One recent morning after a long shift in the E.R., Dr. Mitchell took a walk in her neighborhood and noticed a daffodil blooming, a reminder of spring’s renewal. It contrasted with so much in the landscape around her that had changed — neighbors closeted behind closed doors, the protective armor she had to wear to work, all the uncertainty in the air.
After her walk, Dr. Mitchell sat down and wrote a poem.
and bags of flour stood in upright ranks.
speak soothing words and seek the answer to your pain.
still and calm inside their waiting shields.
This is the apocalypse.
