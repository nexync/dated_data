Body temperature varies considerably both among and within people, based on weight, height, physical activity, the weather, clothing. Older people tend to be cooler than younger people. A recent review suggests women might tend to be slightly warmer than men. Temperature also fluctuates with the sleep-wake cycle. Of course, public health officials can’t know each person’s usual thermal patterns, so their advice is based on population averages. Yet those numbers aren’t consistent, either, and most refer to oral temperature, which is considered more accurate than an infrared scan of the forehead. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers above 100 to be a flu-related fever. The National Institutes of Health says an adult with a temperature above 99 “probably” has a fever, depending on the time of day. Before the current pandemic, hospitals would generally assess fever and act upon it differently in response to individual patients and diagnoses; schools have had various thresholds to determine when parents should keep their children home. Perhaps the most well-known benchmark is 98.6 degrees, which many people, including physicians and public health agencies, consider to be a baseline. “All of us think back to our mothers taking our temperature and saying: ‘It’s 98.6. You’re going to school,’” says Dr. Julie Parsonnet, an infectious-diseases specialist at Stanford University.
