The postmodern take on the classic, directed by Jamie Lloyd, will have a limited run in May.
The Jamie Lloyd Company’s West End revival of “Cyrano de Bergerac” is coming to the Harvey Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music for a limited run in May. Directed by the theater company’s namesake, Jamie Lloyd, the adaptation by Martin Crimp is a postmodern take on the Edmond Rostand love story, featuring beatboxing, silver-tongued characters in street clothes.
The play is scheduled to run from May 8 through May 31. Tickets go on sale for members on March 10 and for the general public on March 20.
