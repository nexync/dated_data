The Dublin-based architects Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara have practiced together for 40 years.
When designing a campus for a new University of Engineering and Technology in Lima, Peru, the Dublin-based architects Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara thought deeply about how to integrate the wind and the rain.
It is because of that sensitivity to the natural elements, as well as qualities like their emphasis on collaboration, that the pair was selected to receive the 2020 Pritzker Prize, making them the first two women to share the profession’s highest honor. The award was announced on Tuesday.
In a telephone interview, Ms. Farrell and Ms. McNamara said they have not sought the kind of public recognition the prize represents, preferring to be known for “a way of thinking and a set of values,” Ms. McNamara said, rather than for some kind of identifiable design signature.
Ms. Farrell, 68, and Ms. McNamara, 67, said that the human experience of what it’s like to move through, walk by and inhabit their buildings is of paramount importance to them.
The architects said they also try to be keenly mindful of the physical demands of a building and a site, to design for a specific set of requirements, whether they are planning a generous quadrangle for a business school in Paris or a building that serves as a porous gateway to the London School of Economics.
