All eyes on Montana.
Bullock, the two-term governor of Montana, is the only Democrat with a decent chance of winning the U. S. Senate election there this year. But Bullock had been insisting he would not run. Without him in the race, the Democrats’ chances of retaking the Senate would be significantly smaller. And only if the Democrats control the Senate, the House and the White House in 2021 is there any prospect of major action to combat climate change.
Yesterday, multiple news organizations reported that Bullock might be changing his mind and could soon announce that he would be running. He would be facing the incumbent, Steve Daines, a Republican and one of President Trump’s most eager supporters in Congress.
“Bullock running for Senate could end up having a bigger impact on a Democratic president’s domestic agenda than who wins the presidential nomination right now,” Benjy Sarlin of NBC News wrote.
If Bullock does run, he will face a tough race. Trump won Montana by more than 20 percentage points. But Bullock is a talented politician and a moderate Democrat who has won three statewide races in his career (one as attorney general). His joining the race would turn it from a likely Daines landslide to something much more uncertain. Montana’s other senator, Jon Tester, is a Democrat now serving his third term, and he and Bullock have similar political personas: simultaneously populist and centrist.
Now that Biden has become the favorite for the nomination, the Democrats’ chances for winning races are starting to look better in places like Montana, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia.
