A 3-year-old girl died after being trapped inside a burning car in Queens on Sunday night, the authorities said.
The girl, Zoey Pereira, who lived in Queens, was pronounced dead at Jamaica Hospital, the police said. Emergency workers found her inside a 2008 Audi Quattro around 9 p.m. near the intersection of Rockaway Boulevard and Baisley Boulevard, a short distance north of Kennedy International Airport.
Her father fled the vehicle and ran into a pond before he was taken into custody, the police said. He was transported to Jamaica Hospital and treated for burns while remaining in police custody.
No charges have been filed against the father, who has not yet been identified by the authorities.
A propane canister and chains were found near the car, but investigators have not determined how or if they were used, the police said.
