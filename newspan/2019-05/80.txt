Judge Rosemarie Aquilina in Erin Lee Carr’s documentary film about Larry Nassar’s decades-long trail of sexual abuse.
As Carr’s documentary demonstrates, Lawrence G. Nassar, the former doctor for the American gymnastics team, exploited this mind-set when he sexually abused hundreds of girls for decades. His victims were often so young as to not realize what was being done to them, but had also bought into the stoic philosophy of a sport in which pain is a constant.
The many revelations about Nassar have already been widely reported, but Carr’s film, which is also available on HBO, works as a worthwhile précis, featuring interviews with many of the women who came forward. Nassar had been active for so long that the victims’ ages vary widely; some had known him for years and even considered him a friend.
There is a lot to go over here — including the many individuals who covered for Nassar in an effort to protect a money-making sport — and one 90-minute documentary can only do so much. What really comes through, however, is how Nassar abused the trust of being not just a doctor, but a seemingly kind, well-liked one. Sometimes, we learn, the molestation took place while a parent was in the room; everyone just assumed that if a doctor was doing it, it couldn’t be wrong. It’s a chilling reminder that real predators rarely look and act like movie monsters.
