Much of Grace Talusan’s memoir, “The Body Papers,” will be familiar to any reader of immigrant narratives. But what renders the book memorable — perhaps what earned it the Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing — is the author’s unstinting self-portrait. We see Talusan clearly in the present, warts and all, precisely through the stark, lucid representations of herself in the past. Having moved with her family from the Philippines to suburban America when she was 2 years old, Talusan recalls complex feelings of loss, displacement and adjustment.
Then there’s the inevitable exposure to racism, as a brown-skinned girl growing up in a predominantly white Boston neighborhood. She is teased by a third grader who makes “ching-chong sounds while pulling back the corners of his eyes.” Later, when she dates white men from the military, she can’t help recalling how back home, Filipina bar girls were looked down upon for liaisons with Americans in uniform. The depth and virulence of racism is brought home to her when her African-American husband gets beaten up so badly she can hardly recognize him in the hospital.
Her triumph is short-lived. The psychic pain worsens as she grows up, debilitated by depression. In college she fights the urge to self-mutilate.  As it turns out, he too was regularly brutalized by the paterfamilias as a child.
Another physical challenge springs from Talusan’s heredity: She and her sisters have a genetic predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. She opts for a pre-emptive double mastectomy and an oophorectomy. At the doctor’s office, she weeps for the children she will never have, assuaged only by the unshakable love between her and her husband. In such powerful, evocative scenes as this one, “The Body Papers” comes fully alive. Now a lecturer at Tufts University, Talusan chronicles that fraught passage from one world, one body, to another, marking with sensitivity how an American life can be both burden and benediction.
