RALEIGH, N.C. — The Carolina Hurricanes put a 35-year-old goalie in net and welcomed back their teenage draft pick. Another young star set up their graying captain’s tiebreaking goal.
That blend of young and old has the surging Hurricanes on the verge of a sweep.
Sebastian Aho assisted on Justin Williams’s key goal with 9 minutes 45 seconds remaining, and Carolina beat the Islanders, 5-2, on Wednesday night to take a 3-0 lead in their second-round series.
Teuvo Teravainen had two goals, including an empty-netter with 57.1 seconds remaining, and Aho added another empty-net goal with 4.8 seconds to play. Justin Faulk also scored for the wild-card Hurricanes, who moved to the verge of the Eastern Conference finals in their first playoff appearance in a decade.
After losing the first two games of their first-round series against Washington, they have won seven of eight and will try for the sweep Friday night.
Josh Bailey had a goal and an assist and Devon Toews scored on the power play to jolt the Islanders’ slumbering offense, but it wasn’t enough to keep the team from a precarious spot. Only four teams in N.H.L. history have won a series after losing the first three games. The last to do it was Los Angeles, against San Jose in the first round in 2014.
Curtis McElhinney — who at 35 years and 343 days became the oldest N.H.L. goalie to make his first playoff start — stopped 28 shots in place of Petr Mrazek, who is day to day with a lower-body injury. After McElhinney made two bang-bang saves in the second period while doing a split, the crowd chanted his first name.
The rookie wing Andrei Svechnikov, a 19-year-old who had been in the concussion protocol after taking a punch from Alex Ovechkin in Game 3 of the Washington series, returned to the lineup for Carolina.
Robin Lehner stopped 34 shots for the Islanders, but his career record against the Hurricanes fell to 0-7, with three of those losses in this series.
