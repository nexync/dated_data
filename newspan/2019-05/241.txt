You’ve Seen Mary Elizabeth Winstead Onscreen. Get Ready for Her Onstage.
Fans of indie fare may also remember Ms. Winstead’s un-showy honesty as a recovering alcoholic and elementary schoolteacher in the drama “Smashed,” opposite Aaron Paul.
And she continues to branch out. She made an album of swoony pop songs with the producer Dan the Automator (not under her own name, but as Got a Girl) in 2014. And now Ms. Winstead is testing herself anew: She is co-starring in a revival of “Dying City,” Christopher Shinn’s subtly suspenseful drama of grief and manipulation, that runs at Second Stage Theater until June 30.
Ms. Winstead recently sat down for a chat in a rehearsal room at Second Stage. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Did doing live shows with Got a Girl help alleviate your jitters?
It’s not your stage debut, though: Didn’t you do “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” in Salt Lake City with Donny Osmond?
Ha! I was 13. If you’ve seen that show, you know there’s a choir of children who sit onstage all the time and sing occasionally — I was in that. It was an incredible experience for me as a little kid but I didn’t continue down the path of theater and around that age I started working in TV and film.
Your IMDb page is getting pretty long. Which projects were keystones?
Definitely “Smashed” was a huge one for me. I unlocked something that made me go, “O.K., I understand myself a little bit more, and I understand how I’m going to be able to bring that to the role I play.” It brought a new level of confidence in terms of being able to connect with all kinds of characters — they didn’t have to be like me in order for me to bring them fully to life.
