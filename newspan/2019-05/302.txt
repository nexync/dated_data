From ‘Veronica Mars’ to ‘Stranger Things,’ 22 new and returning TV shows to put on your calendar.
More more more. However you like it, television has it this summer: “Four Weddings and a Funeral” reinterpreted by Mindy Kaling, Meryl Streep joining the beach party on “Big Little Lies,” new adventures from “Stranger Things,” continuing horrors on “The Handmaid’s Tale” and — for those with specialized tastes — a barely recognizable Russell Crowe playing Roger Ailes in “The Loudest Voice.” From more than 50 new and old shows premiering over the next three months, here are 22 to check out, in my own order of anticipation — beginning with a new chapter of a modern classic that made our list of the best dramas since “The Sopranos.” All dates subject to change.
