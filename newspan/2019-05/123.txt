After nearly 300 episodes, “The Big Bang Theory” wraps up on CBS. And “Skyfall” is on Syfy.
THE BIG BANG THEORY 8 p.m. on CBS. When this nerd-chic sitcom began in September 2007, Alessandra Stanley wrote in a review in The New York Times that 2007 was “the year of breakthroughs: First the iPhone, now the tall, dark and handsome nerd.” You could argue that “The Big Bang Theory” turned into something like the iPhone of sitcoms: wildly popular and filled with tech. When it ends its run on Thursday with a finale double-feature of two episodes, “The Big Bang Theory” will have been the longest-running multicamera comedy series ever. Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, the show made a star out of Jim Parsons, whose Sheldon Cooper character (one of the show’s awkward scientists) has earned Parsons four Emmy Awards and is the focus of a spinoff, “Young Sheldon,” which will be left to carry the torch — or light saber.
GOOD SAM (2019) Stream on Netflix. In real life, when a reporter has a subject that involves an unknown person capturing the attention of a big city by periodically performing the same act in different locations around the city, it is seldom under happy circumstances — particularly if that mystery figure is given a nickname for those deeds. But this feel-good Netflix movie focuses on positive news: In its fictional New York, an unknown person nicknamed Good Sam has been leaving bags filled with $100,000 on random doorsteps, and a young TV reporter (Tiya Sircar) tries to discover the individual’s identity.
