The pop artist is retooling his “American Utopia” show for a 15-week run from October to January.
David Byrne is bringing his “American Utopia” show to Broadway.
The art-pop musician, who became famous as the lead singer of the Talking Heads, is working with the theater director Alex Timbers and the choreographer Annie-B Parson to revise the show for the stage.
The Broadway run, at the 1,050-seat Hudson Theater, is scheduled to begin performances Oct. 4, to open Oct. 20 and to close Jan. 19. It will be preceded by an 18-performance production at the Emerson Colonial Theater in Boston, from Sept. 11 to Sept. 28.
In an interview, Mr. Byrne said that Broadway “hasn’t been a driving ambition in my life,” but that from the very first iteration of the “American Utopia” tour, which began early last year in New Jersey, people had seen it as theatrical.
“American Utopia” began as an album released in March 2018, and the tour traveled to 27 countries last year. The stage show, which features a dozen musicians including Mr. Byrne, has songs from the album but also solo songs, tracks from the Talking Heads and even a Janelle Monáe song.
The “American Utopia” Broadway run is being produced by Kristin Caskey, Mike Isaacson, Patrick Catullo and Todomundo.
