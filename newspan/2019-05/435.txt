When At War began, it was as a way for The Times to offer expanded coverage from the war in Iraq. But the onetime blog has evolved considerably in the decade-plus since then, and a prime example of that shift was featured in At War this week.
Aron Heller, who reports from Jerusalem for The Associated Press, wrote about two Jewish Canadian airmen who served during World War II: Mickey Heller, his grandfather, and Wilfred Canter, who died in 1948 fighting for Israel’s independence.
While the author’s grandfather, who had a successful career in Toronto and is now 97, has spoken little about his experiences in the war, it was because of the elder Mr. Heller’s memories that Mr. Canter’s story lives on.
“Though he steadfastly refuses to share his personal war experiences, my grandfather notes with pride that about 40 percent of the military-age Jewish male population of Canada enrolled for active service, most of them volunteers who were dispatched overseas,” Mr. Heller wrote.
Lauren Katzenberg, who edits At War, told me that historical articles exploring families’ experiences in past wars are among the many new features that have been introduced since the forum was officially relaunched last year.
But the evolution started well before that. After initially supplementing coverage of conflict, At War grew into a venue for service members, veterans, military families, policymakers and others connected to the military to weigh in on relevant issues, said an earlier editor, James Dao, who is now Op-Ed editor for The Times.
After a brief hiatus, C.J. Chivers, a former infantry officer in the United States Marines and one of The Times’s most prominent war correspondents, championed a revival of At War in yet another form.
Its coverage now includes accounts from wars without any American involvement, articles on how women are affected by war and first-person accounts from noncombatants like relief workers. The group produces an equally compelling newsletter, which you can subscribe to here.
An aside: John Ismay, a staff writer for At War, was an explosive ordnance disposal officer in the United States Navy. (If you’ve seen “The Hurt Locker,” you have some idea of his previous career.) Along with Chris Chivers, he’s a resource for all of us in the newsroom when we need expert guidance on guns, ammunition and explosives.
We will cover everything from fertility and pregnancy to the basics of baby-and-kid care and developmental milestones. We’ll also offer support for your life as a person and a parent, touching on topics including how to make mornings easier and how to not murder your spouse after baby (though you may sort of want to).
One thing NYT Parenting won’t be doing is using the term “natural birth.” Jessica lays out the case against that phrase here.
And, yes, there’s also an NYT Parenting newsletter.
