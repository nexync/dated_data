MILWAUKEE — Giannis Antetokounmpo started the game with an emphatic dunk. The next possession, a sprawling block to deny Marc Gasol. The next possession, another dunk.
The tone was set. And it never changed.
The Eastern Conference does not belong to Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks — yet. But they’re two wins away, after Antetokounmpo had 30 points and 17 rebounds, Ersan Ilyasova came off the bench to add 17 points and the Bucks never trailed on the way to a 125-103 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Friday night and a 2-0 lead in the East finals.
How he finished, too.
Antetokounmpo scored 11 points in the fourth for the Bucks, who had six players in double figures — three of them reserves. Nikola Mirotic scored 15, Malcolm Brogdon had 14, George Hill 13 and Khris Middleton 12.
Kawhi Leonard scored 31 points for Toronto, which gave up the game’s first 9 points and trailed by double digits for the final 39 minutes. Kyle Lowry scored 15, and Norman Powell had 14 points for the Raptors.
“We didn’t do much well tonight, obviously,” Raptors Coach Nick Nurse said.
Game 3 is Sunday in Toronto.
“We’ve got a chance to go home, protect home court and do what we’re supposed to do,” Lowry said.
Milwaukee, an N.B.A.-best 60-22 record during the regular season, became the 16th team to start a postseason with at least 10 victories in its first 11 games. Only the 1989 Los Angeles Lakers, the 2001 Lakers and the 2017 Golden State Warriors opened the playoffs 11-0.
The Bucks led by as many as 28 points before Toronto did enough chipping away to keep some semblance of hope.
Eventually, Antetokounmpo decided enough was enough. With 5 minutes 51 seconds left to play, Antetokounmpo backed Leonard down on the block, spun back toward the center of the lane and scored while being hit, starting a 3-point play. He yelled to the crowd and punched the air. The knockout blow was landed, and the Bucks are two wins from their first N.B.A. finals berth in 45 years.
“At times, I forget that I have to stay aggressive,” Antetokounmpo said.
Not in that moment, he didn’t. Aggression wasn’t an issue for the Bucks at any point.
Milwaukee’s lead was 35-21 after the first quarter, and 64-39 at the half. It was the first time Toronto had been outscored by 10 or more points in each of a game’s first two quarters since May 25, 2016, against Cleveland. The 25-point halftime hole was, by far, the Raptors’ worst of the season. They trailed Houston, 55-37, on March 5.
Toronto was down 21 when Lowry got his third foul with 1:27 left until halftime. The Raptors left Lowry in; he wound up getting his fourth foul while battling Mirotic for a rebound 24 seconds later and headed to the bench. Another roll of the dice did not pay off, either: Raptors forward Pascal Siakam got his fourth foul shortly after halftime and then got his fifth with 9:26 left in the third.
Antetokounmpo started the second half with a 3-point play, pushing the lead to 28. That is when Toronto found a bit of a groove. The Raptors outscored Milwaukee by 31-16 over the next nine minutes, making it 83-70 on a 3-pointer by Fred VanVleet. But a quick flurry by the Bucks restored order: Brogdon rebounded his own miss and scored, then set up George Hill for a score in transition, and Hill scored again off a Raptors turnover a few seconds later.
Just like that, the lead was back up to 19, and it was 95-78 going into the fourth.
