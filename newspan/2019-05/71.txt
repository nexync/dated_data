A “Saturday Night Live” season finale is traditionally an occasion for the show to pull out all the stops, leave everything on the stage, tear it all down and figure out how to put it back together in the fall. In this weekend’s conclusion to “S.N.L.” Season 44 (which was hosted by Paul Rudd), the musical guest DJ Khaled certainly brought it, performing with a pantheon of surprise performers including Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Meek Mill, SZA and John Legend, while also paying tribute to the rapper Nipsey Hussle, who was fatally shot in March.
And, well, Alec Baldwin and the “S.N.L.” cast tried their hand at a musical number of their own.
Revisiting his role as the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, Robert De Niro attempted to halt the performance, declaring that he had “something very important to say to the American people — something they need to hear.” But Baldwin simply talked over him — “No collusion, no obstruction,” he said — and resumed the number.
Speaking from the “Weekend Update” desk, Cecily Strong reprised her role as Jeanine Pirro, the Fox News personality who was suspended by the network earlier this year for anti-Muslim remarks. After expressing her gratitude to “the brave sponsors who stuck with me despite the accusations by the radical loony left,” Strong took intermittent sips from a martini glass and emptied its contents on the “Weekend Update” anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che.
