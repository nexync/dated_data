The signs, if you’re looking for one, are there.
Many of these photos are part of the new book “Lee Friedlander: Signs,” from the Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco.
Each of these visual cues, vying for just a second of New Yorkers’ attention, hints at the mundanity of city life: menu options at a restaurant, illuminated by neon tubes; Times Square billboards attempting to sway passers-by to give their brand of underwear a chance.
But taking a step back, New York is a land filled with a desire, and signage can translate various human yearnings to the masses. Only through the scribbled-on cardboard message and a mask that reads “weed head” do you learn that this person wants money for a joint. And only through an insurmountable number of sale signs does it become apparent how hard the American market works to persuade people to part with their hard-earned dollars.
But the arc of history is long, and of course, the implications of some signs can change over time.
In the years since 2012, when he photographed a billboard of Donald Trump and the words “Prove It!” it turns out that Mr. Friedlander did not document just a sign, but also a sign of things to come.
