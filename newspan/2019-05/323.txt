Watch a preview of our television show, “The Weekly,” which will feature The Times’ investigation of the taxi industry. Mohammad Hossain emptied his savings to buy a taxi medallion. He had no idea he had just signed away his financial freedom.
A lot of the medallion owners that we’ve talked to have filed for bankruptcy. Have you thought about doing that? Yeah. What are you thinking about? Why haven’t you, yet? Who me? Yeah. I bought medallion from the city. I think city will help me. You know? I see on the... I know so many drivers they kill themselves. But I have a family. I love my family. So I don’t want to kill myself. My life is more important for my family. I love my family, than medallion. So you can’t give up for your family? Yeah. On the same day that Mohammad bought his medallion so did 167 other drivers. Since then, 40% of them have filed for bankruptcy. If you look at enough of their loan documents you notice patterns. These drivers signed away their rights, paid huge fees and never came close to settling their debt. While the people they trusted made all the money and shared none of the personal risk. There was the city, which sold the medallions, the brokers who collected commissions and the bankers who wrote the loans and sold some of them for profit. Eventually, you realize that this wasn’t by accident. Many insiders knew that the whole thing was a house of cards.
