Ibram X. Kendi on books to help America transcend its racist heritage.
 If dark people have less it is not because they are less, a moral eloquently conveyed in these two classic novels, stirring explorations of colorism.
Just as Metzl explains how seemingly pro-white policies are killing whites, Forman explains how blacks themselves abetted the mass incarceration of other blacks, beginning in the 1970s.
