“Harry Potter: A Journey Through Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts” and “A Journey Through Potions and Herbology” are arriving in late June.
The books, described as “bitesize reads,” will each be based on subjects studied at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, attended by Harry and his friends (and enemies). The series, titled “Harry Potter: A Journey Through …” and illustrated by the London-based artist Rohan Daniel Eason, is, according to the website, inspired by and adapted from “Harry Potter — A History of Magic,” the companion book to the 2017 British Library exhibition of the same name. Like that book, the e-books will feature manuscript pages, notes and sketches alongside the text.
