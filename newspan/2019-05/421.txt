Sorry, Steve Mnuchin. Congress Has a Right to See Trump’s Tax Returns.
The Treasury secretary is defying the law and Supreme Court precedent.
As to whether Congress may obtain a president’s tax returns, there is no ambiguity: Federal law empowers the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to submit a written request to the Treasury Department, which oversees the Internal Revenue Service, for “any return or return information.” The Treasury secretary then “shall furnish” the requested information to the committee so that it may conduct its legislative functions.
Perhaps that statute is not clear enough for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The secretary on Monday rebuffed just such a request from Representative Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. In April, Mr. Neal requested six years’ worth of federal tax returns for President Trump and several of his companies.
In examining Mr. Trump’s tax returns, Congress could determine that legislation forcing disclosure of a candidate’s tax returns is necessary to guard against future presidential corruption and conflicts of interests.
Mr. Neal is well aware of these precedents, which he cited in a follow-up letter to the I.R.S. 10 days after his initial request for Mr. Trump’s records. He seems to be preparing for a showdown in the courts, which, if history serves as a guide, should give him and his committee the latitude to continue their legislative functions unimpeded.
