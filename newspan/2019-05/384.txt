MIAMI — Marlins starter Pablo Lopez followed his worst outing as a big leaguer with his best — both against the Mets.
The result was Miami’s first winning streak in nearly a month, and ramped-up speculation that Mets Manager Mickey Callaway’s job was in jeopardy.
“I’m coming in tomorrow to manage the New York Mets and I’m going to be enthusiastic about it and I’m going to continue to lead this team to something special,” Callaway said after his team was held to one hit on Saturday in a 2-0 loss.
The Marlins, with the worst record in the majors, beat the Mets for the second straight day after entering the series with a seven-game losing streak. The Mets lost their fourth in a row, falling to a season-worst four games under .500.
Callaway is in his second year with the Mets, who made numerous changes in the off-season.
Third baseman Todd Frazier defended his manager.
Lopez (3-5) gave up a double to Jeff McNeil on his first pitch and then combined with the Marlins’ bullpen to hold the Mets hitless the rest of the way. He pitched seven innings and tied a career high with seven strikeouts.
It was a bounce-back performance for Lopez, a 23-year-old right-hander, who allowed a career-high 10 runs in three innings in his last start on May 10 at Citi Field.
Tayron Guerrero got four outs and Adam Conley finished for his second save. A crowd of 13,474 saw the Marlins record their first one-hit shutout since four pitchers combined to throw one on May 7, 2017, against the Mets in New York.
Jon Berti hit his second home run of the season and Brian Anderson knocked in the other run for Miami, which won consecutive games for the first time since back-to-back wins against the Washington Nationals on April 19 and 20.
Steven Matz (3-3) was activated from the 10-day injured list to make his first start for the Mets since May 3 at Milwaukee. He allowed two runs and five hits in three and two-thirds innings. He struck out six and walked two.
