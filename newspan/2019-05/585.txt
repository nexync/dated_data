The A.C.L.U. of Massachusetts says we should be concerned about violations of privacy.
“Investors Pressure Amazon Over Facial Recognition” (Business Day, May 21) exposes growing unease among some shareholders about selling face surveillance tech to government. It isn’t just investors who should be rattled.
The police want this technology to increase investigative efficiency. They say it zeroes in on suspects faster, and can detect if someone “looks” antisocial. That’s frightening, given that M.I.T. researchers found that the technology reinforces biases and performs poorly on people of color, especially women.
The harms aren’t theoretical: A Brown University student was recently misidentified by face recognition as a bombing suspect in Sri Lanka. After the police put her picture on TV, she was sent death threats by vengeful strangers.
Even if this technology gets more accurate, do we really want government having unrestricted power to track anyone, anywhere, anytime? Americans deserve more privacy than that. It’s not government’s business where we pray, whether we attend A.A. or if we visit an abortion clinic.
Bipartisan lawmakers in Massachusetts have proposed legislation to press pause on face surveillance. We should all support them. Otherwise, our freedom is in the hands of Amazon’s biggest shareholders.
