In an interview with T: The New York Times Style Magazine, Rihanna opened up about the inspiration behind her first release by Fenty, her new luxury fashion house, and how inclusivity has helped build her business.
Her different brands, which include a beauty label and a size- and gender-inclusive lingerie line, have changed the way black women are viewed as consumers. Fenty Beauty, for instance, debuted with 40 shades, many of which were for darker skin and not previously widely available.
She has since added 10 more foundation shades to her makeup line and is planning more.
With Fenty Beauty, she said, she offered black women something they couldn’t find on the shelves at Sephora.
The brand has been praised for being inclusive to women of all skin tones, from rich, dark complexions to very light ones. Stores ran out of supply shortly after the products went on the market.
Black women are often an afterthought when it comes to beauty brands. Most product launches consist of a range of lighter shades, with a promise that darker shades are on the way in a later release, or as part of a separate product line.
But for the pop star, diversity is not a box to tick off when launching her lines: It’s her reality.
And while Rihanna seeks to be inclusive of people of all genders, shapes and sizes, for her, her blackness is not what elevates her products.
And indeed, many are invested: the luxury giant LVMH, the people who can finally find their shades at Sephora, the women who feel comfortable in her lingerie and, perhaps most of all, her fans.
