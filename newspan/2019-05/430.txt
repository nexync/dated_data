MY DAD WROTE A PORNO (2019) 10 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. When Jamie Morton, a British writer and director, discovered that his father had written an erotic novel, he shared it with his friends James Cooper and Alice Levine. The three marveled not just at the fact that Morton’s dad had produced the work — he’s written four books so far — but that much of the writing was, well, not great. In 2015, they created the podcast “My Dad Wrote a Porno,” in which Morton reads a chapter from the series while Cooper and Levine provide commentary. Since then the show has been downloaded more than 160 million times and has spawned a book and quirky merchandise. (Morton told The Financial Times that his father loves it, even though it mocks his own work: “Fundamentally, my dad doesn’t quite grasp that he’s a bad writer at all,” he said.) In this new comedy special, the three perform a reading in London and invite audience members to join the fun onstage.
