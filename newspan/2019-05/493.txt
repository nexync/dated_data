WU-TANG CLAN: OF MICS AND MEN 9 p.m. on Showtime. When the Wu-Tang Clan emerged onto the New York City hip-hop scene in the early ’90s, the group seemed almost like a team of rap superheroes. Now that many of its members, like RZA, GZA, Method Man and Ghostface Killah, are household names, the filmmaker Sacha Jenkins decided to tell the group’s origin story. In this four-part docuseries, he sits down with each of the nine living members — many of whom where childhood friends in Brooklyn and Staten Island — to talk about how they became one of the most influential rap groups of all time. Weaving together interviews with archival footage and performances, the show reflects on the members’ lyrical genius, entrepreneurship and sociopolitical consciousness, which still resonates with audiences.
