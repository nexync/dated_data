A map with an article on Tuesday about the measles outbreak in the United States misstated the number of measles cases reported in New York in 2019. There were 493 cases in the state this year as of April 29, not 659, which is the total number reported since September 2018.
An article on Wednesday about President Trump’s threat to place a full embargo on Cuba misspelled the name of the opposition leader in Venezuela. He is Juan Guaidó, not Juan Guiadó. The article also misstated the day on which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela had planned to flee to Cuba and the day that President Trump threatened a tougher embargo. Both statements were made on Tuesday, not Monday.
An article on Tuesday about Tesla’s plans to reduce the price of its solar panels failed to factor in a federal tax incentive’s impact and made an incorrect comparison between the price of Tesla’s residential solar panels after a planned reduction and the average national price for such panels. The price of the Tesla panels, after accounting for the incentive, will be $1.75 to $1.99 per watt. The average national price, after accounting for the incentive, is $2.09 per watt. The article also misstated the difference in price between the lower-cost Tesla panels and the national average. It will be up to 16 percent, not up to 41 percent.
An article on Tuesday about the historical data stored in tree rings misstated when a cosmic ray event described as the strongest found in the tree ring record happened. It occurred from 774 to 775, not in the year 744.
