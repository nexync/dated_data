Natural ecosystems, they explained in extensive detail, provide invaluable material services to people, from mangrove forests that protect millions from coastal flooding to wetlands that help purify our drinking water to insects that pollinate our fruits and vegetables. The loss of wild plant varieties could make it harder in the future to breed new, hardier crops to cope with threats like increased heat and drought.
In other words, they concluded, when we destroy nature, we undermine our quality of life.
That’s a compelling argument, and it is one that many conservationists and ecologists have emphasized in recent years. There is now an entire field of research around “ecosystem services,” in which scientists try to quantify in dollar terms all the benefits that nature provides to humanity, in order to make an economic case for conservation. That argument got a lot of play in our article.
But it has been 27 years since the first global treaty to protect biodiversity, and the world’s nations are still faltering in their efforts to halt the decline of natural ecosystems around the globe. That helps explain why the authors of this latest report felt they had to appeal more forcefully to humanity’s own naked self-interest. Though it remains to be seen whether this approach persuades world leaders to pay closer attention.
