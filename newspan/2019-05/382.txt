In fact, a letter of support authored by the British and Spanish prime ministers, Tony Blair and José María Aznar, was signed by the heads of six other countries (the Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Portugal). In addition, 10 Eastern European countries from the Vilnius Group signed a separate letter backing the Bush administration.
To be sure, millions of Europeans did indeed oppose the war and they were joined by the leaders of Germany and France, but the heads of some of the Continent’s largest countries (Italy, Spain and Portugal) were among those who gave their backing to the Iraq invasion.

When asked in By the Book (May 12) what books are on his nightstand, Adm. William McRaven responded, “I always have the Holy Bible close by.” Subsequently in the interview, he included Voltaire (“incomparable mind”) in his list of three invitees to a hypothetical literary dinner party, and when asked who might be chosen to write his life story he named Mark Twain.
This interesting mix of choices begs additional explication.
In their essay “Why So Many Books About Dogs?” (May 5), Vanessa Woods and Brian Hare ask, “After at least 14,000 years of living with dogs, why are we only now getting around to considering what goes on inside their heads?” They should read Italo Svevo’s “Argo e il Suo Padrone” (“Argo and His Master”), a humorous depiction of a dog’s mind, first published as a fragment in 1927 and in full in 1934. And if they want an early tear-jerker with a happy ending they might try Ada Negri’s short story “Un Salvataggio” (“A Rescue”), published in Erba sul Sagrato in 1939. Clearly, as far as Italian literature is concerned, it’s not “only now” that dogs and their minds matter.
