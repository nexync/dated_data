WASHINGTON — As the House’s day wound to a close on Monday, a sumptuous feast was being laid out in the Capitol Visitor Center.
Dates, spiced rice, baked pumpkin, salad and fruit — and cans of whipped cream for sundaes. It was all prepared for an iftar, the meal eaten each night after sunset to break fast during Ramadan, Islam’s holiest month, and it was the first one hosted on Capitol Hill by three Muslim members of Congress.
For Representatives André Carson of Indiana, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, all Democrats, it was a historic moment: being able to break their fasts with colleagues and take pride in their faith.
The event was sponsored along with Muslim Advocates, a nonprofit legal and advocacy organization, and was held midway through Ramadan, which began May 5. During Ramadan, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset for 30 days.
Although Speaker Nancy Pelosi was unable to attend because of meetings that kept her late into the evening, other members of the House and Senate leadership — including Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois — took part in the ceremony.
It highlighted not only the diversity of the new Democratic House majority, but the enduring support for Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib, who have been celebrated as the first Muslim women elected to Congress, even as critics have attacked them for their political positions and for remarks some critics say are anti-Semitic.
Among the allusions to the enduring scrutiny of Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib, those present emphasized unity. They were here, several said, to support not only Muslims, but others facing increased threats and persecution around the world.
At 8:18 p.m., the room fell silent. As the first plates of dates began to circulate, an imam’s voice rang out in prayer, signaling that another day of fasting was over.
