Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is not quite ready for retirement.
Roethlisberger said Friday that he had told the Steelers of his plans to return to the team for the 2017 season.
Roethlisberger, a two-time Super Bowl winner who turned 35 last month, hinted after Pittsburgh lost to New England in the A.F.C. championship game that he needed to take stock before committing to another season. But the team remained confident he would return.
“There is no question Ben wants to win championships for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and we know he will do everything possible to lead our entire team to achieving that goal,” Coach Mike Tomlin said in a statement.

The Tigers blew a 4-0 lead in the top of the eighth, but the Red Sox relievers quickly gave it back. Heath Hembree walked two batters, and pinch-hitter Mikie Mahtook followed with a game-tying double off Robby Scott. Joe Kelly then allowed consecutive walks to James McCann and Jones, forcing in the final run.
