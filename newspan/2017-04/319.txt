The Justice Department had asked for a delay earlier this week, saying it needed time to review the plan and determine whether the proposal, called a consent decree, would hinder efforts to fight violent crime in the city. Federal District Judge James K. Bredar said the hearing would go on as scheduled on Thursday.
Judge Bredar noted that it was “highly unusual” that both the city and the Justice Department had requested the hearing to allow Baltimore residents to comment on the proposed consent decree.
A Justice Department spokesman, Ian Prior, declined to comment.
The Obama Justice Department opened an investigation into accusations of misconduct in the Baltimore Police Department in 2015, after the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who sustained a neck injury while in police custody, plunged the city into unrest. The department published a scathing report outlining widespread abuses, including excessive force, unlawful stops and discriminatory practices.
Last month, dozens of organizations and about 50 people submitted 195 pages of written comments on the proposed agreement, which the city reached with the Justice Department during the last days of the Obama administration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo this week announcing his intention to review all existing consent agreements.
The Justice Department’s request to postpone the hearing was met with fierce opposition from city officials, including Mayor Catherine E. Pugh and the police commissioner, Kevin Davis, both of whom vowed to press on with an overhaul of the Police Department regardless of what happens with the consent decree.
But Commissioner Davis and Ms. Pugh emphasized that a court-enforced agreement would enable the department to put those changes in place.
