As President Trump took the stage to champion the Second Amendment at a National Rifle Association convention on Friday, a United States senator sought to counter his message by unleashing a Twitter storm using the names, ages and pictures of gun violence victims.
Here's my advice. Turn off cable. Don't watch @realDonaldTrump's NRA speech. Instead, think about who we are fighting for.
Mr. Murphy then posted 11 messages showing the faces of shooting victims, many of whom were children, including four of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Conn.
In a statement on Friday to The New York Times, he said he had started the tweet storm because he knew that “the substance” of the gun-control debate would get “totally lost” amid coverage of the president’s speech in Atlanta.
A spokeswoman for the N.R.A.’s Institute for Legislative Action said that Mr. Murphy’s posts were a stunt.
