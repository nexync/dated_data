SATURDAY PUZZLE — Have you ever just lit up at the sight of a new entry? I did today, and darn that Jeff Chen, he held that surprise until the last Down entry.
If you’ve never read Randall Munroe’s “XKCD,” here is your free rabbit hole. And to its enthusiastic fan base, let me get ahead of a potential situation and say yes, I know that the name is officially written in all lowercase, but since it’s an entry in the puzzle, I’m using all capital letters. Please don’t hurt me. But you can take heart in the fact that the brilliant, stick-figure-drawn webcomic with the wonderfully Scrabbly name that doesn’t actually mean anything makes its New York Times Crossword debut today.
It’s not like the rest of the puzzle isn’t lively, because it is. We’ve got the W.W. II VET coming out on top of the NETIZEN, and some very fresh and crunchy entries like ANTIGONE, HOUSE PET, ROOT BEER, SPLIT UP, FOLK ART, ROB A BANK, I SEE NOW, GETS DOWN, WOOL CAP, ANTIHERO, DWEEZIL, TIE SCORE, CAN’T FAIL, ONE HORSE, NUFF SAID and POOH BAH. This is a sparkling grid, and the cluing lives up to the challenge set by the entries.
■ 45A: “Tender spot?” is a tough clue. It sounds so innocent, like it’s merely talking about a simple bruise, doesn’t it? Not today. Today, “tender” means money (as in legal tender), and the spot where you might put it, which is a CASH BOX.
■ 6D: Yes, an OP ED is opinion, so “Slanted paper lines?” is a pretty spot on clue.
■ 12D: “Bikini” is not necessarily a bathing suit. It’s also an atoll where nuclear weapons were tested between 1946 and 1958, so the answer is TEST SITE.
W. W. II VET was the seed for this one, a curious string of letters I saw in a D-Day article a year or two ago. Not only is it bizarrely fun to have a “WIIV” series of letters, but I have a feeling that there are plenty of W. W. II VETs who are avid crossword solvers. I thought it would be awesome for them to get a shout-out to the greatest generation.
