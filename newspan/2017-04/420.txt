Broadway’s first a cappella musical will close on Sunday, unable to break through during an especially competitive season.
“In Transit,” which paints a loving portrait of New York City through the intertwining lives of a group of subway riders, opened on Dec. 11 after a month of previews. Reviews were weak, and the show has struggled from the start; last week it grossed $194,641, which is precariously low for a musical, and just 27 percent of its potential take.
At the time of its closing, it will have played 181 performances at Circle in the Square Theater, which is Broadway’s only theater in the round.
The musical’s lead producers, Janet and Marvin Rosen, supported it longer than many would have. He is a lawyer who once served as finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee, and they are close to the Clintons, who came to see the show.
According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the musical cost up to $7 million to capitalize. The show is closing without having recouped its costs, meaning that investors will lose much if not all of their money.
“In Transit” features music, book and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez (“Frozen”), James-Allen Ford, Russ Kaplan and Sara Wordsworth, and is directed by Kathleen Marshall (“Nice Work If You Can Get It”). The a cappella arrangements are by Deke Sharon (“Pitch Perfect”).
