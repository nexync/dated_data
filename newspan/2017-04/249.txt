In its first new episode in nearly a month, “Saturday Night Live” featured Alec Baldwin in a double dose of topical comedy, first in the show’s cold open, portraying President Trump as he typically does, then later reprising the role in a sketch where he also played the embattled Fox News host Bill O’Reilly.
Another audience member noted his failures on health care reform, but said he didn’t blame the president for being unable to get the job done.
Actually, the man answered, his wife was already in a drug rehabilitation program. Mr. Baldwin said he could relate: “My wife doesn’t want to move either, ” he said.
Later in the night, Mr. Baldwin returned as Mr. O’Reilly, whose Fox News program has lost several prominent advertisers after an investigation by The New York Times revealed multiple settlements over allegations of sexual harassment or other inappropriate behavior by Mr. O’Reilly.
Speaking to the reporter Malia Zimmerman (played by the “S.N.L.” cast member Cecily Strong), Mr. Baldwin tried to elicit details on an interview she said she had conducted with Susan Rice.
“Her vibe?” she asked.
In split-screen, Mr. Baldwin, now as Mr. Trump, said that he continued to stand by Mr. O’Reilly.
“I actually see a lot of myself in you, Bill,” the Trump character said.
