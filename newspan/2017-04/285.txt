Songkran, the water festival that celebrates the Buddhist New Year, officially begins today and continues for several days. In some parts of the country the water-flinging has already begun.
The celebration, traditionally a time of purification, retains some of its Buddhist beginnings. Many Thais return home for the holiday and observe water cleansing rituals.
