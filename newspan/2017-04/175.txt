MOGADISHU, Somalia — A suicide bomber wearing a Somali Army officer’s uniform blew himself up inside a military training camp in Mogadishu on Monday, killing at least seven soldiers, including senior officers, and wounding 15 others, officials said.
The Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that more than 25 soldiers had been killed, according to the group’s radio network, Al Andalus. The militant group boasted of what it called its ability to strike any target in Mogadishu.
“The bomber was disguised as a Somali Army officer and blew himself up,” said Abdikamil Moalim Shukri, a spokesman for the Internal Security Ministry.
The military training camp is near a former candy factory in the Wadajir district.
The Shabab have intensified their attacks against the government since Somalia’s new president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, also known as Farmajo, declared war on the group and replaced the leaders of the army, the police and international intelligence, as well as the mayor of Mogadishu, the country’s capital.
At least 10 people were killed in the city on Sunday, when a suicide bomber tried to ram a vehicle into a convoy carrying the new army commander, Gen. Ahmed Mohamed Jimale, outside the Defense Ministry, where he had taken the oath of office.
Many analysts contend that President Mohamed had rushed to declare the campaign against the Shabab before the newly installed army commanders agreed to coordinate plans and available resources.
In a separate episode earlier on Monday, an employee of the Somali Education Ministry was killed when a bomb thought to have been attached to his car exploded in the Hamar Weyne district of Mogadishu.
Abdifatah Omar Halane, a spokesman for the Banadir regional administration, where Mogadishu is, identified the employee as Abdikadir Osman Farah.
