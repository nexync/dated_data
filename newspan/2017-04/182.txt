Choose your poison: Samantha Bee roasts the president at a gala opposite the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. And the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inducts its latest class.
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS’ DINNER 10 p.m. on TBS. President Trump is skipping this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner — the first president to do so since the 1970s. His staff members are boycotting as well. But you can be sure that Mr. Trump won’t escape roasting, even in absentia, at this alternative gala presented by “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee” and hosted at DAR Constitution Hall in Washington by Ms. Bee, with proceeds going to the Committee to Protect Journalists. A red-carpet special leads in at 9, with an uncensored encore broadcast to follow at 11 — both on Twitter. The official CORRESPONDENTS’ ASSOCIATION DINNER, hosted by Hasan Minhaj of “The Daily Show,” is on C-Span, CNN and MSNBC at 9:30.
2017 ROCK & ROLL HALL OF FAME INDUCTION CEREMONY 8 p.m. on HBO. ELO, Joan Baez, Yes, Tupac Shakur, Journey and Pearl Jam were inducted into the hall this month at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, and this special has the highlights. Expect to hear ELO in “Evil Woman”; Joan Baez in “Swing Low Sweet Chariot”; Yes in “Owner of a Lonely Heart”; Snoop Dogg and Alicia Keys in a tribute to Mr. Shakur; Journey, without its estranged singer, Steve Perry; Pharrell Williams’s induction of Nile Rodgers; and David Letterman speaking on behalf of Pearl Jam, which performs “Alive” before a mass rendition of “Rockin’ in the Free World.” The ceremony also remembers Chuck Berry and Prince.
THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (1991) on iTunes and Amazon. Toast it with a Chianti: Jonathan Demme’s scary tour de force, an Oscar winner for best picture and director.
