ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS: THE MOVIE (2016) 8 p.m. on HBO. Pull out the Champagne flutes and snuggle up to Patsy (Joanna Lumley) and Edina (Jennifer Saunders), those hard-partying London fashionistas, as they adapt their BBC series for the big screen. The story hangs on Eddy’s efforts to revive her public relations career, but it’s really just a good excuse for air-kissing the likes of Stella McCartney, Kate Moss and Jon Hamm. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it “a happily self-conscious feature-length goof.” For more of the duo when they could still fit into their Lacroix, check out the original series on Amazon and iTunes.
WORLD FIGURE SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS 8 p.m. on NBC. Ashley Wagner, the world silver medalist, and her American teammates Karen Chen and Mariah Bell, chase after Evgenia Medvedeva of Russia, the reigning world champion, in Helsinki, Finland.
CATASTROPHE on Amazon. Season 1 of this sweet and filthy British comedy found Sharon and Rob — the Irish schoolteacher (played by Sharon Horgan) and the American ad man (Rob Delaney) — consciously coupling in London after a weeklong hookup led to an unplanned pregnancy. In Season 2, they’re coping with a baby sister for the toddler, Frankie, and the attendant struggles: postpartum ick, a visiting monster-in-law (Carrie Fisher) and a languishing career. And sex, or the lack thereof. “‘Catastrophe’ has the raw honesty of a mom on her second martini at a play date,” James Poniewozik wrote in The Times. Catch up before Season 3 arrives on April 28.
RED DWARF on BritBox. All 11 seasons of the British cult sci-fi space comedy land on this new streaming service from BBC Worldwide and ITV.
