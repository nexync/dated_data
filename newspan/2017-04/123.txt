Itâ€™s sad to read that Hillary Clinton is still blaming others for her loss five months after the presidential election. She cited misogyny, release of her campaign emails and the F.B.I. investigation into the use of her private email server as among the reasons she lost to probably the least qualified candidate ever.
One only hopes that during one of her long walks in the woods, she acknowledges, at least to herself, that her sense of entitlement, her inability to connect with a large sector of voters and her many missteps along a much abbreviated campaign trail are the real reasons for her loss.
Dear Hillary Clinton: But you did receive nearly three million votes more than Donald Trump! And for the second time in 16 years the Electoral College intervened. Time to do something about that.
The people spoke, and the states intervened.
