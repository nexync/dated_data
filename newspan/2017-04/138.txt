Trillin’s widely admired book is back in print for the first time in more than 20 years. It collects pieces he wrote for The New Yorker, the vast majority of which appeared from 1969 to 1986, about cases of “sudden death” in the United States.
“The New York Times Book of Crime” collects some of the most noteworthy, heartbreaking, intriguing stories that have bled and led throughout the paper’s 166-year history, from its coverage of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln to the capture of John Dillinger to the trial of Amanda Knox.
