In deciding whether the Khmer Rouge tribunal was worth it, consider the magnitude of its task. Demographic studies estimate that at least 1.7 million people, almost a quarter of Cambodia’s population, lost their lives under the Khmer Rouge. Millions more were forced to labor in cruel and inhumane conditions.
In June, the court will hear final arguments in the trial of Nuon Chea, No. 2 in the regime, and Khieu Samphan, a former head of state. By the number of victims, this is indisputably the biggest criminal trial since Nuremberg.
More than 236,000 people have attended the proceedings, and Cambodian newspapers covered testimony daily. Almost 4,000 victims are civil parties, this being the first international court where victims have this right.
The novel legal issues faced will set important precedents. The charges include forced marriage and rape related to the regime’s policy to select spouses and require couples to consummate the marriage. The allegation of genocide against the Cham Muslim minority depends partly on evidence of the killing of those who refused to give up their religion.
How the court interprets the applicability of the Genocide Convention to these facts will establish a critical precedent for determining whether the ISIS campaign of forced conversion of Christians and Yazidis constitutes genocide.
We often hear world leaders respond to reports of atrocities in places like Syria by calling for those responsible to be held to account. For those promises to be credible, the international community cannot allow crimes of the magnitude of the Khmer Rouge to pass unaddressed.
