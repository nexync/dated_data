• Tax plan puts business first.
President Trump plans to unveil a tax blueprint today that would apply a vastly reduced, 15 percent rate to a wide array of businesses, including his own. But it may omit a contentious border tax on imports.
Markets rose on the news, but our economics reporters caution that it is too soon to say if the administration can deliver on its promises.
Part of the inspiration for the president’s plan was a sketch on a white cloth napkin in 1974.

Last weekend, protesters marched in defense of scientific inquiry, spurred by a president who casts doubt on climate change.
They might have been pleased by today’s tale, of a government that turned to a citizen-scientist for answers.
On this day in 1803, a shower of 2,000 to 3,000 meteorites fell on L’Aigle, France. The French Academy of Sciences sent Jean-Baptiste Biot, a physicist, to assess the origin of the debris.
Mr. Biot concluded that the meteorites didn’t resemble anything on Earth and, considering accounts of “a rain of stones thrown by the meteor,” had to be from outer space.
Four years later, a meteor and its debris were seen in Connecticut, and two Yale scientists concluded they had come from space. President Thomas Jefferson greeted their findings with caution, however.
It wasn’t until later in the 19th century that meteorites’ extraterrestrial origins became widely accepted as scientific fact.
