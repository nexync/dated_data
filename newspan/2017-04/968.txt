Read the article and see what you think. For sure you’ll want to cook the recipe Christine scored off Deborah Madison in the course of her reporting: pan-griddled sweet potatoes with miso-ginger sauce.
Read, as well, our excerpt from Joan Nathan’s new book, “King Solomon’s Table,” about the food of the Jewish diaspora. It could set you up nicely for Passover next week, with a recipe for chicken with eggplant and Swiss chard and another for haroset with chestnuts, pine nuts and dried fruits. For dessert: orange-almond Mandelbrot, though if you’re making it for Passover you’ll need to do so with matzo cake meal.
And for dinner tonight, no recipe required? It’s a Wednesday tradition around here, to cook this way. Get some nice baseball-size Yukon Gold potatoes, one per person, and cut them into quarters. Toss them with olive oil, salt and pepper on a sheet pan, and slide them into a hot oven to roast. While they’re cooking: Fry some bacon; grate some Cheddar; grab a few large handfuls of spinach or baby kale; cut open and slice some avocados and see if there is some sour cream or plain yogurt in the fridge.
When the potatoes are soft, pull them from the oven and smash the pieces down with the bottom of a coffee cup or drinking glass. Arrange each four-piece smashed potato into a “portion” on the sheet pan, and top each one with greens, a slice of bacon, and plenty of cheese. Return to the oven to melt the cheese, then garnish with plenty of sliced avocado and dots of sour cream. Or yogurt! There are no rules. You could omit the bacon or replace it with merguez.
Now, check out this investigation of chicken bones found on the street, in Atlanta magazine.
It would be cool to be able to cook that way. Let’s try tonight. See you on Friday.
