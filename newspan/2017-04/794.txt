After college, in 1972, Mr. Tower alighted at Alice Waters’s pioneering Berkeley, Calif., restaurant, Chez Panisse. Together, he and Ms. Waters gave birth to the so-called California Cuisine, based on local ingredients and championed by the likes of James Beard. After a falling-out with Ms. Waters, Mr. Tower founded the restaurant Stars, a magnet for San Francisco’s political and show-business glitterati, and was bestowed a Dewars endorsement deal. But Stars, overextended (it had branches elsewhere in Northern California and overseas), was damaged and ultimately undone by an earthquake in 1989. After years in retreat, Mr. Tower resurfaced in 2014 to resuscitate the ailing Tavern on the Green in Manhattan. Despite his efforts, he was out a year later.
