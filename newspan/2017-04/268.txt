Lundqvist survived a shaky first period to make 31 saves in the Rangers’ 2-0 victory on Wednesday night in their playoff opener.
It will be up to the Canadiens to come up with an answer in Game 2 on Friday night at Bell Centre, or else risk heading to New York down two games in the best-of-seven series.
Montreal went 3-0-0 against Lundqvist and the Rangers in the regular season, continuing a trend from the last two seasons in which Carey Price has shone against the Rangers while Lundqvist has labored. But the same may not apply in the postseason.
When the Rangers knocked off the Canadiens in six games in 2014, a series in which Price was injured in the opening game, Lundqvist was pulled for Game 5 but bounced back with a Game 6 shutout. His shutout in this year’s opener put him in the career lead among active N.H.L. goalies with 10.
Tanner Glass scored in the first period. Montreal pulled Price late in the third, but Michael Grabner settled the issue with an empty-net goal with 1 minute 10 seconds left.
Montreal outshot the Rangers, 16-5, in the first period but could not beat Lundqvist.
Fired up by a national anthem performance by the 1960s pop star Ginette Reno, the Canadiens were all over the Rangers in the opening period, but it was the Rangers who struck first, at 9 minutes 50 seconds, on only their third shot. Montreal’s Tomas Plekanec won a draw in his own zone, but Glass, a fourth-line wing, pounced on it and lifted a backhand from the slot over Price’s shoulder.
“Certainly a goal helped to settle us down and get back to the focus and making the plays we needed to make,” McDonagh said.
Montreal Coach Claude Julien said he wanted to make “little adjustments” for Game 2.
The Canadiens had some clean chances but were up against a Rangers defense that did a good job of limiting rebounds.
