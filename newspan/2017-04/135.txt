Our Beirut bureau chief, Anne Barnard, who has covered the Syrian war for years, analyzed the grim logic behind the chemical attack, which the Turkish authorities said used the banned nerve agent sarin.

• The Syrian crisis threw a sudden shadow over the first meeting of President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China.
Frictions could emerge — likely only visible behind closed doors — because a faction of Mr. Trump’s advisers are urging an aggressive challenge to the $300-billion-a-year trade deficit. There is also likely to be an intense U.S. push for China to rein in North Korea.
Sometime after Mr. Xi’s departure, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order targeting steel dumping, a measure aimed at China, officials said.

Today is World Health Day, an annual awareness campaign set to the founding of the World Health Organization in 1948.
One of the United Nations’ earliest agencies, the W.H.O. combats disease and health emergencies like the Ebola and Zika outbreaks.
This year’s theme, depression, encourages people to seek and get help. The group estimates about 300 million people worldwide are living with depression.
For decades, the W.H.O. focused on combating communicable diseases.
Against the backdrop of the Cold War, the two superpowers raced to be the best; the U.S. took the lead fighting malaria, and the Soviet Union took on smallpox.
By the 1960s, some members of the W.H.O. felt they weren’t being supported, and the organization shifted its mission to primary care and disease prevention by the 1970s.
