Is It O.K. to Marry an Amnesiac?
About a year ago, a distant friend of our family learned of her condition and began a closer friendship with her. Their relationship has now turned romantic, and they are planning to move in together and are also discussing marriage. While I’m very happy that my sister has found someone to love and care for her, and I have no reason to believe that this man would ever cause her any harm, I’m having a very hard time accepting their relationship. He is a successful, well-educated man who is several years her senior, and I find myself questioning his motives — she’s very beautiful and sweet, but she finds it very hard to follow a conversation for any length of time.
