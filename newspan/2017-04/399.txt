The Metropolitan Museum of Art has long been a repository of dance-related artworks (looking at you, Edgar Degas), but next season for the first time it will invite a choreographer to be its artist in residence: Andrea Miller, the founder and artistic director of Gallim Dance.
Ms. Miller will create a number of works at the museum, including “Stone Skipping,” a site-specific dance that will be performed at the Temple of Dendur in October, the museum said Tuesday when it announced the 2017-18 season of MetLiveArts, its performance series.
The Met has been under financial stress and managerial turmoil this year — its director and chief executive, Thomas P. Campbell, announced in February that he was resigning under pressure — and next season it will offer fewer performances than it did this season.
But the performance series, which has been reimagined in recent years under the leadership of Limor Tomer, will continue to offer unusual fare, with a heavier-than-usual emphasis on dance. In addition to Ms. Miller’s residency, Faustin Linyekula, the Congolese dancer and choreographer, will create a work for the Vélez Blanco Patio, the Met’s 16th-century Spanish courtyard; the choreographer Eiko Otake will create pieces for the Met, the Met Breuer and the Cloisters; and “The Museum Workout,” a collaboration between Monica Bill Barnes and Maira Kalman, will return after this season’s sold-out run.
The museum will present a number of musical performances as well: the Aizuri Quartet will be its quartet in residence; the Shanghai Peking Opera will present “Farewell My Concubine” in the Astor Court, the Met’s Chinese scholar garden; and Ben Moore’s “Odyssey: A Youth Opera,” which was commissioned by the Glimmerglass Festival, will be given a new production.
