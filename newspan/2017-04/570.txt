In a 2014 speech at his old high school in Rhode Island, Sean Spicer laid out his personal guidelines for success. Rule No. 4: Take responsibility when you mess up, and you will be rewarded.
This week, Mr. Spicer is trying to take his own advice.
“On both a personal and professional level, yesterday was not a very good day in my history,” he told the MSNBC anchor Greta Van Susteren. His appearance, at a forum sponsored by the Newseum, was broadcast live by CNN and MSNBC, just one sign of the intense interest in the press secretary’s remarks.
Mr. Spicer, whose tenure as President Trump’s chief spokesman has made him a television sensation and late-night punch line, calls himself his own worst critic. And while he said “it’s an honor” to serve as press secretary, he also marveled to Ms. Van Susteren about the level of scrutiny that the role entails.
When Ms. Van Susteren moved on to other topics, some of Mr. Spicer’s usual feistiness resurfaced.
He complained about the Washington news media’s focus on palace intrigue over policy, and he repeated his laments about journalists’ reliance on anonymous sources. Responding to reporting based on unidentified sources, he said, was like “shooting at a ghost.” Ms. Van Susteren responded by pointing out that the president often made assertions without providing evidence or the source of his information.
Mr. Spicer also criticized the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, which the Trump administration is boycotting this year. “I don’t think that just sitting there and watching a bunch of celebrities walk by is somehow an indication of how much you care about or respect the press or the First Amendment,” he said.
