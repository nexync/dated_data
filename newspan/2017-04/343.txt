Each terrorist attack tests anew the values of openness and tolerance essential to free societies. Stockholm became the scene of another such attack on Friday when a barreling truck was turned, yet again, into a deadly weapon. This time four were killed and 15 were injured.
Though details are still being investigated, the attacker was apparently an Uzbek man who had been denied asylum and ordered to leave Sweden. This will no doubt add grist to the arguments of those — the autocrat Viktor Orban, the French right-wing presidential candidate Marine Le Pen — who conflate terrorists with immigrants in search of a better life and refugees fleeing deadly conflict.
But it will never be possible to stop every random madman from getting his hands on a truck and turning it into a weapon. More attacks are bound to happen. And, with each one, the temptation will grow to yield fundamental values in the name of security as stifling as it is illusory. The day we yield to that temptation, as Sweden’s prime minister reminds us, the enemies of freedom will have won.
