Once, several years ago, I left my building on West 73rd Street and saw a line of cars backed up behind a sanitation truck that was picking up in front of my building.
As I stood there, a woman got out of her car and marched indignantly up to one of the sanitation workers to complain that she needed to be somewhere soon.
Before the man could reply, a rat jumped through a hole in the bag he was holding and ran up his arm, perching momentarily on his shoulder while considering its next move.
Chastened, she spun around without uttering a word and returned to her car, where she waited for the truck to finish its stop.
