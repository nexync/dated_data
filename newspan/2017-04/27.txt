The corporate minutes of the Times Printing Company, publishers for many years of The Chattanooga Times, are as stupefying as you might think. I actually dozed off for a moment while slogging through the boilerplate recitations from the mid-1950s: “This being the annual meeting of the Board following the adjourned annual meeting of the stockholders, the president then presented to the Board the following list of officers — ” Lights out.
Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg was the last surviving board member to have been at that meeting.
Her death on April 19 was a reminder that the Ochs-Sulzberger family owned the liberal-leaning Chattanooga Times until 1999, when it was merged with its conservative rival, The News-Free Press. The Times and Free Press still maintain separate opinion sections.
It was also a reminder that Chattanooga did not always look upon The Times or the Ochs-Sulzberger family as benevolent forces — especially in the ’50s, as The Times began to espouse racial equality and desegregation. “Communist-infested New York” was how The News-Free Press described the city where The Times’s overlords held sway.
In 1955, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, who was the publisher of The New York Times and Mrs. Holmberg’s father, began prodding The Chattanooga Times to abandon its practice of segregating obituaries into white and “Colored” sections.
“I don’t think God is standing next to St. Peter to check the color of the spirits as they come through the gates,” he said, according to an account in “The Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind The New York Times,” by Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones.
“I don’t think it will help the paper,” she said. And she was right.
Mrs. Holmberg, then known as Mrs. Golden, became publisher of the Chattanooga Times in 1964.
“She continued its pro-civil rights stance, a stance that didn’t endear her to everyone here at the time,” Clint Cooper, the Free Press editor of The Times Free Press, wrote on Friday.
