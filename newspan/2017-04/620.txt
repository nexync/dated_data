Three people broke into a Brooklyn synagogue on Sunday and stole nine sacred texts valued at over $200,000.
Two men and one woman entered the rear door of the synagogue, Congregation Maase Rokach, on 12th Avenue at 55th Street in Borough Park, some time before 7:30 a.m., the police said.
Once inside, the intruders forced open a door to the basement library where the texts were stored. The texts were said to be valued at $223,000.
The theft was first spotted by a person associated with the synagogue who noticed significant damage to the basement door and saw that several books were missing from a book cabinet, according to a person in law enforcement, who discussed a continuing investigation on the condition of anonymity.
The thieves were spotted leaving with boxes in hand and drove away in a white Chevrolet Tahoe, the person said.
