KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS (2016) on Netflix. Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson), a Japanese boy with an eye patch and some magical powers — among them, storytelling and origami — is hidden in a cave by his desperate mother, who warns him not to go out after dark. But why is not immediately clear. The menagerie in this stop-motion-animated Oscar nominee includes a straight-shooting talking monkey (Charlize Theron), a samurai warrior cursed into the form of a giant insect (Matthew McConaughey) and masked twin sisters from the dark side of the moon (Rooney Mara). With gorgeous action and a moving story, “the director, Travis Knight, has put together a picture that hits a lot of all-ages-entertainment sweet spots while avoiding hackneyed conventions, and ends up delivering what feels like a sincere family-friendly message,” Glenn Kenny wrote in The Times.
