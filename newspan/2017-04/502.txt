Mr. Karimian had suggested that he hoped his work would change Iranian society. “We will do our best to create an Iran one day that we can take pride in,” Mr. Karimian said in comments that were broadcast posthumously on his own network on Sunday. Analysts said it was possible that Mr. Karimian might have been targeted by the state. “One cannot rule out the possibility that he posed a serious threat to a powerful stakeholder in Iran,” Mr. Vaez said. But he added that Mr. Karimian “doesn’t fit” the profile of someone important enough for the Iranian government to assassinate on foreign soil.
The Iranian Embassy in Turkey, the Turkish Foreign Ministry and Gem did not respond to requests for comment.
