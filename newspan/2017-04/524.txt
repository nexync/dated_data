As summer approaches, you’re probably trying to avoid thinking too closely about what it would be like to be attacked by a great white shark. But an entertaining — if harrowing — new book, “And Then You’re Dead,” by Cody Cassidy and Paul Doherty, shares the science behind some of our more terrifying experiential possibilities (and non-possibilities). The co-authors start by imagining a realistic scenario: a window popping out of an airplane. What would follow? First, you hope the plane hasn’t yet reached 20,000 feet. Also hope that you’re on the aisle. The most someone in the window seat can hope for is sacrificial glory — being sucked only partway out, and thereby serving as “a decent plug” for everyone else while being battered by 600-mile-per-hour winds (oh, and suffocating). There follow chapters about somewhat less likely things, like the fate of someone raised by buzzards. And what would happen if you traveled toward the moon or the sun or Jupiter. Closer to home, what if you were buried alive? Like many readers, I imagine, I couldn’t bear to look.
