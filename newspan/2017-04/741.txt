Artworks that have never been seen outside Italy — or even beyond the walls of a remote church near Venice — will arrive in New York starting this fall for two exhibitions at the Frick Collection, the museum announced on Friday.
Both paintings were commissioned in 1566 for a small chapel at Santa Maria degli Angeli, a church on the island Murano, part of the Venetian Lagoon and off the beaten path for tourists and scholars. Only “Saint Jerome” has been shown outside the church, and that was in 1939, at an exhibition in Venice.
Another Italian, Antonio Canova (1757-1822), will be the subject of “Canova’s George Washington,” scheduled to open on May 22, 2018.
Canova created only one sculpture for the United States: a monument to Washington, made to look like an ancient Roman leader (a suggestion of Thomas Jefferson’s), writing his farewell address. It was commissioned for the North Carolina State house in 1816 and unveiled in 1821. But a fire a decade later destroyed the statue, leaving behind charred fragments.
For this exhibition, the Frick plans to showcase Canova’s full-size plaster model of the monument, which has never left Italy, as well as draft sketches and related engravings and drawings from the Museo Canova in Possagno, Italy, where Canova was born.
