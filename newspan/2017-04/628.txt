The endeavor is an initiative of Harper’s Bazaar and Tiffany & Co. Harper’s declined to say how much it will cost. “It’s wildly expensive but it will be worth every penny,” Ms. Bailey said. (The animal projections from 2015 cost more than $1 million.) For those unable to attend in person, the projections will be streamed live from Harper’s Bazaar’s Facebook page.
