If you happen to be in Thailand today, don’t bother taking a shower: You’ll get soaked anyway.
Songkran, the water festival that celebrates the Buddhist New Year, officially begins today and continues for several days. In some parts of the country, the water flinging has already begun.
The celebration, traditionally a time of purification, retains some of its Buddhist beginnings. Many Thais return home for the holiday and observe water-cleansing rituals.
But the symbolic purification has exploded into a countrywide party. People play with water guns and dump buckets of water from the beds of pickup trucks. 
Even last year’s drought couldn’t stop the festivities, though some government officials asked festivalgoers to downgrade to spray bottles, which befuddled one university student.
Some Thai traditionalists are worried that the festivities have strayed too far from their origins. This year a government official warned merry makers not to “wear revealing clothes” or dance suggestively. Such transgressions will result in a fine of about $145.
