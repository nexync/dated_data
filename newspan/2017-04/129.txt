The war is expected to escalate further this spring as the portion of Helmand controlled by the Afghan government continues to shrink. According to provincial leaders, the Taliban now hold seven of the 14 districts that make up the province, the country’s largest in land area. The Afghan government fully controls only two districts and the provincial capital; the remaining five are contested, with the government generally controlling only the district centers.
