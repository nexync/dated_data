What’s your writing routine? Every morning, Monday to Friday, I get up at 6 a.m., and I read six or seven newspapers, look at my email and come here at exactly 8 o’clock. Everyone in the world that I know knows don’t call here, don’t email, I’m not going to answer. And then in the afternoon, I go in that room and sell the ideas.
Is eating a bowl of oatmeal part of the daily process? This is fake. I collect fake food. I don’t eat when I’m writing. I think it can lead to writer’s block if you eat a lot.
What object from this heap of bric-a-brac most inspires you? This great Grace Metalious figurine. Can you believe they sell this? She wrote “Peyton Place.” And she wrote “Return to Peyton Place” and “The Tight White Collar” and “No Adam in Eden.” That was her complete works. Then she got hugely successful and drank a lot and died. I loved her.
Why? “Peyton Place” was the first dirty book I read. And she scandalized the nation, right?
