BRENTWOOD, N.Y. — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo traveled to this community in Suffolk County on Wednesday to announce the creation of an anti-gang policing initiative to combat MS-13, the brutal transnational gang that he called “a current scourge” on the area.
Most recently, the gang has been implicated in the murders of four young men whose bodies were discovered on the edge of a town park in neighboring Central Islip this month.
As part of the statewide initiative, the State Police will increase undercover and uniformed operations in the area, adding 25 officers to the efforts of the local police and an F.B.I. task force to battle the gang, which has its roots in Central America. Officials said residents of Brentwood and Central Islip should expect to see a larger State Police presence in the area.
The violence in the area — MS-13 was blamed for 11 murders last year in Suffolk County, including those of two teenage girls who were brutally pummeled with machetes and baseball bats near a Brentwood elementary school in September — has drawn national attention, and Mr. Cuomo said the continued violence committed by MS-13 had prompted him to act.
In Suffolk County, law enforcement officials have expressed concern that the emphasis on deportations will drive witnesses and informants underground.
“That is a problem we have all across the board,” Mr. Cuomo said. “It’s gotten worse recently.” He reiterated that the State Police do not participate in immigration enforcement or control.
The Long Island Gang Task Force that some of the state officers will join includes about 30 agents, detectives and officers from federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.
More than a dozen suspected gang members were arrested in a recent sweep by the task force after the killings. The authorities said that at least 10 of those arrested were undocumented immigrants.
