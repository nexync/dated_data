Short men need fashion love, too. The big and tall have their own specialty clothing stores, as do the plus-size, while guys the size of Daniel Radcliffe (5-foot-5), Tom Cruise (5-7) or Bruno Mars (also 5-7) may find themselves pawing through the offerings in the boys’ department.
But in March, the men’s wear brand Peter Manning, which designs for guys 5-8 and under, expanded its online business and opened a store in Manhattan. Located on the third floor of a building in the Flatiron district, the shop has a discreet presence at street level, as if to acknowledge the mild embarrassment its customers may experience on their way in and out.
For men who have spent a lifetime wearing ill-fitting off-the-rack clothes, the store will seem an improbable wonderland. Jeans that don’t bunch at the ankles. Suits that fit without tailoring. Dress shirts that don’t feel like dresses. Polos in a range of colors, not just the last extra-small left, in fuchsia.
Pants under a 30-inch inseam aren’t generally sold in traditional stores. But Peter Manning offers shelves of chinos, jeans and corduroys that top off at 30 and go down to 26 inches, what might be called Danny DeVito (4-10) ready-to-wear. Even the ties have been shrunken ever so slightly.
The label has so far focused on core pieces at a moderate price ($98 for a button-down shirt; $450 for a blazer), with an all-American style similar to that of J. Crew or Gant. George Stephanopoulos (5-7) and Michael J. Fox (5-4) are both customers. Style has not been sacrificed for fit.
Mr. Hansen wants the Peter Manning store to be a destination for not-so-tall men across the land, who make up perhaps as much as 30 percent of the male population. That number may be higher in the city, at least from what he has observed.
