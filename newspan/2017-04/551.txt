All named defendants conducting business during that period, other than Sallie Mae Bank, continue to do so as Navient Corporation. Sallie Mae Bank was not formed until 2005, only began making private student loans in 2006 and has never serviced federal student loans.
As a consumer bank today, Sallie Mae annually provides $4.9 billion in high-quality private student loans to students and families. Responsible lending and disciplined underwriting have fostered customer success: 98 percent of our customers are in good standing, and less than 2 percent default annually. These efforts have earned an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and good working relationships with regulators.
