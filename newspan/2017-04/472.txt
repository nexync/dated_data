Here’s a look at what’s coming up this week.

The Fed’s top regulator heads for retirement after one more speech.

Trump will meet the Chinese president over two days.
President Trump’s meeting with President Xi Jinping of China at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Thursday and Friday leaves both sides with difficult choices about whether to emphasize geopolitical priorities or bilateral trade goals. The United States wants China’s help in confronting North Korea, while China wants the United States to play a lesser role in the South China Sea and Taiwan. But the United States also wants China to reduce its many barriers to imports, curb subsidies to exporters and stop forcing foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese competitors as a condition for entering the Chinese market. And China wants America to limit anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against Chinese companies by labeling China a market economy, and wants Mr. Trump to stop emphasizing the bilateral trade deficit.
March data will probably show a slight hiring slowdown.
On Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will release data on unemployment and hiring in March. Economists are looking for a gain of 180,000 jobs for the month, and for the unemployment rate to remain 4.7 percent.
