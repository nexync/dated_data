Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson struck a harsh tone at a Group of 7 meeting in Italy, saying that President Bashar al-Assad’s reign was “coming to an end.” Now he’s in Moscow, above, for what will be a closely watched meeting with Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov.
The White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, caused outrage when he contrasted Mr. Assad with Hitler and said incorrectly that Hitler didn’t use chemical weapons.

With key staff positions unfilled and no on-site first lady, the White House is scrambling to organize the most elaborate public event of the year. Last year’s drew 37,000 people.

The Justice Department is investigating the secret account, which was also used to finance undercover operations around the country. The Times revealed the existence of the bank account, which was connected to an investigation into cigarette smuggling, in February.

7. What looks like an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency may be a product of overuse of a test and misreading of its results.

8. After a long search, a comedian has agreed to perform at this year’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner, normally the glittering jewel of Washington’s social calendar.
Hasan Minhaj of “The Daily Show” will step up to the plate during a tense year marked by conflict between the new administration and the news media.
Mr. Trump is skipping the festivities, the first president to do so since the 1970s, and Vanity Fair and Bloomberg canceled their famed after-party.
9. Finally, in the best of late-night TV: On “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” John Stamos and Bob Saget, the former stars of “Full House,” remembered Don Rickles, the famed insult comedian who died last week.
And we looked at how Stephen Colbert has made the “The Late Show” great again.
