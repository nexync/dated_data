Iâ€™m in my 70s, with a straight back, a reasonably flat belly and most of my hair, albeit gray. As I entered a crowded subway car one evening at rush hour, I noticed an attractive young woman sitting near the door. Our eyes met, and she gave me a charming smile.
At which point she stood up and offered me her seat.
