STUTTGART, Germany — Maria Sharapova advanced to the quarterfinals of the Porsche Grand Prix by beating Ekaterina Makarova, 7-5, 6-1, on Thursday.
In her second match after a 15-month doping suspension, Sharapova hit nine aces and held serve throughout. She converted three of her four break points.
“Being in the quarterfinals here again is quite special,” said Sharapova, who won the event three times from 2012 to 2014.
Sharapova, who tested positive for the banned substance meldonium at last year’s Australian Open, held off the only break point for Makarova at 5-5, then broke Makarova in the next game to close out the opening set.
Sharapova was in control of the second throughout and wrapped up the win with two straight aces to raise her total for the tournament to 20. She improved to 7-0 against Makarova.
A five-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1, Sharapova lost her ranking because of the suspension and entered the event as a wild card. 
The upsets continued Thursday.Kristina Mladenovic upended the two-time defending champion Angelique Kerber, 6-2, 7-5, and Anastasija Sevastova beat sixth-seeded Johanna Konta, 6-3, 7-5.
Mladenovic won just one set in three previous matches against Kerber, ranked No. 2 in the world, but dominated large parts of the match.
Laura Siegemund, a finalist last year, defeated the 2009 champion, Svetlana Kuznetsova, 6-4, 6-3, and Carla Suárez Navarro beat Elena Vesnina, 6-2, 6-4.
