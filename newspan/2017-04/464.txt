In middle age, hip-hop has embraced nostalgia with ferocity. It is the soundtrack of several generations of young people now, some of whom are old enough to be wistful about how it used to be. For them, there’s comfort in reunion shows — last year, it was Bad Boy Records, and this year, it’s Ruff Ryders, the Yonkers crew that kept 1990s New York rap grounded in the streets while others flirted with pop.
The Ruff Ryders reunion, which comes to the Barclays Center on Friday, April 21, will feature the transfixing and troubled DMX, the slinky and sharp Eve, the producer-turned-art-collector Swizz Beatz, the bruisers the Lox, and others. If it achieves a fraction of the heights of the label’s 2000 tour (shared with the stars of Cash Money Records), the night will be rowdy and memorable.
