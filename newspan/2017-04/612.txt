“The Handmaid’s Tale,” Margaret Atwood’s cautionary fable, is adapted for the screen — and to our critic, it rings especially relevant. And “Gomorrah” begins a bloody second season as Neapolitan crime lords take it to the mat.
GOMORRAH 10 p.m. on SundanceTV. This operatically violent tale about the Camorra, a Neapolitan crime organization, is Italy’s most popular TV series, and it begins a second season with the Savastano family’s reign’s having seemingly come to an end. Now everyone wants a piece of what remains of the kingdom, particularly Ciro Di Marzio (Marco D’Amore) — once the right-hand man of Pietro Savastano, and now his bitter enemy — and his ruthless rival Salvatore Conte (Marco Palvetti), who believes that God has called to him to lead a new alliance.
LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT 9 p.m. on NBC. A news anchor makes an on-air accusation of rape against her boss.
BLACK-ISH 9 p.m. on ABC. The family that boogies down together: Bow’s polar-opposite sister, Santamonica (Rashida Jones), comes to town after filming a reality show and brings their brother (Daveed Diggs) and mother (Anna Deavere Smith) along for a dance-filled reunion.
BROCKMIRE 10 p.m. on IFC. Jules and Charles try to reignite Brockmire’s internet fame, but his new fan base (hello, Brooklyn!) turns out to be vastly different from his old one.
