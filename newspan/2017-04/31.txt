MEMPHIS — Mike Conley scored 31 points to lead the Memphis Grizzlies to a 101-88 victory over the short-handed Knicks on Friday night.
Courtney Lee led the Knicks with 16 points, while Maurice Ndour recorded a career-high 15. Justin Holiday finished with 12 points, and Willy Hernangomez had 11 points and 10 rebounds.
The Knicks, who played without Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis, lost for the third time in the past four games.
Conley was 12 of 17 from the field, including 7 of 11 from 3-point range, to lead six Grizzlies in double figures as Memphis ended a three-game losing streak and clinched the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. The Grizzlies will face the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs.
Wayne Selden scored a career-high 13 points and Vince Carter added 12, including three 3-pointers, as Memphis pulled away with a 16-2 run in the fourth quarter.
The Knicks went deep into their bench for the game. Derrick Rose was out after season-ending knee surgery, and Joakim Noah has been suspended. Anthony did not play because it was the second night of a back-to-back. Hopes of Porzingis returning were sidetracked when his sore lower back flared up.
The young Knicks were up to the challenge until the early stages of the fourth quarter as two shot-clock violations allowed Memphis to regain the lead.
The 16-2 run in the middle of the quarter, led by Carter’s three 3-pointers, extended the Grizzlies’ advantage to 96-80.
Memphis had a 12-point lead in the first half but was sluggish after the break, allowing the Knicks to pull even at 66 in the third quarter.
The Knicks led, 72-70, going into the fourth.
While the Grizzlies dominated the first half — Conley had 21 points — they only led by 6 points at the break, 53-47.
Memphis shot 53 percent in the first half mostly because of Conley, who converted 8 of 11 shots, including 5 of 7 from outside the arc.
