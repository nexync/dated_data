My friends Richard and Deirdre live outside London near Heathrow Airport. Apart from a few annoying planes flying over at odd hours, the setting is idyllic, with fields of wildflowers and tall grasses and trees, and a river flowing by.
A continuing project is the restoration of the old family manor, some part of which is always falling down, constantly being repaired and refurbished in their rather particular artistic style. Richard, an intrepid designer and jack-of-all-trades, is always happiest renovating. He turned their large sitting room into a spacious, tall, light-filled kitchen, the floor painstakingly covered in tiny white mosaic tiles. Elsewhere in the house, walls are rubbed with paints in hues of lime, indigo, turmeric or beet.
Deirdre, also intrepid, is known to all as a terrific cook. She is fast, organized and no-nonsense, known as much for her delicious food as for her unvarnished pronouncements and opinions.
Nonetheless, Richard persuaded Deirdre to prepare mushrooms on toast for their lunch the following day and filmed the entire procedure, sending it to me in short clips. “We haven’t got a toaster, so the toast is going to be made on the stovetop in a griddle pan,” she says. It’s clear she has no aversion to generously daubing the bread — thick slices from an Italian loaf, though she prefers a white sourdough — with olive oil, for toast that browns and crisps beautifully.
As the butter begins to sizzle, she commences to fry and stir the mushroom slices, tossing in another knob of butter for good measure. When they are nearly ready, a little chopped garlic and thyme are added and the heat is lowered, allowing the mushrooms to go juicy. “That’s all?” Richard asks. Deirdre sometimes adds a splash of Marsala or a little cream, but not today.
Warm plates, warm toast. The steaming mushrooms are spooned over them, and lunch is ready.
