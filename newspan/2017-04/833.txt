Good morning. I wrote about Jamie Oliver for the Eat column in The New York Times Magazine this week, and we published his recipe for chicken in milk to go with it. I hope you’ll read the column, then cook the recipe for dinner tonight. Jamie’s a good interview, and the chicken makes for astonishingly good eating.
For Tuesday, let’s try David’s recipe for spicy Thai pork tenderloin salad. And follow it up the next night with Melissa’s dead simple recipe for sheet-pan chicken, a classic of the one-pan dinner oeuvre.
And then you can round out the week with a classic old Moira Hodgson recipe for grilled salmon with lemon-herb marinade. We published it in 1996 and revisited it in your name. It’s legit remarkable. I think you will like.
You can find thousands of others recipes to cook this week on Cooking. Go search among them and save the ones you like to your recipe box, so you can find them easily when you’re ready to cook. You can, in fact, save recipes from anywhere on the web to your Cooking recipe box. Here’s how to do that.
Put stars on the recipes when you’re done cooking and leave notes if you’ve come up with a smart ingredient substitution or cooking hack. And, if you run into a jam with the technology or your kitchen work, do write for help. We monitor |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| as if we are Houston and you are on Apollo 13.
And if the great Norman Rush is writing about the great Teju Cole, “A Burning Collection,” for The New York Review of Books? You should read that, too, and seek out both their works, right away. Have a great week.
