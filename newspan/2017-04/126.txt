The Tony-winning actress Kelli O’Hara will take a short trip to the mystical world of “Brigadoon,” for a concert staging of the musical at City Center, the theater announced on Thursday.
The production will run from Nov. 15 to 19, beginning with a Nov. 15 gala performance in honor of the theater producer Stacey Mindich.
Steven Pasquale, who shared romantic duets with Ms. O’Hara in “The Bridges of Madison County” on Broadway, will play opposite her at City Center as well.
Christopher Wheeldon, who won a Tony for choreographing “An American in Paris,” which he also directed, will direct and choreograph the concert staging. Robert Fairchild, who leapt from the ballet stage to Broadway in “American in Paris,” will be part of the “Brigadoon” cast as well.
The 1947 musical, by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, centers on a pair of Americans in Scotland who discover a mystical village that appears for only one day every century.
A mainstay of the midcentury musical theater canon, it has fallen out of favor in recent decades. It has not had a full Broadway staging since 1981, though there was a major revival in 2014 at the Goodman Theater in Chicago.
