“By the Time It Gets Dark,” the second feature from the Thai director Anocha Suwichakornpong, tiptoes around an event in October 1976, when students at Thammasat University in Bangkok were violently suppressed while protesting the return of a military leader.
That context is never fully clarified in the movie, a continually mutating narrative that has little interest in providing bearings or telling a straightforward story, though we see the crackdown staged for a photo shoot, and the preparation for the protests in a flashback.
Ms. Suwichakornpong has suggested that “By the Time It Gets Dark” is a reflection on the impossibility of making a historical film. More directly, it seems to concern the difficulty of getting into another’s shoes.
In a baffling midpoint rupture, the movie abandons its principal characters and shifts focus to an actor (Arak Amornsupasiri). An earlier scene is restaged with different cast members. Another scene turns out to be a movie within the movie.
“By the Time It Gets Dark” has clearly been thought through, but it’s so cryptic that it cries out for, if not perfect explanations, perhaps footnotes. It’s so conceptual that it offers little for those not in sync.
