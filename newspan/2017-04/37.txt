Michele Roberts, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, has rebuked the Knicks’ president, Phil Jackson, for publicly indicating that he would like Carmelo Anthony to play elsewhere next season.
In a statement released late Saturday, Roberts said the union had taken its concerns about Jackson’s “inappropriate comments” to the commissioner’s office.
The Knicks declined to comment on Roberts’s statement. The league did not immediately comment Sunday.
Roberts’s remarks came after Jackson seemed to indicate that he hoped Anthony, 32, would waive the no-trade clause in his contract. Anthony has two years remaining on a five-year, $124 million deal.
The relationship between Anthony, a 10-time All-Star forward, and Jackson became uneasy this season after Jackson made public comments criticizing Anthony’s style of play.
Anthony’s future became a frequent topic of discussion as the Knicks floundered to a 31-51 record and missed the playoffs for a fourth consecutive season. They have yet to make the postseason with Jackson leading the franchise.
Anthony started 74 games and averaged 22.4 points and 5.9 rebounds this season. And while Jackson said Anthony would not fit into the kind of team he aimed to build, he also called Anthony a future Hall of Famer.
This was not the first time Jackson had been accused of breaking league rules. The N.B.A. fined him $25,000 in 2014 for tampering after he expressed interest in Derek Fisher as a head coaching candidate while Fisher was still playing in the postseason for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Jackson, then just a few months into his job with the Knicks, went on to hire Fisher as his head coach.
