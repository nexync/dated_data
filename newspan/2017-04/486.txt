As Turkey heads to a referendum on Sunday to expand the powers of the presidency, Turkish voters living abroad could play an important role in the outcome. In some European countries with large Turkish populations, tensions have been high recently: Officials from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s party, known in Turkey as the A.K.P., tried to campaign in Germany and the Netherlands and, when rebuffed, responded with a stream of harsh insults.
We asked Turks living overseas for their views on the election and received several hundred responses, both in favor of the changes and passionately against. Some readers said that the discord in Europe had affected their sense of identity as Turks in an adopted land. Others feared that their votes would be ignored or changed. What tied the responses together was a deep sense of impending change and worry over where Turkey was headed — wherever that might be.
