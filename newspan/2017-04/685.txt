Eugene Lang donated millions of dollars and enormous amounts of time and energy to transform the lives of thousands of low-income young people. His I Have a Dream Foundation helped smart but poor children get a college education and become doctors, scientists, teachers and entrepreneurs and enter many other professions.
Without him, many would have been denied a higher education and spent their lives in low-wage jobs.
Like Mr. Lang, whom I had the honor of knowing, other wealthy men and women (including the benefactor of the foundation I head) have used their fortunes to make higher education possible for students who couldn’t afford college. But their generosity is still not enough to make the educational dreams of every capable student become reality.
The agreement by the New York Legislature to approve Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s plan for tuition-free education at public colleges for many students is a good step forward, but more must be done by states, the federal government and colleges to make higher education accessible to all based on academic merit rather than parental wealth.
