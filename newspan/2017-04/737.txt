LeBron James had a triple-double, and the Cleveland Cavaliers set an N.B.A. postseason record by erasing a 25-point halftime deficit to beat the Indiana Pacers, 119-114, on Thursday night and take a three-games-to-none lead in a first-round series.
James had 41 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists, passing Kobe Bryant for third on the career playoff scoring list.
The incredible rally ruined a big night for Paul George, who had 36 points, a playoff career-high 15 rebounds and 9 assists for the Pacers.
Cleveland trailed by 74-49 at halftime. The largest halftime deficit overcome to win a playoff game had been 21 points by Baltimore against Philadelphia in 1948.
The Cavaliers will try to sweep the series on Sunday.
BUCKS ROUT RAPTORS Khris Middleton scored 20 points, and the host Milwaukee Bucks overwhelmed the Toronto Raptors, 104-77, to take a two-games-to-one lead in their first-round series. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 19 points and 8 rebounds, and Greg Monroe added 16 points for the Bucks, who built a 20-point lead in the first quarter.
Roman Josi scored twice, Pekka Rinne had 30 saves, and the Nashville Predators beat the visiting Chicago Blackhawks, 4-1, to complete a surprising sweep of the Western Conference’s top seed.
Colton Sissons also scored, and Viktor Arvidsson added an empty-net goal as Nashville recorded the franchise’s first playoff sweep. The Predators limited the Blackhawks to just three goals in 13 periods.
Nashville will face either St. Louis or Minnesota in the conference semifinals.
PENGUINS ADVANCE Sidney Crosby and Scott Wilson scored 51 seconds apart in the third period, and the Pittsburgh Penguins beat visiting Columbus, 5-2, to eliminate the Blue Jackets in Game 5 of their first-round series.
Bryan Rust had two goals, Phil Kessel also scored, and Marc-Andre Fleury had 49 saves for the Penguins, the defending Stanley Cup champions. Pittsburgh will face Toronto or Washington next.
SABRES CLEAN HOUSE The Buffalo Sabres fired General Manager Tim Murray and Coach Dan Bylsma after the youthful team missed the playoffs for a sixth consecutive season.
Chris Sale struck out 13 in eight shutout innings, Mookie Betts hit a three-run double in the 10th, and the Boston Red Sox beat the host Toronto Blue Jays, 4-1.
Sale allowed four singles and lowered his E.R.A. to 0.91. But he is just 1-1 because the team has scored only four runs for him in four starts.
