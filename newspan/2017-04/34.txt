• Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, the two French presidential candidates, received starkly different welcomes from striking factory workers in Amiens, Mr. Macron’s hometown.
Mr. Macron was booed as tires burned, while Ms. Le Pen was greeted with hugs and selfies.

• Viktor Orban, above, Hungary’s prime minister, clashed with European Union leaders in a continuing spat over a university founded by George Soros, the billionaire financier.

• For decades, parties on Europe’s far right have blamed E.U. institutions for being onerous bureaucracies and lacking democratic accountability.
At the same time, many populist leaders, including Ms. Le Pen, have enjoyed the perks of seats in the European Parliament. Even more ironic, the Parliament provides them with a platform to coordinate their anti-Europe efforts — and to get paid for it.
• Turkey detained more than a thousand police officers, accusing them of being “secret imams” for Fethullah Gulen, a cleric living in exile in the U.S.
The authorities blame him for the failed coup in July, which has since led to the arrests of about 45,000 people.
Turkey’s demand that Mr. Gulen be extradited is almost certain to be discussed at a meeting in Washington between President Trump and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, next month.

Tomorrow, Pope Francis will be visiting Egypt, the second trip by a modern pope to the biblical land, after John Paul II’s visit in 2000.
Francis is expected to meet another pope, one who is little known outside the country: Tawadros II of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Above, the two meeting at the Vatican in 2013.
Copts consider Tawadros II their 118th pope, after the apostle Mark is said to have established the church in Alexandria, in northern Egypt, in the first century.
The two churches parted ways in a dispute about the nature of Christ in the fifth century. It wasn’t until 1973 that a Coptic pope visited the Vatican, mending ties that had been severed for centuries.
Unlike his Roman Catholic counterpart, who is chosen by a group of cardinals, the Coptic pope is selected by a lottery that is said to incorporate the hand of God.
Crystal balls sealed with wax containing the candidates’ names were then taken to the St. Mark Cathedral in Cairo. There, a blindfolded 6-year-old boy in a white robe picked Tawadros’s name from a glass bowl.
