How Do I Buy My Sublet?
Q. I am subletting a one-bedroom in a Sutton Place co-op, which I love and would like to buy. The owner lives out of state and rarely uses it. Since he can sublet only two out of every five years, he won’t be able to rent it for three years after my lease expires, and the apartment needs a lot of work. I am preapproved for a mortgage large enough to buy this apartment. How can I persuade him to sell to me? Would he save on a broker’s fee? What about the board approval process? What else might persuade him?
A. You are in a good position to make an offer — assuming, of course, your landlord wants to sell. Remember, plenty of people own apartments in New York that they do not live in or even visit very often. If the owner hasn’t thought about selling, he might not know what the apartment is worth in today’s market. Unable to see its flaws or know how it compares to other recent sales, he “might have an unrealistic expectation in pricing,” said Joshua D. Arcus, the president of Siderow Residential Group, a real estate brokerage.
Be prepared to educate him on the market, but gently. The seller would certainly save money if he avoids paying a broker fee, typically around 6 percent of the purchase price. However, you still might want to speak with a broker, who could advise you about pricing and strategies for approaching a seller.
What else can you offer that another buyer cannot? An inside deal means he won’t have to list the apartment for sale, stage it or make any repairs. All these things take time, effort and money. If you have been a good tenant, your board application process would probably be relatively smooth, assuming your financial package meets expectations. Letters of recommendation from current residents would help.
All of these assets make you a desirable candidate. But if your landlord is not in the mood to sell, none of them will really matter.
