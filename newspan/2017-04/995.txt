‘IN & OF ITSELF’ at the Daryl Roth Theater (in previews; opens on April 12). Now you see him; now you … see him again. Derek DelGaudio, a magician somewhat more droll than most of the presto-chango set, had a hit a few years ago with the two-man magic act “Nothing to Hide.” He returns to New York with a new show, directed by Frank Oz, involving prestidigitation, mentalism and autobiographical vignettes.
‘PACIFIC OVERTURES’ at Classic Stage Company (in previews; opens on May 4). An ocean away, Classic Stage prepares for a revival of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman’s musical about Japan’s dawning modernization, directed by John Doyle and starring George Takei. Set in the mid-19th century, it advances toward the present in musical styles that borrow from both the East and West.
‘THE OUTER SPACE’ at Joe’s Pub (closes on April 9). Ethan Lipton’s solo sci-fi musical, directed by Leigh Silverman, imagines life light-years from the nearest bodega. Sly, grumpy and thumpingly humane, it tells the story of a couple trading gentrifying New York City for the grayer pastures of Mercury. But it’s less about getting away from it all than it is about getting over yourself. Listen in and lift off.
