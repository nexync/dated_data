Q. What is Duolingo and what do you do there?
A. We’re a free language-learning platform. We earn revenue by charging for language certification tests for individuals and businesses. Currently I code our new flashcard app, which we call Tinycards, and that part of our website.
My parents are from Taiwan; I’m a first-generation American. My dad is a mechanical engineer. As a kid, I would play educational computer games and design greeting cards for my friends on the computer, but I didn’t start programming until college. Initially I majored in chemical engineering at Princeton in the hope of attending medical school.
How did you come to major in computer science?
As part of the engineering school at Princeton, I was required to take an introductory computer science course, which was my first real introduction to the field. I fell in love with it and used my coding assignments to procrastinate when it came to other homework. I minored in neuroscience and engineering biology in case I might still want to be a doctor, but decided I should do what I love and switched my major.
I’ve been studying for a Ph.D. in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University since 2012. My adviser, Luis von Ahn, now our C.E.O., started Duolingo with a partner as a teaching project and asked me if I wanted to work on it along with other students. Now that I’ve finished my coursework and am writing my thesis, I work full time at the company.
You were honored for your work.
Last November I got to travel to Ireland with a colleague to meet the country’s president, Michael Higgins, who thanked us for keeping the Irish language alive. We attended a ceremony at the Irish White House with some of the volunteers who contributed to the courses.
When I was at Princeton, I was somewhat insecure because I started coding so much later than my classmates. I’ve proved that I belong in this field, I can succeed in it, and that when it comes to important decisions in the company, my voice matters.
