The opera star Renée Fleming and the violinist Joshua Bell — two musicians whose fame transcends classical music — will share the stage in “Time, Creativity and the Cosmos,” a multimedia spectacle to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the World Science Festival in New York.
The performance, on May 30 at Jazz at Lincoln Center, is among the more than 50 events in the festival, which runs from May 30 through June 4 and for the first time will stage events in Times Square.
The evening will feature performances by Ms. Fleming, Mr. Bell and the dance troupe Pilobolus. It will be directed by John Christian Plummer, who at last year’s festival directed “Awakening the Mind: A Celebration of the Life and Work of Oliver Sacks.” Ms. Fleming is performing in Strauss’s “Der Rosenkavalier” at the Metropolitan Opera through May 13.
At Times Square, the nexus for events scheduled for June 1-3, passers-by can expect free activities and installations — including “Holoscenes,” a performance piece about water and climate change by the artist Lars Jan and his company, Early Morning Opera. The work takes place in a 12-ton glass aquarium that will flood and drain over the course of five hours each day.
Other events, which include stargazing at Brooklyn Bridge Park and scientific demonstrations hosted by the actor Alan Alda, who supports science literacy, will be listed at worldsciencefestival.com.
