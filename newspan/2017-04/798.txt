Putting off your spring cleaning because you don’t have the right gear? We’re here to help. The Sweethome put together this helpful spring cleaning supplies guide with everything you’ll need.
A few favorite items include this vacuum (or maybe you’d prefer a cordless stick vacuum?), this dish soap, this broom, dustpan and dust mop, and this toilet brush, which was named Sweethome’s pick after more than 30 hours of research.
On the other hand, you could just pick up a robot friend to do your cleaning for you.
