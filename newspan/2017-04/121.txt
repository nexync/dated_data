After surviving 24 hours on his feet in Brooklyn (often in platform heels), the performance artist Taylor Mac is now taking his acclaimed “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music” on the road.
The show, a finalist for the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Drama, is a decade-by-decade walk through American history from 1776 to the present, told through the songs of the time, all reinterpreted through a radical queer lens. The roughly 700 people who saw the show in one continuous 24-hour marathon last October at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn will still have bragging rights. But audiences in San Francisco can see it in four segments presented between Sept. 15 and 24 at the newly restored Curran Theater there, followed by an abridged concert version at Stanford University on Sept. 27.
The entire show will be presented again next spring in six-hour segments at the Theater at Ace Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, from March 15 to 24. There will also be abridged performances at the Kennedy Center in Washington on March 6, 2018, and at Arizona State University in Tempe on April 7, 2018.
In addition to the Pulitzer nod, the show (produced by Pomegranate Arts) won the Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History.
Some of the elements, which include an adaptation of “The Mikado” set on Mars and what a news release calls “the queerest Civil War re-enactment in history,” will be restaged, depending on the design of each venue. But Mr. Mac, in a statement, said the San Francisco dates, in particular, represented a return to his roots.
