Kevin Spacey, a Tony-winning actor lately playing a nefarious president of the United States on Netflix’s “House of Cards,” will be the host of this year’s Tony Awards.
He served for more than a decade as the artistic director of the Old Vic Theater in London.
The Tony Awards, which each year honor plays and musicals presented on Broadway, will take place on June 11 at Radio City Music Hall. Much of the ceremony will be broadcast on CBS, starting at 8 p.m. (Some awards are bestowed before the telecast, or during commercial breaks.) The awards are presented by The Broadway League and the American Theater Wing.
He has won two Academy Awards, for “The Usual Suspects” in 1996 and for “American Beauty” in 2000.
This year’s awards will honor Broadway shows that have opened between April 29, 2016, and April 27, 2017. Nominations will be announced on May 2.
The award broadcast is an important marketing moment for Broadway, introducing many viewers to plays and musicals they may not yet be aware of.
And for the individual shows, it is an opportunity to reach a wide audience of potential ticket-buyers. Musicals often spend significant money developing elaborate production numbers for the broadcast.
