When Kori Ali Muhammad, a homeless man who voiced a hatred of white people and the government, learned on Tuesday morning that he was wanted in the killing of a Motel 6 security guard in Fresno, Calif., he decided he was going to kill again, the police said.
About 10:45 a.m., Mr. Muhammad walked up to a Pacific Gas & Electric utility truck and fatally shot a 34-year-old white employee in the passenger seat, the police said. He ran down another street and fired his handgun at another white person but missed. He reloaded.
Mr.  A witness said it sounded as if there was an altercation before three bullets were fired into the manâ€™s abdomen.
Mr. Muhammad ran away, stopping briefly to pick up bullets he dropped in the street, and, according to the police, fired his gun again when he spotted a white man outside Catholic Charities, the aid organization for homeless people and those in need.
