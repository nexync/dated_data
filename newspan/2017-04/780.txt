• Meet Duop. He was one of the 10,000-plus boys who've been toting rifles in South Sudan, some forced to fight as young as 10.
Duop is 16 now, give or take, and what he suffered seems to have robbed him of the ability to speak. Our correspondent went with him to see his mother for the first time in six years.
• And here lies Bukit Brown, one of the world’s largest Chinese cemeteries.
It’s just a few miles from central Singapore. Built in 1922, and now neglected, the 213-acre site packed with tombstones, statues and shrines has become a pilgrimage point for Singaporeans trying to reconnect with their country’s vanishing past.

• Finally, our new food writer, the Israeli-born British chef Yotam Ottolenghi, invited the Easter bunny to his Seder. So to speak.
In his latest column, he offers recipes for each holiday, and reflects on how a meal can be “the bridge between generations and the signifier of a story” that allows us to connect personally with history, and make our own.
Even a schoolchild can tell you that matter can exist as a solid, liquid or gas. But humanity’s hope for near-limitless, clean energy may hinge on a fourth state: plasma.
A giant plant now under construction in the south of France will be the testing ground, if the project’s partners — which include the European Union, the U.S., Russia and China — stay on course for billions of dollars of investment and a couple of decades of painstaking work.
The kind of plasma we’re talking about was named by an American scientist, Irving Langmuir, who saw a resemblance to blood plasma.
It emerges when energy is added to gas, leaving a cloud of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons zipping around. That’s what makes up the sun and other stars.
Under the right conditions, some superheated ions can fuse. And as they join, they shed a tiny amount of mass that translates into vast amounts of energy. Hence all that heat and light from the sun.
The French plant aims to create the right conditions by using magnetic fields to contain the plasma and radio waves and microwaves to make it unimaginably hot — and then see if human-created fusion will work.
