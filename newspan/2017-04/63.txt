When Kaija Saariaho’s “L’Amour de Loin” opened at the Metropolitan Opera in December, it was the first opera by a woman to be performed at the Met in 113 years. The work opened a discussion about the gender gap in classical music and other fields, and organizations such as Opera America and Prototype have recently made efforts to provide equal opportunities for female creators. Now Montclair State University in Montclair, N.J., is going a step further: Its upcoming Peak Performances season will entirely consist of new works by women. The lineup features premieres across music, theater and dance, including from the composer Ashley Fure, the choreographer Pam Tanowitz and the theater director Karin Coonrod.
The International Contemporary Ensemble will perform Ms. Fure’s “The Force of Things,” a new site-specific opera, Oct. 6-8. The opera is a collaboration with her brother, Adam Fure, and much of the music is played on objects such as bowls, cranks and tarps. On May 10-13, the cellist Maya Beiser will perform the world premiere of “Spinning,” by the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Julia Wolfe.
And Ms. Tanowitz will team up with the pianist Simone Dinnerstein for “New Work for Goldberg Variations,” a piece for piano and dancers set to Bach’s renowned compositions, on Oct. 19-22.
“The temper of the times demands a statement: there is no excuse for the remarkably slow progress toward gender parity in the arts,” Jedediah Wheeler, Peak Performances’ executive director, said in a statement.
