“Born in China,” another animals-are-just-like-people film from the Disneynature brand, has two of the natural world’s more adorable creatures in it, pandas and kitties. But some scraggly looking antelopes provide the most impressive imagery in a film that otherwise doesn’t stand out photographically.
The movie takes us all over China to see four species in their natural habitats, some of which are exceedingly remote. There are kitties — oh, all right; they’re snow leopards, a mother and two cubs. There’s a panda and her cub. There’s a young snub-nosed monkey that, at least in the irksome narrative imposed here, is feeling neglected because of the arrival of a baby sister.
A Tibetan antelope, or chiru, doesn’t get quite the screen time of these others — and isn’t even mentioned in some of the advance publicity for the movie — but footage of a long migration by the females of a herd to a calving ground and the arrival of a calf is among the most remarkable in the movie. Maybe that’s just because pandas and even the elusive snow leopard have become overexposed with the abundance of nature documentaries these days; this film looks pretty much like any of the best material to be found on the National Geographic Channel, PBS’s “Nature” and elsewhere.
In any case, the narrative, read by John Krasinski, is kid-friendly in a cloying sort of way, and unpleasant realities like China’s pollution are not mentioned. So as an introduction for children to exotic creatures in picturesque landscapes, the movie is harmless enough.
