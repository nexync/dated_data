Thousands of firefighters gathered near St. Martin of Tours church in Bethpage, N.Y., on Long Island, on Thursday for the funeral of a New York City firefighter, William N. Tolley. Mr. Tolley, 42, died after falling from the roof of a five-story building in Ridgewood, Queens, a week ago.
The Fire Department and federal officials are investigating the cause of the accident, a process that could take months. But experienced fire officials and equipment experts said the accident highlighted the dangers of working high above the street.
