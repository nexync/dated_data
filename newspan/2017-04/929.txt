Ballet dancers come in all shapes and sizes — proportion is what really matters. But mental strength and resolve? They come from within. The giveaway that children have a sliver of the commitment required for the arduous path of a dance career reveals itself, funnily enough, not in their movement but in their stillness. Of the aspirants waiting their turn sitting against a mirror or standing rigidly as a ballet teacher checks legs for turnout and extension, it’s the quiet ones who stop you in your tracks.
Each spring, the School of American Ballet, formed in 1934 by Lincoln Kirstein and George Balanchine as the official academy of New York City Ballet, holds free community auditions for children ages 6 to 10 in Chinatown, Harlem, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens. No experience is necessary, and boys, if accepted, attend free. (It’s still a man’s world, even in ballet.) The final round will be held at Brooklyn Friends School on Saturday.
What have these community auditions done for the school? Diversity is no longer an aspiration, but an ever-growing reality. During the winter session, minority students made up 38 percent of the overall student body and 44 percent of the children’s division.
For these kids, it’s still early days. The journey to becoming a professional ballet dancer is long and difficult, but at the audition, that journey is a dance on the diagonal. The children are asked to skip or to perform a step — essentially, to determine how well they listen and move to music. Suddenly, you see the adult in the child: the nerves and fearlessness, the vulnerability and determination are all out in the open. It’s humanity on a diagonal.
