At least five people were killed in Texas on Saturday afternoon when a series of tornadoes tore through rural counties east of Dallas, the authorities said.
The tornadoes touched down around 5 p.m. and left a broad trail of damage, tossing cars, knocking down trees and power lines, and flattening homes. The city of Canton and the surrounding area in Van Zandt County, about 60 miles east of Dallas, appeared to be the hardest hit.
Capt. Brian Horton of the Canton Fire Department said late Saturday that five people had been killed and dozens were injured. “What we do know is that it is very severe,” Captain Horton said at a news conference.
He said some people remain unaccounted for and that search-and-rescue teams from across Texas were on their way to assist. The death toll will most likely rise on Sunday, when the authorities are better able to survey the damage, Captain Horton said.
Scores of people from the counties of Van Zandt, Henderson and Rains were taken to hospitals in East Texas. A spokeswoman for the East Texas Medical Center Regional Healthcare System said its hospitals received 55 patients, but only one person was in critical condition.
A school in Canton and another in the city of Fruitvale were set up as triage centers to accept injured people, the authorities said.
The National Weather Service reported that three tornadoes touched down. The tornado that hit Canton appeared to start southwest of the city and traveled more than 40 miles northeast to Emory.
