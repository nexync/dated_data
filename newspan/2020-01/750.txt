The 23-year-old British actor is making his mark in the United States.
Hometown: Born in Los Angeles and raised in Southampton, England.
Now lives: When he is not shooting (he is currently filming in Vancouver, British Columbia), he lives with his family in a “small and quaint” home in Southampton.
 In Britain, he is best known for starring in “Killed by My Debt,” a TV film based on the true story of a young courier who killed himself when two traffic tickets grew into a soul-crushing debt.
In the United States, he is known for playing a pansexual warlock on “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina,” a Gen Z spin on the Sabrina the Teenage Witch universe.
Big break: After graduating from Peter Symonds College in Winchester, where one of his majors was theater, he landed a small part on an episode of “Hetty Feather,” a British children’s drama set in the Victorian era. It was “one or two lines,” Mr. Perdomo said, but it was enough “to take that leap of faith” and pursue acting full time.
Next thing: The third season of “Sabrina” will be released on Netflix this month. Beyond the show’s spooky cloaks and daggers, he hopes new episodes will allow viewers to continue probing the sexually fluid sorcerer he plays onscreen.
