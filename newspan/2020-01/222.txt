The spray coating on these dials is said to be the darkest material on the planet.

A new limited-edition watch has a tourbillon swirling in what appears to be a deep, infinite black hole. But, in fact, the mesmerizing dial is covered with what the National Physical Laboratory, Britain’s measurements standards institute, has verified as the darkest material on Earth.
A friend, Pierre Jacques of the De Bethune watch company, told him about the material, generically called carbon nanotube film — and Mr. Meylan reached out to Surrey NanoSystems. In 2015, Surrey’s chief technical officer, Ben Jensen, finalized a spray-on version of the substance he had trademarked as Vantablack.
The coating used on the Moser watch is Vantablack S-VIS, which Mr. Jensen described as the blackest spray-applied coating commercially available today and the same coating used on instruments for space travel to protect them from sunlight.
“Moser ships us the dials and we treat them,” Mr. Jensen said. “It’s very complicated.” And costly.
The new watch, introduced in December, was the Endeavour Tourbillon Concept Vantablack, a limited edition of 50 selling for $75,000 each. It was the latest in a line that began in fall 2018 with the Endeavour Perpetual Moon Concept, a limited edition of 50 that sold out at $35,000 each. “It looked like a black hole with the moon floating in it,” Mr. Meylan said. “We could have sold hundreds of them.” Then came the simpler (“it’s not a limited edition and there are no special complications”) Venturer Concept Vantablack for $27,600 and a version of the Venturer with each watch containing 313 diamonds totaling 3.77 carats and selling for $54,000.
