A nontraditional take on Wagner’s “The Ring” retells the magical saga as a country and western tale at Hill Country Barbecue.
Trade the magic Tarnhelm for a Stetson. On Site Opera, a company that interprets operas in nontraditional venues, takes “The Ring” to Texas as a country-and-western tale, complete with Siegfried, the Rhinestone cowboy, in “Das Barbecü.” The production, with music by Scott Warrender riffing on Richard Wagner’s themes, lyrics by Jim Luigs and a cast that includes singers from New York City Opera and Broadway runs about 2 1/2 hours. It includes a family-style barbecue dinner of brisket, chicken, mac and cheese, cornbread and desserts.
“Das Barbecü” by On Site Opera, Hill Country Barbecue Market, 30 West 26th Street, downstairs, 7:30 p.m., Sundays through Tuesdays, Jan. 26 through Feb. 11, $95 at tables, $60 at the bar, plus beverages, osopera.org.
