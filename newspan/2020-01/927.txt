How do you do it? What have you learned?
When Laura Vanderkam started sharing the news that she was pregnant with her 5th child, she was startled by some of the reactions. “People are fascinated by large families,” Laura wrote in a piece for NYT Parenting, both because they’re increasingly rare and, she began to suspect, they assume “[we] have the maddening logistics of 21st-century child-rearing all figured out.” As Laura and her family prepared to welcome baby Henry (who arrived on Dec. 29), she sought advice from experienced moms and dads with big families. Now, we want to continue the conversation. If you’re a parent of five or more children, has your approach to raising kids changed as your family has grown? What do you wish more people understood about the joys and struggles of being the biggest family on the block? And, how do you answer that very common question: How do you do it?
