Corrections that appeared in print on Sunday, Jan. 12, 2020.
An article on Oct. 13 about the use of images from the photo-sharing site Flickr in facial-recognition technology misstated a goal of the CyberPatriot program. It encourages young people to pursue careers in fields like cybersecurity, not just careers in intelligence and the military. This correction was delayed, because the error was only recently brought to the editors’ attention.
The With Interest column last Sunday overstated the net worth of the businessman Carlos Ghosn. He is a multimillionaire, not a billionaire.
The New & Noteworthy column on Dec. 29 misstated the available format and price for “Race Man,” by Julian Bond. The book is available in paperback, not hardcover. And it is listed for $22.95, not $24.95.
