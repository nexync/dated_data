The madness of prohibiting solar panels on the rooftops of historic buildings illustrates how preservation culture has run amok.
Mr. Appelbaum is a member of the Editorial Board.
I live in a historic neighborhood in the heart of Washington, D.C. It’s not historic in the sense that anything especially important happened here — certainly not in the modest rowhouses that make up the bulk of the neighborhood. What “historic” means, here and in cities across the country, is that this is a neighborhood where buildings are not supposed to change.
The law says window frames on Capitol Hill must be wooden, or something that looks very much like wood. If a front door has two parts and opens down the middle, it cannot be replaced by a single door that swings open from the side. If the house was built two stories tall, it must remain two stories tall — unless the addition can’t be seen from the street.
Humans don’t like change, so it’s not surprising that historic preservation laws have become quite popular. There are now more than 2,300 local historic districts across the United States, and I know many people who would like to have their own neighborhood frozen in time.
But historic preservation comes at a cost: It obstructs change for the better. And while that price is generally invisible, it is now on public display because of the city’s efforts to prevent Washington homeowners in historic neighborhoods from installing visible rooftop solar panels.
As you may have heard, Earth is getting hotter because we’re burning too much carbon, and one small way people can reduce their use of carbon is to tap the sun for electricity.
The board, however, decided it was more important to keep Mr. Preister’s roof looking as it did 100 years ago.
I am well aware that installing solar panels on every house in Washington — or even in the United States — would not suffice to make a significant dent in the pace of global warming.
And it should be noted that after Mr. Preister’s failure caused an uproar, the city announced changes that make it a little easier to win permission to put solar panels on historic homes. Mr. Preister finally won permission after promising to spend some $1,300 on camouflage.
But the fact that Washington continues to impose any aesthetic restrictions on rooftop solar panels is still a problem — and it is emblematic of the broader problems with preservation.
There are buildings that should be preserved because of their historic, cultural or aesthetic significance. But there aren’t many. The list certainly doesn’t include all 8,000 buildings in the Capitol Hill Historic District.
Historic preservation, in practice, is not about preserving history. It is about preserving the lifestyle of an affluent urban elite.
We are placing large chunks of our cities under glass, preventing what should be some of our most vibrant neighborhoods from growing and changing as the country grows and changes.
If people were interested in preserving history, he said, they should preserve everything: The pretty and ugly houses; grande olde theatres and strip malls. He suggested, tongue in cheek, that cities should be sliced into strips, with everything in one strip preserved and everything in the next open for development.
That’s not how we do it, of course.
Homes in Washington’s historic districts are modern on the inside. Cable lines run between houses, cars are parked on the streets, and the government has set aside the deed restrictions that in some neighborhoods once barred ownership by blacks, Jews and other minorities. What is being preserved are the facades of the houses — and the scale of development.
The necessary corrective is not to demolish existing buildings, but to allow most existing buildings to be changed over time, and to allow new buildings to grow up alongside.
American cities should borrow a page from Britain, where protected buildings are placed in categories, from most to least important. In my neighborhood, the Capitol is an obvious example of a building that deserves full protection. Perhaps the local Carnegie library belongs in an intermediate category. But houses, with rare exceptions, are not historically significant. Residential historic districts mostly serve to protect property values, and the government should stop privileging that goal over other values like access to affordable housing. Or the value of trying something new. Or, say, the value of doing something to slow global warming and preserve a habitable planet.
