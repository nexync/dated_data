After the fatal crashes of two 737 Max jets, regulators asked whether safety had been compromised in a rush to compete. Then whistle-blowers raised wider concerns.
This week, “The Daily” is revisiting some of our favorite episodes of 2019 and checking in on what has happened since they first appeared.
Today, we return to our conversation with the whistle-blower John Barnett, known as Swampy, about what he said were systemic safety problems at Boeing. After two 737 Max jet crashes killed 346 people and a federal investigation left the company in crisis, we ask: Is something deeper going wrong at the once-revered manufacturer?
Natalie Kitroeff, a business reporter for The New York Times, spoke with John Barnett, a former quality manager at Boeing.
Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, testified before Congress to face questions about the crashes of two 737 Max jets that killed 346 people.
Before we start today, I’d like to speak directly to the families of the victims who are here with us. On behalf of myself and the Boeing company we are sorry, deeply and truly sorry. As a husband and father myself, I’m heartbroken by your losses. I think about you and your loved ones every day. And I know our entire Boeing team does, as well. I know that probably doesn’t offer much comfort and healing at this point. But I want you to know that we carry those memories with us every day.
Boeing successfully lobbied to reduce government oversight of airplane designs, allowing it to regulate faulty engineering internally.
