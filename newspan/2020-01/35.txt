Cecilia Mangini made a splash in 1958 with a movie about disaffected Roman teenagers. Her latest, drawing on material from North Vietnam in the mid-1960s, will be released this weekend.
Ms. Mangini was born in Mola di Bari, in the southern Italian region of Puglia, in 1927. But her family moved to Florence when she was 6, after her father, a leather salesman, suffered financial setbacks. After high school and a short stint in college, she moved to Rome in 1952 and began working as the organizer of the Italian federation of film clubs. There she met and fell in love with Mr. Del Fra, who was also part of the association.
Ms. Mangini’s name recognition grew after she started appearing as a commentator on a political talk show. “As a guest she’s unique because she unites authoritativeness, lucidity, historical memory but also great charm and empathy,” said Giovanni Floris, the show’s host. “She has a brilliant take on things, and she is part of the country’s cultural history,” which the show’s public respects, he said.
