The musician’s youngest son, Sam Springsteen, was sworn in as a Jersey City firefighter on Tuesday.
If there’s a fire in Jersey City or a cat stuck in a tree, there’s a good chance that Bruce Springsteen’s son may be dispatched to the scene.
Sam Springsteen was one of 15 new firefighters who were sworn in Tuesday by Mayor Steven M. Fulop of Jersey City and the director of public safety, James Shea.
Bruce Springsteen, the rock star whose songs have for decades celebrated New Jersey’s working class, and Patti Scialfa, his wife and longtime bandmate, looked on and clapped as their youngest son joined the newest members of the city’s Fire Department, according to TV news coverage of the ceremony.
Mr. Springsteen graduated from the Monmouth County Fire Academy in January 2014, according to an Instagram post by Ms. Scialfa. He also worked as a volunteer firefighter in Colts Neck, the New Jersey township where he grew up, according to NBC.
The new recruits bring the number of uniformed firefighters and superiors to 666, a historic high for the city, according to a news release by Mayor Fulop. The new class of firefighters trained at the Morris County Public Safety Training Academy, a county spokesman said. In all, Jersey City has 26 firehouses.
“Our fire department responds to 1,300 fires a year, which is why these 15 recruits have gone through rigorous training necessary to be part of the best fire department this city has ever seen,” Mayor Fulop said in a statement.
He also posed for photos with the Springsteen family and posted them on Twitter.
