Rampant inequality, anti-immigration politics, tariffs — hell, impeachment, even! To read Richard White’s THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS: The United States During Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, 1865-1896 is to come across an unnerving doppelgänger. It chronicles the particular national sins of the late 19th century — the rapacious violence toward the Native Americans, the tragic abandonment of Reconstruction — but even topics one might expect to find remote have the ring of recognition. The railroad tycoons seem right out of Silicon Valley, and the deep cynicism of the era would take effortless root on Twitter. It would be nice to report a reassuring lesson in all this, but for many thousands in the Gilded Age, like the steelworkers whose strike was crushed just across the river from where I live in Pittsburgh, the endings were anything but happy.
