Kristen Stewart is lean, intense and taciturn in this aquatic “Alien” attempt. But the movie is more boring than horrific.
Early on in this mercifully short horror picture, a crew member — one of a handful trapped nearly seven miles beneath the ocean in a collapsing futuristic oil rig — wrests from the sea an aggressive, super-gnarly-looking creature, which he brings to show the gang. “Oh no,” a viewer might think, “you never bring the gnarly-looking thing back on the ship. Has no one in this movie seen ‘Alien?’” Maybe, maybe not, but it doesn’t matter, as the thing doesn’t get to do much in that moment.
Welcome to the world of “Underwater,” a movie whose own sea legs are so wobbly, you’re never quite sure whether that weak fake-out was even deliberate. Directed by William Eubank from a script by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, it tries to establish some “Alien”-of-the-deep bona fides with its lead, Kristen Stewart, being lean, taciturn and intense in the opening scene. Stewart may well be as consequential a screen actress as Sigourney Weaver, but dreck like this isn’t going to build a comparable filmography.
The crew member who finds the gnarly thing is played by T.J. Miller. The film wrapped before his brush with the law . While this may have contributed to the movie’s long shelving, Miller’s hardly the only problem here.
Rated PG-13 for gnarly looking things and bass-boosted shock scares. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes.
