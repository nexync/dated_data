Her copy of the sixth printing of the book, from 1921, has been donated to the library of the Mount, her home in Lenox, Mass.
Edith Wharton kept restlessly editing her best sellers even through numerous print runs. In 1921, she finished fine tuning “The Age of Innocence” upon its sixth printing and tucked one edition onto the shelves at her chateau in Southeastern France.
That copy, with her signature and bookplate, has resurfaced in time for the centennial of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. It has been donated to the library at another of her palatial homes, the Mount, a museum in Lenox, Mass.
The “Age of Innocence” copy, a gift from the book collector Dennis Kahn, will be unveiled on Jan. 24, Wharton’s 158th birthday. Mr. Kahn bought it from the book dealer Sarah Baldwin in 2002 for $2,500 (it was recently appraised at $12,500). Wharton aficionados “don’t know how it escaped” from the writer’s library, Mr. Kahn said.
Wharton gave away books, including signed volumes for charities to sell, and her heirs scattered others. More than 1,000 nonfiction volumes that she owned were destroyed during a World War II bombing while stored in London. Another portion of her library, preserved at a castle in Kent, England, was cataloged and assembled by the British bookseller George Ramsden and acquired by the Mount in 2005.
Mr. Kahn’s gift bears the bookplate of a Wisconsin businessman and philanthropist, Norman D. Bassett, who died in 1980 at 89; Mr. Bassett had collected autographed books since he met Mark Twain as a teenager. Nynke Dorhout, the Mount’s librarian, said, “We are still researching the Bassett connection” to flesh out the provenance.
