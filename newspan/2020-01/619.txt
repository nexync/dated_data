This 8,070-square-foot building in Hellâ€™s Kitchen has nine two-bedroom apartments; one retail space, occupied by 5 Brothers Gourmet Market; and a basement. The seller had owned the building, which also has about 2,500 square feet of available air rights, since the early 1990s.
Rooted Innovations, a food business based in Dublin that focuses on plant-based products and sustainability, has secured a seven-year lease for a 2,500-square-foot space on the fourth floor of this building in the Flatiron district. Built in 1925, the five-story property, which overlooks Madison Square Park, used to be a family residence.
Built in 1919, this one-story building in Bushwick used to house a discount clothing store. The property is 8,940 square feet, and the owner has approval for a 14-story hotel and residential development on the site. The seller anticipates that the project will be completed 18 to 24 months after the sale.
Built last year, this 15,946-square-foot building is in the Woodstock neighborhood. The seven-floor building has 24 apartments, a mix of studios and one-bedrooms, all occupied. There is an elevator, and seven parking spaces are in the rear.
