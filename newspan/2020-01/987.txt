This country-western parody of the operatic epic is set amid dining tables at a Manhattan barbecue restaurant.
With its weighty music and complex symbolism; its tangled story of gods, greed and magic; and its epic length, Wagner’s “Ring” cycle has invited parodies from the start.
All kinds of comics have taken the bait. In the classic cartoon “What’s Opera, Doc?,” Elmer Fudd chortles “Kill the wabbit” to the “Ride of the Valkyries” melody as he pursues Bugs Bunny. The comedian Anna Russell’s droll summary of the convoluted plot of the “Ring,” in which she sings excerpts at the piano, is still priceless after nearly 70 years.
Many Wagner devotees actually enjoy a good “Ring” satire, perhaps because we admit that, however compelling, its giants, river maidens and dwarfs are a little laughable.
The best thing about “Das Barbecü” — a musical theater piece with book and lyrics by Jim Luigs and music by Scott Warrender, first presented in 1991 by the Seattle Opera — is that it tries to be more than just a parody. Wagner’s story is reset deep in the heart of Texas, with Wotan as a powerful rancher, Siegfried as a guitar-strumming cowboy, and Brünnhilde as a sassy cowgirl.
On Sunday the enterprising On Site Opera company, which presents scaled-down versions of works in site-specific settings, opened a run of “Das Barbecü” in an ideal location: Hill Country Barbecue Market in Chelsea. Five singers portrayed the 30 characters, including most of those who appear in Wagner’s original and a few additions, like some rangers and busybodies. The production, directed by Eric Einhorn and Katherine M. Carter, certainly captured the piece’s manic energy.
But now and then, this “Barbecü” drew out the affecting emotional strands of Wagner’s cycle in playful or poignant ways. If only more had been made of these moments, by both the creators and the cast. For example, there’s a scene in Act II when Siegfried (the dynamic David Hughey) is cuddling with Brünnhilde (the bright-voiced Jessica Fishenfeld) on Mesa Rock, the fire-surrounded mountain atop which her father had placed her years before.
I wish Mr. Luigs and Mr. Warrender had aimed higher and gone deeper with their insights into the “Ring.” As it is, “Das Barbecü” is bent on giving the audience a good time. And with the singers sliding between rows of dining tables, the audience certainly gets mixed up in the fun. The main problem is that the work, running over two hours, feels padded. There are way too many songs, some of them light and slick. It’s a classic case of a piece that would be twice as good if it were half as long.
One running story line pits Brünnhilde against Gutrune (the lively Justine Aronson) as rivals for the confused Siegfried, who eventually realizes he has pledged to marry them both. Decked up in cowgirl-bridal tulle, Gutrune seems the more formidable of the smitten women, by far. At the same time, Brünnhilde is being foisted on Hagen (Mr. Mason), portrayed as a narcoleptic brute who’s haunted by his father, Alberich (Mr. Hughey).
The two women see Siegfried and Hagen as typical Texas-two-timing men. But the guys, in a resonant moment, try to make it clear that Gutrune and Brünnhilde might actually like each other, if they gave it a chance. Again, some suggestion of the women’s mutual understanding also comes through in Wagner.
There are enjoyably antic bits, as when the three future-telling Norns, wielding pieces of their broken rope, sing a trio offering sage advice to women to “hogtie your man.” But the rare moments when the characters turn inward stand out, like the reflective song Brünnhilde delivers at a country fair, musing that a man cannot be counted on.
Though the show is way overextended, patrons can watch while sitting at the bar or, better yet, dining at a table. And the brisket, roast chicken, mac and cheese and cornbread are worth it.
