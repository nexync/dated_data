The final season of “Schitt’s Creek” debuts on Pop TV, and a special “Jeopardy!” tournament begins on ABC.
JEOPARDY!: THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME 8 p.m. on ABC. This is the moment “Jeopardy!” fanatics have been waiting for. The show’s three record-breaking contestants — Ken Jennings, Brad Rutter and James Holzhauer — will compete in a series of one-hour shows airing over several nights. The first to win three matches walks away with $1 million and the title “greatest of all time.” The runners-up will each receive $250,000. Holzhauer captivated viewers last year by setting the record for the most money won during one game ($110,914), and then surpassing it three more times. He became a minor celebrity, and the special tournament allows the show to ride the wave of the popularity of all three contestants.

Soon, Zoey starts to hear the thoughts and secrets of those around her in the form of pop songs. The catch? Only she can see and hear the musical numbers. In this pilot episode, Zoey tries to determine whether her new ability is a blessing or a curse. She gets something of an answer when her father (Peter Gallagher), who has a rare neurological disease that has left him immobile and unable to communicate, comes alive through the music.
