This fact-based story directed by Todd Robinson follows the quest to get a Medal of Honor for a pararescue medic who died in Vietnam.
When in a movie a harried, cynical, pencil-pushing government bureaucrat is saddled with an assignment he doesn’t want, during a crisis in his employment, you know how it’s going to go. Just as in a Hallmark movie where the overextended urban single woman gets lured out to a distant aunt’s rural bed-and-breakfast, there are going to be some life changes.
In the fact-based film “The Last Full Measure,” Sebastian Stan plays Scott Huffman, a Department of Defense legal cog solicited by a Vietnam veteran (William Hurt) to pursue a Medal of Honor for a fallen colleague, an Air Force pararescue medic named William H. Pitsenbarger. Initially inclined to shrug the case off, Huffman speaks to Pitsenbarger’s parents, played by Christopher Plummer and Diane Ladd, and to the soldiers he saved, a traumatized group that includes one who has been sitting on a secret for over 30 years. (The film’s action is mostly set in 1999, with flashbacks to Vietnam in 1966.) Huffman becomes a believer, then a crusader.
The movie is written and directed, with undeniable sincerity, by Todd Robinson. While its story mechanics are creaky, the valor of Pitsenbarger is evoked cogently, in well-executed battle sequences. And not one soul in the stellar cast, which also includes Samuel L. Jackson, Ed Harris, Amy Madigan and, in one of his last screen roles, Peter Fonda, chooses to phone it in.
Indeed, the raw pain that Hurt dredges up in the movie’s last quarter constitutes some of the most wrenching acting he’s ever done. And Plummer and Ladd are practically magisterial as parents whose lifelong grief has come to define, but not overwhelm, them. These performers cut through the swelling music and sometimes cloying earnestness to put across some valuable emotional truths.
Rated R for grisly scenes of warfare. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes.
