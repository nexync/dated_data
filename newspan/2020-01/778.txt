A viral tweet about picking a seat on New York’s subway prompted a spirited debate over which spot is prized.
It is a subconscious decision that New Yorkers face every day: entering a subway train and making a split-second judgment about which seat to grab.
The choice is primal and depends on a series of calculations, including the length of your trip and the body language of the people seated nearby.
In the photo, a group of seats on a D train, in a cascade of orange hues, is labeled with a number, from 1 to 5.
A fiery debate soon erupted. The seat next to the door (No. 1), some proclaimed. The one by the window tucked safely out of harm’s way (No. 4). Definitely not the middle seat (No. 2), everyone agreed.
“Anyone who doesn’t say 1 should be arrested by the M.T.A. Police,” the television writer Bess Kalb responded.
Even Andy Byford, the subway’s leader, weighed in, noting that a true gentleman stands.
Mayor Bill de Blasio weighed in late on Thursday, speaking for tall people everywhere and shunning the seats with little legroom.
Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. de Blasio’s predecessor and a regular subway rider, agreed with Mr. Byford that standing was the best option.
“I always stand,” Mr. Bloomberg posted on Twitter, alongside a photo of him reading a newspaper on the train, although he was committing his own etiquette lapse by blocking the door.
Other riders had more practical concerns.
“Whichever one isn’t inexplicably wet,” the comedian Mike Drucker wrote.
One rider complained that the seat closest to the door could inspire a robbery. “I call that one the snatch and run,” he said of seat No. 1.
Mr. Bautista, 20, said his train was empty on New Year’s Eve because he gets on at the first D stop in the Bronx. He was home for the holidays from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
Mr. Bautista struggled to select a seat on the train on Thursday morning, ultimately choosing the seat near the aisle where he could sit sideways.
The train in the photo is an R68 model, which is used on the A, B, D, G, N, Q and W lines, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees the subway. About 625 of the cars are currently in service.
Other models have different layouts, like the loathed R32 cars, which are among the oldest in the world. Those breakdown-prone cars have a long bench on either side, where riders often exchange perturbed glances over invisible boundaries because seats are not marked.
The subway seat debate started the same day that Mr. Byford, the subway leader, touched off another viral post on Twitter when the official subway account referred to him as “Train Daddy,” a new nickname that has made New Yorkers chuckle.
The subway Twitter account posted photos of Mr. Byford greeting riders on New Year’s Eve and thanking employees for working on the holiday.
Mr. Byford, a cheerful British native, has become a bit of a cult figure in New York as he has worked to improve subway service over the last two years.
