“You can probably sing much better than you think you can,” says Bryan E. Nichols, an assistant professor of music at Pennsylvania State University and director of the Pitch Exploration Lab. Many people believe they’re unable to sing in tune, but less than 2 percent of the population exhibits true amusia, or the inability to identify pitch changes in music. If you can hear pitch shifts, you can vocalize them. Think of singing not as some rarefied talent but as part of being human — something most bodies can just do, like walking.
One root cause of this widespread lack of vocal confidence is the simple fact that some of the most common American songs are just plain hard. Take, for example, the national anthem. Or “Happy Birthday,” which starts off easy enough but then lurches up a full octave in the third phrase, landing on a note that is too high for many singers, who often respond by shifting to a lower key midsong. It’s rarely pretty. Students in Nichols’s lab call their research the Happy Birthday Club. Choose a different song to sing, one you like, in a range that feels comfortable for your voice.
Practice listening to and then mimicking a note, what’s called “pitch matching.” Listen, take a breath, hear the note in your head and then try to sing it, crisply, without drifting up or down to get there. Feedback from a teacher or even just a pitch app on your phone can help. “Perfect pitch isn’t required for good singing,” Nichols says. Some of the most moody, haunting songs involve notes that are slightly off on purpose, like jazz’s semitone lower blue notes or a vocal technique called “scooping,” in which you begin flat and slide upward into the desired note.
