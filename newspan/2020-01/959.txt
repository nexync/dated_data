Jeff writes: My wife calls jogging my “me time,” even though I get up at 5 a.m. to do it. Usually my family is asleep when I leave. But I get the stink eye if our kids wake up before I get home. Still, I think of “me time” as reading or having a beer and watching TV — not exercise.
Who else’s time could it possibly be? It’s your hobby. If you were getting up at 5 and ignoring your kids to do jigsaw puzzles or work on your Iron Man rig for Comic Con, I trust you would have the grace to accept the stink eye you deserve. Running has obvious physical and mental health benefits, but so does my hobby — napping — and it’s just as solitary. True, your wife may prefer your physique to mine; but she also desires your body in other ways, such as in the house more. So do keep jogging. You deserve your me time!  Jogging is just as much a hobby as cosplay, only it’s somehow even sweatier.
