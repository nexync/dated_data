The investigative journalist Andrea Bernstein’s first book, “American Oligarchs: The Kushners, the Trumps and the Marriage of Money and Power,” traces the origin of the myths about the two families. On this week’s podcast, she talks about her work, including why she thinks influence in government exists in ways we haven’t seen since the Gilded Age.
David Zucchino visits the podcast to discuss his new book, “Wilmington’s Lie,” about the brutal overthrow of the multiracial government of Wilmington, N.C., in 1898.
Also on this week’s episode, Lauren Christensen, Gregory Cowles and John Williams talk about what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
