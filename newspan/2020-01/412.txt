Leaders of several organizations say President Trump’s threat to destroy Iranian sites would be a war crime and contrary to American policy. Also: Marrying a former partner for the second time.
President Trump has threatened retaliation against Iran by striking Iranian sites including “some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.” If carried out, this threat would constitute a war crime under international instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, which the United States has joined. The American military has a proud history of avoiding intentional damage to and destruction of cultural sites, which began with President Abraham Lincoln’s law of war manual, known as the Lieber Code.
Cultural heritage represents the record of our shared human achievement, the surviving remains from the past and the places that are sacred to the present. Protected cultural sites include religious and historic structures, cemeteries, libraries, archives, museums and archaeological sites.
The Department of Defense Law of War Manual specifically prohibits “acts of hostility … directed against cultural property” in the absence of military necessity. Now, the president is threatening to target cultural sites in Iran whose rich cultural heritage spans from the earliest evidence of human domestication of plants and animals to ancient majestic Achaemenid cities and richly tiled Islamic shrines and mosques. Iran is home to 24 World Heritage Sites and thousands of other places that are part of our global shared heritage.

Their story was so sweet, it brought tears to my eyes. I’ve been married for 53 years, and their drifting apart and reconnecting made perfect sense to me. After a long marriage, you can always find your way back because you have both grown up together.
The memories they shared represent their entire lives.
