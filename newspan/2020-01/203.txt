A Ukrainian Boeing 737-800 carrying at least 170 people crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran because of technical problems, according to the Iranian state news media.
The burial for Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran was delayed after a funeral procession turned to chaos on Tuesday, leaving 56 dead and 213 injured, according to the state broadcaster.
Millions had flooded narrow streets, and, with side streets closed off, they had nowhere to escape, witnesses said.

In Washington: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo maintained there was an imminent threat to Americans and U.S. interests in the days before the general’s death, but did not provide any evidence of it.
Related: President Trump walked back his threat to target cultural sites in military attacks, after the defense secretary said it would be a war crime.
What’s next: Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said any retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani must be a proportional attack on American interests, according to three Iranians familiar with his instructions. In a departure for Tehran, which has often used proxies in its attacks, the ayatollah also said a response should be carried out openly by Iranian forces.
“The Daily”: Our latest episode is about what General Suleimani meant to Iranians.
Hundreds of millions of animals on the continent, including many that are found nowhere else, may have perished over the months of devastating fires, according to some estimates.
Even the animals that have survived, scampering away or hunkering down, may yet die from dehydration or starvation.
Residents are banding together to help feed, find and rehabilitate survivors, with some even keeping the animals in their homes.

The Japanese authorities turned their attention to Carole Ghosn, the wife of Carlos Ghosn, the fallen auto magnate who skipped bail while awaiting trial in Japan.
Prosecutors said they obtained the warrant on suspicion of giving false testimony. But Mrs. Ghosn, a Lebanese citizen, is believed to be with her husband in Beirut, and Lebanon does not extradite its citizens.
The Japanese ambassador met with Lebanon’s president on Tuesday, but there was no sign they had resolved the issue. Mrs. Ghosn is also a citizen of the U.S., which has an extradition treaty with Japan, but both countries have broad discretion over how they act on such warrants.
Details: Prosecutors said Mrs. Ghosn testified in April that she did not know a person involved in her husband’s case, even though she was in fact in communication with the person, who at the time was wiring money between companies at Mr. Ghosn’s request.
The latest: Japanese airports stepped up security in the wake of Mr. Ghosn’s daring escape, and the authorities said they confiscated the 1.5 billion yen, or nearly $14 million, in bail that Mr. Ghosn forfeited when he fled the country.

Some 3,500 soldiers in the U.S. Army’s 82nd Airborne Division were ordered onto planes at Fort Bragg a few days ago for a rapid deployment to the Middle East amid peaking tensions with Iran. Dave Philipps, who covers veterans and the military for The Times, gave us this about the history of the base.
Fort Bragg is one of the largest U.S. bases. It covers parts of four North Carolina counties and is home to about 50,000 active-duty soldiers — one-tenth of the force. Some call it “the nation’s 911” because some of its troops can deploy in as little as 18 hours.
It has another distinction. Along with nine other installations in the southeastern U.S., Fort Bragg is named for a Confederate official in the Civil War. Maj. Gen. Braxton Bragg commanded the Army of Mississippi until he was removed after being routed by Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.
Many of these bases were created in the first part of the 20th century, when world wars pushed the Army to expand. It looked the other way when local officials named them after men who took up arms against the country.
Though monuments to the Confederacy have been toppled all over the South in recent years, the Army has made no moves to change base names, despite congressional efforts to force it.
