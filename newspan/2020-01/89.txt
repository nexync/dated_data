The voice actor is stepping away from a character who has been criticized as a racial stereotype, but it is unclear whether the convenience-store owner is being erased from the cartoon.
Hank Azaria said he will no longer provide the voice on “The Simpsons” for the convenience-store owner Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, whose thick accent and penny-squeezing ways have led to criticism that the character was a racist stereotype.
It was not clear what Mr. Azaria’s decision, first reported on Friday by the website Slashfilm, meant for Apu, which Mr. Azaria had voiced since the character was created in 1990. The producers of “The Simpsons” and Fox, its network, would not comment on whether Apu would get a new voice or perhaps be retired from the show.
In 2017, the comedian Hari Kondabolu’s documentary “The Problem With Apu” forced Mr. Azaria, who is white, to reckon with his portrayal of the Kwik-E-Mart owner who speaks with a pronounced Indian accent. The film attempted to trace the origin story of Apu and put the character in a broader context of Hollywood depictions of Indians.
In the documentary, Mr. Kondabolu, who is of South Asian descent, called Apu “a white guy doing an impression of a white guy making fun of my father.” Others featured in the film recounted how the character Apu provided bullies with fodder when they were young.
Mr. Kondabolu and Mr. Azaria weren’t able to agree on a way for the voice actor to participate in an interview for the documentary, but Mr. Azaria was faced with even more questions after its debut.
Mr. Kondabolu, a lifelong lover of “The Simpsons,” said in a series of tweets on Friday that his documentary was not intended to result in the removal of Apu as a character but to start a discussion about race and representation. He said that he hopes the show keeps Apu in the fictional town of Springfield.
