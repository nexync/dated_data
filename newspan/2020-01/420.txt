“The earthquakes were strong, and it felt like there was a monster coming out” as in the movies, said Cookie Siscar, who had left the area and was relaying a report from her husband, Emer, a poultry farmer, who was in their home in Batangas, which overlooks the volcano island.
The institute warned that the eruption could cause a “volcanic tsunami” and advised nearby communities to take precautions against possible surges from the lake that surrounds the volcano. About 6,000 people live on the island, and boats took residents to safety in Batangas early on Sunday.
Tens of thousands of people were ordered evacuated from the surrounding area, The Associated Press reported, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage. Manila’s international airport also said on Twitter that flights to and from it were suspended because of the eruption. Volcanic ash was seen “in the vicinity of the airport” and nearby air routes, the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines said.
The volcano island has been showing signs of activity since last March, and about three dozen eruptions have been recorded in recent history. Sitting on a lake that partly fills a caldera formed thousands of years ago, it is a popular attraction for tourists, who view it from a ridge in Cavite Province to the north.
“It is very scary,” she said, describing “ominous clouds above us” and thunder and lightning.
Last January, an eruption at the most active volcano in the island nation — the Mayon, in Albay Province, about 200 miles east of the Taal — prompted an alert level of four as it generated up to 1,600 feet of lava fountains and ash fell on two nearby villages.
