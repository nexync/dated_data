LAST STORIES, by William Trevor. (Penguin, 213 pp., $17.) These 10 tales from the Irish virtuoso of the short story, who died in 2016, center on ordinary people whose lives veer in surprising directions. “In this small, final, seemingly quiet but ultimately volcanic book of stories, Trevor denies and defies — maybe spites — the promise of decline,” Cynthia Ozick wrote here.
UNQUIET, by Linn Ullmann. Translated by Thilo Reinhard. (Norton, 392 pp., $15.95.) In this sixth novel by Ullmann, whose parents are the actress Liv Ullmann and the director Ingmar Bergman, the author wrestles with family history by interviewing her father. The characters “seem stranger, sadder and more real than the actress and the filmmaker we might have thought we knew,” A.O. Scott wrote here.
