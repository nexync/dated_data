Cora, who spent two seasons as the Boston manager, was Houston’s bench coach in 2017 and has been implicated in an M.L.B. report on the Astros’ cheating.
The reverberations of the Houston Astros’ sign-stealing scandal reached Boston on Tuesday night when Alex Cora — the former Houston bench coach who was implicated as a mastermind of the scheme in an M.L.B. report on the matter — lost his job as manager of the Red Sox.
M.L.B. investigators identified Cora as a central figure in an illicit scheme to steal opposing catchers’ signs via a video feed and communicate them to the Astros’ hitters, according to a report issued Monday by Commissioner Rob Manfred.
Cora’s departure — which came a day after the announcement of yearlong suspensions for Astros Manager A.J. Hinch and General Manager Jeff Luhnow, who were subsequently fired — further clouded the future of the Mets’ new manager, Carlos Beltran. An outfielder with Houston in 2017, Beltran was the only the Astros player implicated in the report.
A Mets spokesman said on Tuesday night that the team had no comment, leaving Beltran in a precarious sort of status quo. The Red Sox said they would hold a news conference on Wednesday at Fenway Park to expand on their Tuesday statement.
While the Red Sox owners seemed eager to fire General Manager Dave Dombrowski last September as the team slumped to an 84-78 record, they had no desire to lose Cora — until the Astros’ saga unfolded.
The Red Sox — whose use of an Apple Watch in the dugout in 2017 prompted Manfred to issue a leaguewide warning against electronic sign-stealing — may soon face other consequences from M.L.B. for their 2018 behavior. Besides suspending Luhnow and Hinch, M.L.B. stripped the Astros of their first- and second-round draft picks for the next two years and fined the team $5 million.
