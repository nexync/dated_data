Whites made with the chasselas grape are turning up in wine shops around New York.
Swiss winemakers are eyeing the New York market. Several from the Canton of Vaud in western Switzerland, encompassing the city of Lausanne, are seeing to it that wine shops and restaurants are selling their wines. Among the notable bottles to look for are whites made with chasselas grapes, sometimes called fendant. The grape is native to that region, and one of the rare winemaking varietals that is also used as a table grape. About a quarter of all Swiss wines are chasselas. The wines tend to be somewhat floral, crisp on the palate with good acidity and some rounded elegance. Domaine La Colombe, a biodynamic wine made from old vines grown on several plots, is one thatâ€™s readily available now.
Domaine La Colombe, $24.95 for 750 milliliters, Sherry-Lehmann, 505 Park Avenue (59th Street), |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , sherry-lehmann.com.
