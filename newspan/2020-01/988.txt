The Democrats’ only hope.
There are two competing explanations for Mitch McConnell’s abrupt change in the length of the impeachment trial (to three days, from two).
One is that Republican senators facing tough elections this year didn’t like the perception that they were supporting a sham trial and forced McConnell to make the change. “The fact that McConnell had to make significant changes to rules just before the vote suggests he has less control over the trial than widely believed,” Judd Legum, author of the Popular Information newsletter, wrote.
Either way, the message is the same. Senate Republicans aren’t going to hold President Trump accountable for repeatedly violating his oath of office, but they are worried about a perception among swing voters that they are pushovers.
That worry points toward the best strategy for Democrats to follow: Hammer home a few simple story lines about Trump and his enablers. He is using the powers of his office to benefit himself and is damaging the national interest, and Republican senators are covering up for him.
That’s the Democrats’ only hope at this stage. Take their case to the American people, and make Republicans uncomfortable.
And so the president’s defense, the argument and the team alike, has another purpose: It’s a message to Republican senators. It says to each of them that no, the White House will not make a factual argument on the merits of the case—not a real one, anyway. And no, it will not make a real legal argument either. It, rather, will announce that, per George Orwell, two plus two equals five. And it will demand of the senators that they get in line to endorse that proposition, preferably on television, where the president can see. It will be a failure of loyalty if they are not willing to do this. And they will be subject to retaliation. It’s not a strategy that would work in court. But the Senate is not, at the end of the day, a court.
