An author and a wannabe meet on a private island in a film based on a tale by Hakan Nesser.
In 1945 the literary critic Edmund Wilson, riffing on an Agatha Christie title, asked “Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?” His attack on what he called “detective stories” did nothing to deter the popularity of mysteries in print or onscreen. But his title point is salient. Unless a detective puzzle is so diabolically constructed that it sustains fascination in the absence of credible human interest (as in Ellery Queen), some emotional investment is desirable.
“Intrigo: Death of an Author,” the first of three movies directed by Daniel Alfredson based on mysterious tales by the Swedish author Hakan Nesser, has an intricate plot that reaches for numerous emotional resonances. It starts off small: A middle-aged translator and would-be writer (Benno Fürmann) visits a much older, revered author (Ben Kingsley) on a private island. There the younger man reads a tale, soon to be revealed as autobiographical, which is reenacted onscreen.
In that story, a man contrives the “accidental” death of his adulterous wife. His feelings of guilt are complicated when, years later, he recognizes her cough on a radio recording of a classical concert. This leads him to the town of Maardam — the fictional setting of all the stories in Nesser’s trilogy — where he also undertakes a translation of a final opus by a writer who’s committed suicide.
The movie’s structural dynamics make it play like a cross between “Nocturnal Animals” and “Sleuth.” But the stagings are stilted; the relations between the conflicted characters never catch fire. Despite its varied European settings, the movie is largely in English. While translation is a prominent feature in the story, it’s never really established what language is native to the central characters. In any event, when the pieces fall into place, the question of who cares lingers.
Rated R for language and themes. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes.
