One of Trump’s top foes read aloud the articles of impeachment against him on the floor of the Senate.
Chief Justice John Roberts and senators took oaths to be impartial during the impeachment trial.
Trump said he wants a short trial.
The day began with a federal office declaring that the president broke the law in withholding aid from Ukraine.
The Senate trial will get underway in earnest after a four-day weekend.
With the six other House Democrats serving as impeachment managers beside him, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, ceremoniously walked the articles of impeachment from the House chamber to the Senate chamber midday Thursday. It was the second such journey for the group in the past 24 hours, after formally delivering the articles to the Senate on Wednesday evening.
With the full Senate seated before him, Mr. Schiff read aloud the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against Mr. Trump. The two charges together are just over eight pages long.

“President Trump thus warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States,” Mr. Schiff said as he concluded.
The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, hit back on Twitter and accused Democrats of the same crimes covered by the articles.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was sworn in Thursday afternoon to preside over the president’s trial where he will perform a largely ceremonial role. (Under Senate rules, the chief justice’s decisions in the trial can be overruled by a majority vote of the senators).
Chief Justice Roberts’s exact duties have yet to be defined, but as the deep partisanship between the Democrats and Republicans spills out over a trial that is expected to last weeks, his reputation for being independent is at stake.
After Chief Justice Roberts took his oath, read to him by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, he turned to the senators in the chamber and asked them to do the same. Then, the senators signed their name in an oath book.
Aides said Mr. Trump was not watching the ceremonial events on television as the trial got underway. But after an event in the Oval Office celebrating National Religious Freedom Day, the president told reporters that he hoped the trial would not last long.
Mr. Trump has vacillated between favoring a short trial or a longer spectacle that could be used as an opportunity to present his side of the story.
White House officials and senior senators have predicted the trial will last two to six weeks. The impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton was five weeks long.
An independent federal watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, found that the Trump administration broke the law when it withheld millions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine. The report, released Thursday, cited a violation of a 1974 law that protects the spending decisions of Congress. The White House budget office rejected the finding.
The White House and Trump allies continued to undercut a flood of new details coming from a Soviet-born businessman involved in the president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to help him politically. The businessman, Lev Parnas, is an associate of the president’s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Mr. Parnas is under federal indictment but out on bail. In a series of interviews with reporters Wednesday, he alleged that his efforts along with Mr. Giuliani to oust the American ambassador to Ukraine were done with the president’s knowledge and consent. Mr. Parnas said Attorney General William P. Barr was also involved in these efforts.
Earlier this week, House Democrats disclosed documents from Mr. Parnas revealing efforts by him and another man to follow the American ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie L. Yovanovitch. On Thursday, the Ukrainian police announced an investigation into whether she was under illegal surveillance while she was stationed there.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, announced a series of deadlines to be met by the impeachment managers and the president’s legal team before the trial begins on Tuesday at 1 p.m. Mr. Trump has until 6 p.m. on Saturday to submit his formal responses to the charges against him.
The trial will be held each day of the week, except Sunday, starting at 1 p.m. During the trial, senators will not be allowed to have their cellphones or other electronic devices in the chamber and their movements outside the chamber will be constricted.
Out of public view, Mr. McConnell and his aides were working to complete a resolution that would set the parameters for the first phase of the trial and be put up for a vote on Tuesday. Democrats could oppose it en masse because it does not guarantee that witnesses can be called and new evidence admitted.
