Justin Bieber’s long-awaited R&B track is an unseasoned song called “Yummy.”Credit...
Considering he’s been one of the biggest pop stars of the 21st century since he was 15 years old, Justin Bieber has always been conspicuously uninterested in pop music. Its artificiality doesn’t suit him. Its polish is antithetical to his just-woke-up charms. And the neutrality of voice it favors — well, Bieber has different tastes. His voice is gentle and a little creamy, and he’s a clear child of 1990s R&B, so much so that at least one critic was inspired to start a campaign to #LetJustinSingRnB.
