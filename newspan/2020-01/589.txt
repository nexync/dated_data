Sunday Review|Did I Just Get Yanged?
Andrew Yang is showing what healthy populism looks like.
It was New Year’s Eve, and I had decided to spend it with Andrew Yang. A self-described “Asian man who’s good at math,” Mr. Yang had raised an impressive $16.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 for his presidential campaign. Despite being newly flush, the campaign didn’t hold its shindig in a Napa Valley wine cave or at Gramercy Tavern, but in a fluorescent-lit room above a bar in Nashua, N.H.
I went to New Hampshire because I wanted to understand how a political rookie with what seemed like little going for him beyond a signature proposal of free money and relentlessly upbeat online fans had gotten this far. What does the URL candidate’s campaign look like IRL?
That night, the Yang Gang, as the candidate’s fans proudly call themselves, was a happy crowd of gamers, former goth girls, Burning Man enthusiasts, sci-fi geeks, students, coders and stoners. When Mr. Yang dropped a “Lord of the Rings” joke — “It’s like the Eye of Sauron is closing in!” he said of his momentum in the race — they erupted in laughter. Hardcore Yang voters are not cool. And that is exactly their, and his, appeal.
It made so much sense that they moved in with Ms. Peterson’s sister in Vermont, 10 minutes from the New Hampshire border, so they could volunteer full time for the campaign and promote him on their YouTube channel.
I don’t know if a universal basic income is the best solution to the problem of inequality. I’m not particularly passionate about lowering the voting age to 16 or requiring police officers to get purple belts in jujitsu. I worry about whether someone with zero foreign policy experience can be the commander in chief.
But as Bernie Sanders sells class rage, Joe Biden promises normalcy and Elizabeth Warren pushes a social progressivism so perfectly doctrinaire it seems tailored for five kids at Oberlin, Andrew Yang’s cheerful iconoclasm is refreshing.
