Mr. Hopkins, 70, of Flora Vista, N.M., had previously been convicted in at least three states of multiple crimes, including illegal weapon possession and impersonating a peace officer in 2006, according to the plea agreement.
Kelly O’Connell, Mr. Hopkins’s lawyer, said Friday that he and his client, who has been in custody since his arrest last April, wanted a plea deal because of health concerns.
At the time of Mr. Hopkins’s arrest, there was speculation that it could lead to a deep investigation of his activities and those of the militia, known as the United Constitutional Patriots. The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico declined to comment on Friday about whether it was looking to the organization or if the group was still even active in the region.
Mr. O’Connell said the group probably no longer existed and his client was not really in touch with it, but he said he could not confirm if Mr. Hopkins was still considered the leader.
Mr. Hopkins was arrested last year as the United Constitutional Patriots faced criticism for its tactics and tensions were rising over ultraconservative paramilitary groups operating along the southwestern border.
In videos uploaded online, armed members of Mr. Hopkins’s organization are seen detaining children and their parents in the desert before handing the migrants over to the United States Border Patrol.
The group’s last post on its own Facebook page asking for money or supplies was made last July.
