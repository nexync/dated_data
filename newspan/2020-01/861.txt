The announcement, which was first reported by The Casper Star Tribune, ended speculation that Ms. Cheney — the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney — would give up her place in House leadership to join a competitive primary for the Senate seat. She had run for the seat in 2014 but withdrew from the race.
Ms. Cheney eventually withdrew from the race. But two years later, in 2016, she ran for and won Representative Cynthia Lummis’s seat following her retirement from the House. Ms. Lummis is one of several Republican candidates for Mr. Enzi’s seat.
