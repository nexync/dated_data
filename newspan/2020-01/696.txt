Martin and Joelle Kilcourse loved living in the colonial they bought in 2010, in the Paradise Green section of Stratford, the most southeastern town in Fairfield County, Conn. But the house was small, and as they considered starting a family they kept their eyes open, checking out listings in and around the area.
That is, until last spring, when the Kilcourses came across a three-bedroom, 2,446-square-foot ranch on a cul-de-sac a block from the Long Island Sound. The house, in the Lordship neighborhood of Stratford, was built in 1957, a fixer-upper on two-thirds of an acre. The couple closed in June for $550,000, and just before Thanksgiving, after selling the old house and renovating the new one, they moved in, along with their nearly 2-year-old daughter.
Stratford is tall and narrow, crisscrossed by the Merritt Parkway and, farther south, Route 1 and Interstate 95. Its leafy suburban streets are interspersed with pockets of commerce, densest along Route 1, and industry, including the massive Sikorsky aircraft plant to the north and a cluster of warehouses to the south. There, the newest addition is a roughly 200,000-square-foot Amazon distribution center, expected to begin operations this spring.
Laura Hoydick, Stratford’s mayor, said the town is poised for economic growth, primed by its proximity to Steelpointe Harbor, a 2.8-million-square-foot retail, office and residential development on the waterfront in neighboring Bridgeport, with plans to add a casino. In Stratford, the cleanup of two Superfund sites, Raymark Industries and the 124-acre Army Engine Plant, is meant to offer significant redevelopment potential within five years.
Stretching from the panoramic Sound to the 401-acre Roosevelt Forest, Stratford is laid out in neighborhoods, where houses are mostly modest, a mix of styles on small lots. There’s Paradise Green, with its smattering of shops and restaurants; historic Putney; and a walkable town center with a train station. In the Oronoque and Beaver Dam neighborhoods, north of the Merritt, and in Lordship, houses are larger and lots are typically an acre, some on pretty esplanades and, in Lordship, on the water.
Donna Otlowski, Stratford’s assessor, said the town has 12,959 single-family homes and 1,045 multifamily homes, plus 2,709 condominiums in 32 complexes, 548 cooperative apartments in two complexes and 506 rental apartments in eight buildings. Ms. Hoydick said 6.4 percent of Stratford’s housing stock is designated affordable.
As for property taxes, Ms. Loban said, the annual bill for a $500,000 home in the northern part of town might be $11,000 to $14,000, compared with $30,000-plus for a waterfront home.
Based on information compiled by SmartMLS, as of Jan. 10 there were 140 single-family homes on the market, from a 1,209-square-foot, three-bedroom duplex, built in 1983 on 0.08 acres and listed at $94,900, to a 4,420-square-foot, four-bedroom waterfront colonial, built in 1880 on 0.32 acres and listed for $1.295 million. There were eight multifamily homes for sale, from a 2,165-square-foot, four-bedroom for $204,361 to a 5,300-square-foot, nine-bedroom for $750,000. And there were 54 condominiums, from a small one-bedroom (less than 400 square feet) for $14,500 to a three-bedroom for $470,000. As for rentals, 35 properties were listed, from $1,000 to $3,500 a month.
The median sales price for a single-family home during the 12-month period ending Jan. 10 was $250,000, unchanged from the previous 12 months. The median price for a multifamily house was $285,000, up from $276,975 in 2018; for condominiums, the median price was $189,000 in 2019, up from $181,250 in 2018. For monthly rentals, the median was $1,488 in 2019, down from $1,625 in 2018.
Ms. Reynolds, a lifelong resident, called Stratford “welcoming and down to earth.” Ms. Hoydick described the community as “hard-working,” a mix of young families drawn by property values and an easy commute, and empty-nesters, some living in Oronoque Village, a 300-acre, 55-and-older townhome complex.
Stratford’s motto is “Offering more from forest to shore,” and indeed there are several Sound shores, among them Short Beach, with sports fields and courts and a nine-hole golf course, and Roosevelt Forest, the only town-owned forest in Connecticut. In between, there are salt marshes, wetlands and parks, like the 30-acre Boothe Memorial Park, where an eclectic collection of structures includes a windmill and a defunct tollbooth.
Residents meet up at town-sponsored events like the Great Pumpkin Festival, a summer concert series in Paradise Green and Blues on the Beach, at Short Beach. Activities for all ages are held at the public library and the Sterling House Community Center. Shopping is plentiful, and culinary options include Jamaican, Latin fusion and Mexican, as well as seaside restaurants and four breweries.
Stratford students are served by the Stratford Public Schools district, whose roughly 7,500 students attend one of nine elementary schools for kindergarten through sixth grade. They move on to one of two middle schools, Harry B. Flood and David Wooster, for seventh and eighth grades, and then go to Frank Scott Bunnell High School or Stratford High School. In 2018, the Stratford Board of Education approved a motion to realign the district, making all schools neighborhood-based.
Wooster was named 2019-20 Middle School of the Year by the Connecticut Association of Schools. Stratford High is undergoing a nearly $126 million expansion, scheduled for completion this fall. The district has an alternative high school program, ALPHA, and tuition-based preschool programs at two elementary schools.
Janet M. Robinson, the superintendent, said that on the 2018-19 Smarter Balanced assessments, 46 percent of the district’s fourth-graders tested proficient in English language arts and 44 percent tested proficient in math, compared with 55 percent and 53 percent statewide. Mean SAT scores for the district’s 2019 graduating class were 484 in evidence-based reading and writing and 463 in math, compared with 514 and 500 statewide.
Commuters to Manhattan, about 65 miles southwest, can catch Metro-North Railroad’s New Haven Line at the Stratford station. Peak trains to and from Grand Central Terminal take 83 to 113 minutes; round-trip fares are $42 peak, $31.50 off-peak and $449 monthly.
There is currently a waiting list for commuter parking permits; daily parking is available for $5. Residents who prefer to drive or who work nearby have quick access to the Merritt Parkway and Interstate 95, but may face rush-hour congestion.
Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Stratford played host to luminaries like Katharine Hepburn, James Earl Jones and others who came to perform at the American Shakespeare Theater. The 1,500-seat theater was built in 1955 overlooking the Housatonic, modeled after the Globe Theater in London and made with teak that grayed with age.
The theater was active for several decades; its last full season was in 1982, its final performance in 1989. After that, the building lay dormant until, last January, it burned to the ground. Three local teens were charged with arson.
