A reader who chronicled the basketball star’s early career says “he also lit up a room.” Also: The departure of New York’s subways chief.
For two years in the ’90s, I chronicled Kobe Bryant’s feats on the basketball court as a young journalist with the local paper, The Main Line Times. He wasn’t just the greatest basketball player I ever laid eyes on; he also lit up a room. That warm megawatt smile, that sparkle in his eye.
He had the grace of a ballet dancer, the swagger of Michael Jordan and the deft hand of Picasso, flicking passes here and there to cutters and runners and fast-breakers. You watched him play and you felt alive.
I haven’t seen or spoken to Kobe in over 20 years. I watched him from afar, from New York, and even now I cannot comprehend just how great he was: the 81-point game, the five championships, those jaw-dropping dunks. Reading about it all now, I am awe-struck.
But that’s not going to happen now. They say there’s no crying in baseball, but there is crying in basketball. And today, we all cry.
First off, thank you, Andy Byford. After several miserable years of unreliable subway service, my commute has recently become more bearable.
Second, I’m shocked by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s willingness to let Mr. Byford leave. How can one person’s ego be allowed to get in the way of something so essential to the quality of life of millions of New Yorkers who use the subways daily?
I am going to miss Mr. Byford and his leadership. I pray that the governor doesn’t do anything else to slow down progress.
