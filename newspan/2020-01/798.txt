Johnson battled racism early on and introduced Dwayne Johnson to professional wrestling years before he became a famous actor.
Born in a small town in Nova Scotia, Johnson rose to fame in the 1980s as a muscular wrestler who bounded off the ropes, delivered punishing jabs and called himself “the king of the drop-kick” for his ability to dispatch opponents with that singular move.
His opponents included well-known figures in professional wrestling, like Greg (the Hammer) Valentine, Don Muraco and Adrian Adonis. But he was perhaps best known for pairing with another black wrestler, Tony Atlas, in a tag team known as the Soul Patrol.
The two became the first black world tag team champions in W.W.E. history when they defeated the Wild Samoans on Dec. 10, 1983, according to World Wrestling Entertainment, which released a video clip of some of Johnson’s highlights on Wednesday.
He said he had refused to take part in some degrading performances.
When his son showed an interest in wrestling, Johnson said, he offered to train him.
He was born Wayde Douglas Bowles on Aug. 24, 1944, and grew up in Amherst, Nova Scotia, before moving to Toronto as a teenager. He boxed as a young man and recalled sparring with George Foreman and Muhammad Ali.
Johnson’s sports-entertainment career began in the mid-1960s with the National Wrestling Alliance. But he found his greatest success with what is now the W.W.E., joining it in 1983, the organization said.
Johnson retired from the ring in 1991. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available.
The younger Johnson eventually became the more famous member of the family, as the star of action and comedy movies.
Dwayne Johnson made his debut as a W.W.E. wrestler in 1996, and his father became a frequent part of his act, leaping into the ring and defending his son when he looked to be in trouble.
In 2008, the younger Johnson helped induct his father into the W.W.E. Hall of Fame.
