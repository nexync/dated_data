Awkwafina’s award for her role in “The Farewell” was the film’s only win of the night.
Her award was the only win of the night for the movie, in which Awkwafina plays a Chinese-American immigrant struggling with her cultural identity while trying to shield her grandmother (Zhao Shuzhen) from a grim diagnosis.
It was a dry year at the Globes for films directed by or about women, with “The Farewell” director Lulu Wang — and all other women — being left out of the directing category.
Here is Awkwafina’s speech in its entirety.
This is great. Thank you. If anything, if I fall upon hard times, we can sell this, so that’s good. First of all, thank you so much to the Hollywood Foreign Press. I’ve never been to the Golden Globes, so I’m here now, and it’s this and it’s great. I’d like to thank everyone at A24, Peter Saraf, Dani Melia, Big Beach and Andrew Miano.
I’d like to thank the woman who plays my grandma in “The Farewell,” Zhao Shuzhen. … Thank you, and most importantly, to Lulu Wang, our incredible director. You gave me this chance, the chance of a lifetime, and you taught me so much. And just filming this story, being with you, was incredible. I’d like to dedicate this to my dad, Wally.  And to my grandma, my best friend, the woman who raised me. And to my mother, Tia, who I always hoped was watching from somewhere above, and I hope that she’s watching now. Thank you all, thank you.
