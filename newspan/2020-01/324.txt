A Sundance favorite comes to Hulu. And a new documentary is on PBS.
LA STRADA (1956) Stream on Criterion. Directed by the legendary Federico Fellini, “La Strada” has been a highly regarded emblem of Italian cinema for over 60 years. It stars Giulietta Masina (Fellini’s wife) as Gelsomina, a simple woman who was sold by her mother into the servitude of Zampanò, a circus strongman played by Anthony Quinn. The pair travel from town to town, with Gelsomina providing an opening act to the strongman’s, until they encounter a tightrope artist who baits the strongman into violence. A comment on the innately human desire for companionship, the story is a “picaresque parable,” A.H. Weiler wrote for The Times in 1956, the year the film won an Academy Award for best foreign language film.
