The music itself was colorfully orchestrated, restless and likable â€” if a little generic and, for all its tumultuousness, thin. The first movement is run through with an assertive four-note theme, like a somber fanfare. I heard echoes of Prokofiev and Messiaen in the piano part, full of pounding rhythms, cascading chords, spiraling swirls of fast notes, and that four-note theme, played in every contortion. The mercurial, mysterious slow movement was the strongest music, with intriguing cluster chords in the piano and shimmering, eerie orchestra sonorities. The finale is a dizzying perpetual-motion toccata. Mr. Tiempo gave a scintillating and virtuosic performance.
This program continues through Tuesday, and Mr. Dudamel conducts the orchestra through Jan. 25, at David Geffen Hall, Lincoln Center; |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , nyphil.org.
