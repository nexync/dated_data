Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House, said Thursday that she would not seek the Senate seat being vacated by Michael B. Enzi, choosing instead to focus on her re-election campaign.
The announcement, which was first reported by The Casper Star Tribune, ended speculation that Ms. Cheney — the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney — would give up her place in House leadership to join a competitive primary for the Senate seat. She had run for the seat in 2014 but withdrew from the race.
A lawyer and former State Department official who was also a pundit for Fox News, Ms. Cheney, 53, ran to oust Mr. Enzi in 2014 after moving from suburban Washington to Wyoming, where she had not lived for decades. Ms. Cheney was accused of being a carpetbagger, and her campaign against Mr. Enzi, a popular incumbent, divided Republicans in the state.
Her candidacy also caused a rift within her family; she spoke out against same-sex marriage during her campaign, angering her sister, Mary Cheney, and her wife, Heather Poe.
Ms. Cheney eventually withdrew from the race. But two years later, in 2016, she ran for and won Representative Cynthia Lummis’s seat following her retirement from the House. Ms. Lummis is one of several Republican candidates for Mr. Enzi’s seat.
