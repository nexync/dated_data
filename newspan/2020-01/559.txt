Thomas Valva died on Jan. 17 after being left in an unheated garage overnight, the police said.
“We have determined Thomas was never in the driveway that morning, and he suffered head and facial injuries that were not consistent with the father’s account,” the commissioner added.

That, prosecutors said, was when Ms. Pollina asked him to remove his hand.
