A new film about a schoolgirl’s erotic obsession examines the social hierarchies of midcentury Haiti and present-day France.
If “Nocturama” was a glossy execution of a superficial conceit, “Zombi Child,” the director’s new film, is a scintillating act of discretion — or, if you are disinclined to trust Bonello, of evasion. The connection between ritual and revenge in Haitian custom and race and class hierarchies in contemporary France gets a deliberate teasing out here.
The movie opens in Haiti in 1962. In a dark room, a man chops up a dead blowfish. He pulverizes the parts into powder, which he sprinkles on the insoles of a pair of shoes. Those shoes incapacitate another man wearing them; he dies, is buried and is revived as a zombie, enslaved, to cut cane in a field with other such afflicted people.
Bonello, never much interested in narrative momentum, keeps the idea of story at a steady distance for the first hour. Then he reveals Fanny’s love object and has Fanny approach Mélissa’s aunt Mambo Katy (Katiana Milfort), who, we discover, is the daughter of the zombie we meet at the opening. The younger woman believes Katy to be a voodoo priestess, and asks her for magic relief from erotic obsession.
The movie revisits Haiti throughout, time-tripping all the way, as its modern tale puts a genre spin on the theme of cultural appropriation. The movie’s inconclusiveness is the source of its appeal; “Zombi Child” is fueled by insinuation and fascination.
