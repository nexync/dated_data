Join us as the Times reporters James Gorman and Nicholas St. Fleur explain how they research and write about scientific questions in the world around us — and how citizen science often plays a role.
In this 55-minute webinar, recorded live in Oct. 2017, we show you how to use Times reporting and multimedia in STEM classrooms.
From following the path of the eclipse to debating medical ethics to demonstrating physics principles with the movement of ants, the Times reporters James Gorman and Nicholas St. Fleur explain how they research and write about scientific questions in the world around us — and how citizen science often plays a role.
The Learning Network editors along with Sara Rust, a high school teacher, then show you features from Times science and health reporting — including reporting from Trilobites and Well, videos from ScienceTake, infographics from The Upshot, and virtual reality experiences from our climate team — that can be easily woven into your curriculum.
Finally, we invite you to submit your own lesson plans to our popular Reader Ideas column.
