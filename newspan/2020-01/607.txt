Opinion|Why Did One-Quarter of the World’s Pigs Die in a Year?
Swine fever devastated China’s stock because with unsound governance, even sound regulations have perverse effects.
Mr. Huang is a global-health expert specializing in China.
Under such circumstances — problem No. 3 — even the rules and regulations designed to ensure safety only fueled the spread of swine fever. For example, the requirement that slaughtering occur only at appointed abattoirs, a measure that was supposed to prevent sick pigs from being slaughtered illicitly (and, possibly, unsafely), turned those slaughterhouses into transmission hubs: Contaminated hogs came into contact with more animals and more people as they were brought to the facilities.
