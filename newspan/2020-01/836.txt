Mr. Sanders edged out his competitors in The Des Moines Register/CNN poll released on Friday, the first significant survey from Iowa in nearly two months.
The deadline to qualify for Tuesday’s Democratic debate was 11:59 p.m. on Friday, and normally, an Iowa poll released hours before such a deadline could bolster candidates on the cusp of qualifying. But this time, no one was on the cusp.
Mr. Booker and Mr. Yang both met the Democratic National Committee’s donor requirement, but Mr. Yang had only one qualifying poll of the required four, and Mr. Booker had none. The Iowa poll gave Mr. Yang his second qualifying mark, but it was not enough to get him into the debate.
