WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether the federal government was entitled to break a promise to shield insurance companies from some of the risks they took in participating in the exchanges established by President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act.
The health care law established so-called risk corridors meant to help insurance companies cope with the risks they took when they decided to participate in the law’s marketplaces without knowing who would sign up for coverage. Under the program, the federal government would limit insurance companies’ gains and losses on insurance sold in the marketplaces from 2014 through 2016.
But Congress later enacted a series of appropriation riders that seemed to bar the promised payments. The insurance companies sued, but a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled against them.
In urging the Supreme Court to hear the case, two insurance companies said the appeals court’s decision threatened to encourage the government to walk away from other inconvenient promises.
The court agreed to hear three cases on the issue: Maine Community Health Options v. United States, No. 18-1023; Moda Health Plan Inc. v. United States, No. 18-1028; and Land of Lincoln Mutual Health Insurance Co. v. United States, No. 18-1038. The three cases will be consolidated for a single hour of arguments and heard in the court’s next term, which will begin in October.
