The Greens Are Germany’s Leading Political Party. Wait, What?
As the country took climate change to heart, it was only a matter of time before its politics did too.
Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.
And Ms. Merkel had a quality that is hard for a young party to copy in the digital age: She never said a wrong word. Her mantra was better not to communicate than to communicate falsely. This calculated silence left room for very favorable interpretations of her policies.
During her recent address at Harvard, for instance, Ms. Merkel was praised for introducing same-sex marriage in Germany. The truth is that she opposed it and Parliament overruled her — but she also never voiced that opposition too strongly, so she can now claim some of the credit, after the fact. Also, while Ms. Merkel wins praise for her opposition to restrictions on migration, she quietly arranged it so that Turkey and other countries get paid to act as Europe’s doorman, keeping refugees away from the continent’s shores. And for all the hype about Ms. Merkel as a climate chancellor, Germany will miss its 2020 climate goals.
Ms. Merkel nonetheless offered the voters a good national conscience. The Greens could try to do the same. But it’s one thing for a nonaligned pragmatist like her to don that environmental mantle; it’s another for a party to come in promising to make climate change the core of its agenda.
Today, many Germans may like to think of themselves as trendy and green. But turning attitude into policies might prove harder for the Green party than it has been for the green chancellor.
