The show, a mix of mind reading and magic, is to open in September.
Derren Brown is bringing his bag of tricks to Broadway.
The renowned British mentalist, who for years has been mystifying audiences in person and on television with what appears to be an ability to read minds, will play a four-month run at the Cort Theater, starting in September.
He arrives at a time when mind magic seems to be enjoying a bit of a renaissance — not only did Mr. Brown have an Off Broadway run, at the Atlantic Theater Company in 2017, but so did Derek DelGaudio, and the group of magicians called the Illusionists have for four years been performing over the holidays on Broadway.
Mr. Brown, who has called himself a “psychological illusionist,” said his skill base “is somewhere between mind reading and suggestion and influence,” and his act “is not quite a magic show, but it’s not a play — it’s a bit of a niche that’s just me doing my thing.” He found a wide audience in Britain in 2000 with the television show “Derren Brown: Mind Control.” He has since performed steadily on tour and on television, and has written several books.
His Broadway show, called “Derren Brown: Secret,” is the same show that ran at the Atlantic; it is directed by Andrew O’Connor and Andy Nyman, and written by them along with Mr. Brown.
