Older women with more fat around the middle had a higher risk for heart disease compared to those with fat around the thighs.
 Apple-shaped women have more fat around the waist, pear-shaped more around the hips and legs.
Writing in the European Heart Journal, researchers studied 2,683 postmenopausal women with normal B.M.I.s, following them for an average of 18 years. They found 291 cases of cardiovascular disease.
After adjusting for other factors, they found that neither fat mass nor body fat percentage was associated with the risk for cardiovascular disease.
But those in the highest one-quarter for percent of fat around the waist had a 91 percent increased risk for coronary heart disease or stroke compared with those in the lowest one-quarter. And those in the highest one-quarter for leg fat mass had a 32 percent reduced risk compared with those in the lowest.
