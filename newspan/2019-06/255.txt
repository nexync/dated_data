From Lyndon Johnson to Richard Nixon, presidents have long had fraught relationships with Fed chairs.
“We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games - as they have for many years!”— Mr. Trump, in a tweet, suggesting the Fed take the same steps as China and Europe.
Mr. Trump views central banks as being in an economic arms race, suggesting that efforts taken by other countries to help their economies are directly counter to the interest of the United States. While he has long accused China of manipulating its currency to gain a leg up in global trade, the president has recently accused Europe of doing it, too. Mr. Trump has asserted that the Fed should just fight fire with fire and manipulate its currency as well.
