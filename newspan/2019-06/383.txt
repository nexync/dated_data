On Sunday night, Ali Stroker became the first person who uses a wheelchair to win a Tony Award.
A ramp had not been built to the stage, but Ms. Stroker was still backstage, in the wings, from the performance when her category was announced.
After her win, Ms. Stroker told reporters that Broadway theaters are generally accessible to audience members with disabilities, but backstage areas are not.
“I would ask theater owners and producers to really look into how they can begin to make the backstage accessible so that performers with disabilities can get around,” she said.
Last month, Ms. Stroker told The Times about her experience in the musical and what it was like to dance in a wheelchair.
At the Tony Awards, Ms. Stroker said she has heard from many young performers who shared that they were motivated by seeing her on Broadway.
