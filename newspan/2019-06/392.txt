The 1974 documentary anticipated David Hockney’s success and the rise of reality TV. A new 4K restoration screens at the Metrograph this week.
First released in 1974, “A Bigger Splash,” Jack Hazan’s semi-fictional portrait of the British artist David Hockney, has proved prescient.
For one thing, the movie — revived for a week in a new, 4K restoration at the Metrograph — is largely concerned with the creation of “Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures),” which sold for $90.3 million at auction last November, shattering the record for the work of a living artist. For another, Hazan’s 106-minute documentary created a template for what, a quarter-century later, would be known as reality television.
The film never shows Hockney in Los Angeles, but follows him to New York, where he has a gallery show, including “Portrait of an Artist.” (An ambivalent review in The New York Times characterized him as “an extremely clever artist, with a facility that both amazes and dismays.”) Compared to the lotus-land settings of many of Hockney’s paintings, the brute symmetry of Midtown Manhattan seems singularly uninviting.
“A Bigger Splash” is both meandering and forthright. Hockney allowed the British-born, American-trained Hazan remarkable access. At one point the camera joins the artist in the shower. The most notorious scene shows Schlesinger in bed with another man. Consequently, the movie received an X rating in Britain and was held up in customs in the United States before it was screened at the 1974 New York Film Festival. Customs officials described it as “disgusting and immoral.” Hockney himself was not initially pleased with it and reportedly considered paying Hazan 20,000 pounds for the negative.
