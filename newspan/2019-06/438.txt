A look at one of the entries that stumped solvers in last week’s puzzles.
Do you know your blood type? There are multiple ways to group blood types in hematology, but the best known is the ABO system.
Quite a few solvers missed the clue “System used in hematology,” for the entry ABO in the Thursday, May 30, crossword by Brandon Koppy. The entry has appeared in The New York Times Crossword a total of 137 times, however, so it’s worth getting to know.
Blood consists of cells and a liquid called plasma. In the ABO system, an individual’s blood type depends on what each part of the blood contains: A antigens (commonly known as Type A), B antigens (Type B), both (Type AB) or neither (Type O). The correct classification is especially important in blood transfusions, as a mismatch could cause an adverse, potentially fatal reaction.
The ABO system was discovered by the Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner in 1901, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1930.
Clues that involve wordplay are in bold.
