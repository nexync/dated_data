Paul J. Manafort, President Trumpâ€™s former campaign chairman who is serving a federal prison sentence, is expected to be transferred within the next few weeks to the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City, where he will most likely be held in isolation while facing state fraud charges, people with knowledge of the matter said.
He once wore ultraluxury clothes, including a $33,000 blue lizard jacket, an $18,000 suede coat and $12,000 suits, but will likely trade in his federal prison garb for a drab khaki shirt and trousers at Rikers.
