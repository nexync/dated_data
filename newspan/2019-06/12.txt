In the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran agreed to curb its uranium enrichment program but retained some of the technology and material to make fuel for a weapon.
Uranium ore contains less than 1 percent of U-235, an isotope used to fuel reactors and make bombs. A process called enrichment increases the percentage of U-235.
Iran was allowed to keep up to 300 kilograms, or 660 pounds, of uranium enriched to 3.7 percent for nuclear power. Iran also agreed to stop enriching uranium beyond 5 percent.
Iran’s threat: Iran announced Monday that it would break the 660-pound cap in 10 days.
Iran had a stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 percent, which could have made it faster to accumulate fuel for a weapon. The country agreed to dilute the stockpile or make it unusable.
Iran’s threat: Iran said it might resume enriching uranium to 20 percent.
Iran would need to continue enriching to 90 percent or higher to make a weapon, something it had never achieved.
Iran did not say whether it planned to enrich uranium beyond 20 percent.
