Four children, ages 2 to 13, visited the fair from June 8 to 15 and exhibited symptoms of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli from June 10 to 16, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency said in a news release on Friday.
The 2-year-old died on June 24 from complications of the bacteria; the other three children who were sickened were not hospitalized. Their conditions were not immediately available on Sunday.
Children more commonly contract E. coli from food — eating undercooked ground beef, for instance — than from animals, Dr. Glatter said. The San Diego health agency said it had reinspected food outlets visited by the children and found no links to the cases.
In general, Dr. Glatter said, young children and older adults have a higher risk of developing an invasive infection. “That said, even teens, children who are healthy and young adults may develop a life-threatening infection resulting in anemia and kidney failure,” he said.
The San Diego County Fair, which opened on May 31, shut public access to the animals because it could not pinpoint where exactly the transmissions had occurred, the fair’s information officer, Annie Pierce, said.
Ms. Pierce says signs and washing stations are posted throughout the animal areas. There are also staff members on the grounds reminding visitors to wash their hands, she said. The fair, she added, conducts a daily on-site inspection of animals looking for any signs of illness.
