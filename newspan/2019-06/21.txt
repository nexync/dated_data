The profane and bloody comic “sequel” to “Titus Andronicus” has been dying at the box office.
Taylor Mac’s first Broadway play, “Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus,” will close on Sunday, seven weeks earlier than scheduled.
The play is an experimental comedy that imagines a conversation between a maid and a clown left to clean up the dead bodies after the bloodshed that roils the ruling class in Shakespeare’s gory tragedy.
An unusual project for Broadway, it marked the arrival of Mr. Mac to the commercial stage. His previous works, in which he often starred, were produced in nonprofit spaces. His best-known project, “A 24-Decade History of Popular Music,” has been presented to acclaim around the world.
“Mess is both the aesthetic and the subject of ‘Gary,’ ” The New York Times theater critic Jesse Green wrote in praising the show. And “Gary” was nominated for seven Tony Awards, including best play.
But it was shut out at the Sunday ceremony, and is the first show to announce a closing afterward.
Directed by George C. Wolfe, “Gary” had a cast of Broadway favorites: the Tony winners Nathan Lane and Julie White, along with multiple nominee Kristine Nielsen.
Yet the show’s box office has been dwindling since opening. Last week it grossed $211,093, which is just 24 percent of its box office potential, and had a very low (for Broadway) average paid admission of $41.64.
The play, one of five to open last season with Scott Rudin as the lead producer, was capitalized for $4.9 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and has not recouped those costs.
Upon closing, it will have played 45 previews and 65 regular performances.
