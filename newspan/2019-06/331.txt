The printed page has seen better days.
To improve their chances in a struggling industry, two of the largest companies in the business of printing and distributing magazines, books and catalogs last year agreed to a merger deal that was expected to close in the next few months.
Not so fast, the Justice Department said.
In its attempt to block the deal, the Justice Department had two allies from the community of writers: The Authors Guild and PEN America. “The lack of competition among book printers has already caused a bottleneck and increased publishing costs, and a merger between these two companies could exacerbate this situation by creating a monopoly,” the Authors Guild said in a statement in March.
Leaders of Quad and LSC Communications said the proposed merger was essential to their companies’ continued survival. The deal “will strengthen the role of print in an increasingly multichannel media world that is dominated by digital advertising,” said Joel Quadracci, the Quad chief executive.
The migration of readers to the internet has led to falling revenues, layoffs and closings at many traditional media companies. Digital advertising has failed to make up for losses in print advertising, with Google and Facebook gobbling up a large share of the revenue generated by online ads.
