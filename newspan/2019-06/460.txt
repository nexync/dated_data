In a response filed on May 7, U.S. Soccer denies many of the specifics provided in the lawsuit, including those mentioned above, but it doesn’t dispute that the men’s and women’s players are not paid equally. Instead, it asserts that those inequities are a result of “different pay structures for performing different work.” It characterizes as “misleading and inaccurate” the claims that the women’s team generates more revenue than the men’s, while also framing the women’s and men’s teams as so different from each other that they can’t legitimately be compared at all. This is true in at least one sense: The women are way, way better. The men’s national team lost in the round of 16 at the 2014 World Cup and didn’t even qualify for the 2018 World Cup. American men haven’t won an Olympic medal in more than a century. Partly as a consequence of their superior results, from 2015 to 2018, the women’s team played 19 more matches than the men. In other words, the women aren’t working as hard as their male counterparts for less money; they’re working harder for less money. For the record, the men’s team’s players association released a statement of full-throated support for their women’s team compatriots and the mutual goal of equal pay.
