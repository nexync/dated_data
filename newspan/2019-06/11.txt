President Trump signed an executive order targeting Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. These financial sanctions affect him and his close associates.
In a few moments, I’ll be signing an executive order imposing hard-hitting sanctions on the supreme leader of Iran and the office of the supreme leader of Iran, and many others. The supreme leader of Iran is one who ultimately is responsible for the hostile conduct of the regime. He’s respected within his country. His office oversees the regime’s most brutal instruments, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Sanctions imposed through the executive order, that I’m about to sign, will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leader’s office, and those closely affiliated with him and the office, access to key financial resources and support. We will continue to increase pressure on Tehran until the regime abandons its dangerous activities and its aspirations, including the pursuit of nuclear weapons, increased enrichment of uranium, development of ballistic missiles, engagement in and support for terrorism, fueling of foreign conflicts and belligerent acts directed against the United States and its allies. O.K., thank you very much, everybody.
