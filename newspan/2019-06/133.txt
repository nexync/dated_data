The Supreme Court refused to hear the appeal of a man who has been held in wartime detention for 17 years with no end in sight.
“It is past time to confront the difficult question left open by” a 2004 ruling allowing the indefinite detention of Guantánamo detainees captured after the 2001 American invasion of Afghanistan, Justice Breyer wrote in a statement about the denial of the request to hear the man’s appeal.
Justice Breyer flagged similar concerns in 2014 when the Supreme Court decided not to hear the appeal of another Guantánamo detainee, but that detainee had not raised the legal arguments. On Monday, none of the other justices joined him in indicating a desire to take on the issues raised by a case he had essentially invited.
Mr. Alwi is one of 40 remaining detainees. Nine are charged or convicted in the troubled military commissions system; 26 are recommended for continued detention; and five are recommended for transfers to stable countries, although the Trump administration has not sought to carry them out.
