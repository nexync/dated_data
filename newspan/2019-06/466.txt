A gynecological oncologist who worked at a University of California, Los Angeles, student health center has been charged with two counts of sexual battery, according to his lawyer.
The doctor, James Heaps, was employed at the clinic from about 1983 to 2010 and was hired by U.C.L.A. Health in 2014, the school said in a statement on Monday. The university said it was made aware of the accusations of sexual misconduct last year and began an investigation. Dr. Heaps has pleaded not guilty to both charges, his lawyer, Tracy Green, said.
The investigation was prompted by sexual misconduct accusations from two patients who received care at a U.C.L.A. Health office in 2017 and 2018, and Ms. Green said the charges are in relation to those accusations. The university also found an anonymous Yelp review from 2015 that said Dr. Heaps had sexually abused the person who posted the comment while the person was a U.C.L.A. student, according to Rhonda Curry, a spokeswoman for the school. A fourth allegation was discovered in February 2019, Ms. Curry said.
The university immediately notified law enforcement and the Medical Board of California, according to Ms. Curry.
Ms. Curry clarified that of the four accusations, only one — the Yelp review — came from a former student.
Ms. Green said Dr. Heaps was not available for comment.
One of the first two misconduct complaints is from a woman who saw Dr. Heaps for an examination in February 2018 for severe pelvic pain and suspicion of ovarian cancer, Ms. Green said.
She said that during the examination of the person who filed the second complaint, another clinic staff member had been present.
In March, U.C.L.A. started an independent review of its response to sexual misconduct in its clinics. U.C.L.A. said it would “identify and implement” the necessary changes based on the findings of the review.
