Katie Sturino and John Forkin were married June 19 at the Cooper Hewitt Museum’s Arthur Ross Terrace and Garden in Manhattan. Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and the father of a friend of the bride, officiated.

She is the founder of Megababe, a line of beauty and personal care products for women. She is a volunteer, focusing on stopping puppy mills, with the Humane Society of the United States She graduated from the University of Wisconsin.
She is a daughter of Nancy Sturino and Santo J. Sturino, of Whitefish Bay, Wis.
The groom, 36, is taking his wife’s name. He is a law student at Hofstra. He graduated from the University at Albany.
He is a son of Eileen Conmie and John Joseph Forkin, of Canton, Ga.
The bride’s first marriage ended in divorce, as did the groom’s.
Ms. Sturino and Mr. Forkin met on the Bumble dating app in February 2017. At the time of their meeting, Mr. Forkin was living in Astoria, Queens, and working as a UPS delivery driver, and Ms. Sturino was living in Manhattan and already an entrepreneur. Their first date, Mr. Forkin’s idea, was a screening of the Disney movie “Beauty and the Beast” in Manhattan, on Valentine’s Day.
Mr. Forkin had decided long before that Ms. Sturino was more than just good company. “Not only was she beautiful, I was really inspired by what she does to advance women and for puppy mill awareness,” he said. Now in his second year of law school, he too hopes to inspire others, by becoming a civil rights or public interest lawyer.
He had no qualms about taking his wife’s last name. “I thought, why not be progressive about it?” he said.
