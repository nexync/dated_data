Vintage photos of joy, adventure and homesickness at summer camp.
That’s per Helene Drobenare, the executive director of Camp Young Judaea Sprout Lake, in Dutchess County, New York.
We have been dropping off our children at camp since the 19th century — when Americans started worrying about pampering, cosseting and “indoor-ness” — so you would think by now we would have gotten good at it. And yet, Ms. Drobenare has seen enough parents made misty-eyed by the experience that she has a speech prepared for the perennial June ritual.
Several of the photographs here, which were taken from The New York Times’s archives, show sunny, brochure-ready partings. One, originally printed in June 1959, empathically does not. Instead, it finds a 4-year-old named Claudia Watkins having a moment in Grand Central Terminal.
Claudia is so upset about her brothers leaving for camp that you’re reminded that if you want to cry properly, you’ve really got to put your whole body into it. She has her tiny hand around her brother Miles’s arm. Her mother has bent over, pearls swinging, to reassure her. The fact that Claudia’s hair is identical to her mother’s is moving, as is the relative size of the hatbox that Claudia is clutching, as is the fact that Miles is holding a toy dog. And the expression on the girl’s face? 
She sounds a lot sunnier about this schedule than one might expect.
Both Ms. Buttinger and Ms. Drobenare are proud that children keep coming back to their camps, first as campers and later as counselors. They’re there to oversee what can be a profound moment in the children’s lives, not just to keep the canoes running on time.
