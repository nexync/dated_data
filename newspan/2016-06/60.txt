Congress is getting beat up for its failure to find agreement on gun control in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Orlando, Fla. But on Wednesday, lawmakers will be able to celebrate a rare bipartisan achievement on another issue.
President Obama is scheduled to sign into law the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, an update of toxic substance regulations originally championed by Mr. Lautenberg, the Democratic senator from New Jersey who died in 2013.
The legislation is the first major rewrite of the toxic substance law since it was originally passed in 1976, and it is being hailed as a landmark improvement in protecting the public from dangerous substances. Because of the influence of industry and environmental groups and their deep disagreements over the issue, the legislation was given little chance for success when lawmakers began work last year.
Those on both sides of the fight credit Senator Tom Udall, the low-key New Mexico Democrat who picked up Mr. Lautenbergâ€™s work, for holding together a fragile and ideologically divided group of senators and steering the legislation to passage.
So while the political atmosphere may be pretty toxic in Washington most days, lawmakers managed to overcome it in this particular case.
