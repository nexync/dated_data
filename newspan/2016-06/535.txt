“The Neon Demon,” a ridiculous and puerile movie from the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn, is set in the high-fashion modeling world of Los Angeles. In Mr. Refn’s conception of this milieu, apartments for models don’t exist, and so the fresh-faced, extremely underage aspiring model Jesse (the doe-eyed Elle Fanning) has to shack up in a sleazy Pasadena motel overseen by a shady Keanu Reeves, playing against virtuous type.
Jesse’s beauty and freshness are the envy of other models, who feel washed up as they hit their early 20s. Her allure also awes a gallery of other affected and pretentious people, or rather, thin simulations of affected and pretentious people. Thin simulation is as close to characterization as Mr. Refn can get here. Jesse is an appealing innocent, but after her encounter with the film’s title object (no, really), she changes, hardens. You can tell by the way she swivels her high-heeled foot after a fashion show.
Nicolas Winding Refn narrates a sequence from “The Neon Demon," starring Elle Fanning.
Mr. Refn’s early movies (1996’s “Pusher,” 1999’s “Bleeder”) showed him to be a gifted if willfully outré genre director. But in recent years, and especially in this film, his work looks like that of a technically adept, emotionally stunted adolescent who’s not nearly as bright as he thinks he is, and who is desperate to elicit the concern of his parents.  In addition, it’s offensive.
“The Neon Demon” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying adult guardian or parent) for violence, nudity, cussing, sexuality, moral turpitude and other prominent features of hot garbage.
