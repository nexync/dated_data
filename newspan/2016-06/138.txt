“I sort of long to live in the 1950s or ’60s… or ’70s; I’d take any one of those decades,” muses the denim designer Nicole Najafi. Her pining for classic Americana runs through Industry Standard, her jeans label inspired by unfussy, mid-20th-century silhouettes — and was stoked during a recent, spur-of-the-moment trip to Cuba with her best friend, the artist Mary Corman. “She’s also very nostalgic, perhaps even more than I am. She called me on a Friday and said, ‘It’s about to be summer, and it’s too hot to go then, and who knows how different it’ll be by the fall,’ so we booked it.” And they were en route to Havana two weeks later.
Here, Najafi gives T an exclusive look at her seven-day stay in Cuba.
