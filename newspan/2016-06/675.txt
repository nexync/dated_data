As a lawyer who negotiates employee separation agreements, virtually all of which include nondisparagement clauses, I believe that such provisions should be declared unenforceable on the ground that they violate public policy.
Employers are already protected from defamation, by state law. The purpose of nondisparagement clauses — essentially gag provisions — is to prevent former employees from discussing with one another, the news media and their political representatives the treatment that the former employees honestly believe violates federal, state and local anti-discrimination laws or is damaging to the public interest.
Sending jobs abroad or hiring visa employees are two practices that merit public discussion. Rampant age discrimination against Americans in their 50s and 60s who are laid off and often unable to find new jobs is another. Yet we cannot fully comprehend the scope and effect of such practices because to obtain benefits and severance pay, employees are compelled, through what amounts to economic blackmail, to “shut up,” precluding public discussion and allowing employers to continue destructive policies.
Recognizing that without discussion there can be no action, the National Labor Relations Board has limited the scope of nondisparagement clauses in union shops on the theory that such restrictive clauses impede union organizing.
Surely it is important for the public to be aware of the behavior of employers throughout what has become an increasingly inequitable American workplace. Nondisparagement clauses obstruct such discussions and should be banned.
