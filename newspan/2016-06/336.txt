In another sign that streaming has become the music industry’s most important format, the Grammy Awards have announced a set of eligibility tweaks for next year’s ceremony.
So far the change would seem to have only one major beneficiary: Chance the Rapper, whose mixtape “Coloring Book” made history in May as the first streaming-only release on the Billboard album chart, opening at No. 8. But with artists increasingly experimenting with how they release music online, there could very well be more.
The next Grammy awards, the 59th annual, will be held on Feb. 12, for music released between Oct. 1, 2015, and Sept. 30, 2016. This week the academy also renewed its longstanding broadcast deal with CBS, keeping the awards on that network through 2026.
