Laura Linney and Cynthia Nixon will not just be trading barbs in a new production of “The Little Foxes,” by Lillian Hellman, set for the Manhattan Theater Club next spring — they’ll also be swapping roles.
Echoing a move seen on Broadway in 2000 with the acclaimed production of “True West,” starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly, Ms. Linney and Ms. Nixon will alternate the roles of Regina Hubbard Giddens and Birdie Giddens, two sisters-in-law doing ferocious battle over the family business in Alabama in 1900. Daniel Sullivan, a Tony Award winner in 2001 for “Proof,” will direct the production, which is to begin previews on March 29.
