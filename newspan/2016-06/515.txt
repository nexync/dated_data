BERLIN â€” German officials on Friday said a gunman who was killed after entering a multiplex movie theater in southwestern Germany the day earlier was a 19-year-old German who was born in nearby Mannheim.
The gunman, whose name was not released, entered a cinema in Viernheim on Thursday afternoon wearing a mask and armed with two pellet guns, a rifle, a pistol and a fake hand grenade, prosecutors said. He took four employees and 14 moviegoers, including children, hostage.
Prosecutors in Darmstadt, who are responsible for carrying out the investigation, said in a statement on Friday that they had no indication of a motivation, political or otherwise, but that they had ruled out a terrorism-related motive.
The special police forces who stormed the cinema responded with live rounds, killing the attacker. Despite initial reports of widespread injuries, prosecutors said no one else was harmed in the episode, which had led to fears of a mass shooting.
