A dental therapist, which as you note is “the rough equivalent of a physician assistant,” can greatly improve access to quality dental care, and the benefits of dental therapy practice could be offered more broadly to all Americans.
Nationwide recognition of this emerging profession would increase the supply of practitioners who can provide basic dental services safely and effectively, commensurate with their education, training and experience.
A greater supply of qualified providers would enhance competition, which can yield lower prices, additional service hours, shorter wait times and innovations in care delivery, as we have seen from the increased use of advanced practice nurses and physician assistants.
The Federal Trade Commission has urged the Commission on Dental Accreditation to adopt accreditation standards for dental therapy education programs, a critical step toward developing a nationwide profession.
States would then have to do their part, by adopting licensing pathways that facilitate market entry by dental therapists, so that all consumers — not just those reliant on tribal practitioners — may benefit from enhanced competition.
