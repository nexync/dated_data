But the pope counseled the thousands of people gathered to hear him in Armenia’s capital, Yerevan, to use the healing power of love to transform old wounds into “a wellspring of forgiveness and peace,” and to seek reconciliation with neighboring Turkey.
Francis spoke during a prayer service with the leaders of the Armenian Apostolic Church at the end of the second day of a trip during which he called attention to the slaughter of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Turks from 1915 to 1923. On Friday, the pope departed from a prepared text and referred to the massacre as a genocide, a term that Turkey rejects. Historians have called it the first genocide of the 20th century.
On Saturday, Turkey’s response to the pope’s use of the word was relatively restrained, with Deputy Prime Minister Nurettin Canikli calling the remarks “very unfortunate,” according to The Associated Press.
The last time Francis used the term in reference to the mass deaths of Armenians, in Rome in April 2015, Turkey reacted angrily, recalling its ambassador to the Vatican and not returning the envoy for 10 months.
In a video message he sent to the Armenian people ahead of the trip, the pope made clear that he was visiting as “messenger of peace.” His aim, he said, was to “support efforts on the way to peace,” referring not only to the longstanding strife with Turkey, but also to Armenia’s dispute with Azerbaijan over the province of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Those tensions crept into Saturday’s prayer meeting when Catholicos Karekin II, the supreme patriarch of the Armenian Apostolic Church and spiritual leader of about 93 percent of Armenia’s population of three million people, accused Azerbaijan of bombing Armenian villages in April and violating a tenuous cease-fire.
At the memorial, the pope laid a wreath of yellow and white flowers, the colors of the Vatican, and spent a long moment in prayer.
