“Last year, I clocked 14,500 miles just driving upstate,” says Kate Orne, who crisscrosses from the Catskills to the Berkshires, even down to Connecticut, to interview and photograph subjects for Upstate Diary, the art-oriented publication she launched in 2014. That figure on her odometer is more or less the distance from New York City to New Delhi and back again, and yet Orne betrays not the slightest hint of fatigue as she describes her project with an almost evangelical passion.
Soon after the publication’s debut, Orne also began holding a parallel series of salons to get creatives to come out of the woods (both literally and figuratively), get to know one another and even collaborate. Which is why one recent evening found Orne — who in person is a commanding presence with no shortage of opinions (“Please don’t call Upstate Diary a magazine,” she insists. “It’s a publication, because I see it as something more timeless”) — at the Hillsdale, N.Y., home of the art dealer Paul Morris and his partner, Dr. Sam Grubman. Guests included the artists Duncan Hannah, Josephine Halvorson and Carlos Vega; the photographer Jeannette Montgomery Barron; the young filmmaker Blair Dorosh-Walther; and the gallerist Jack Shainman. As everyone gathered over cocktails and dinner to toast Morris’s new role as an Upstate Diary contributor, talk swirled around living and working in the countryside, and its many joys (the quiet, the beautiful light) as well as challenges (the frigid temperatures).
