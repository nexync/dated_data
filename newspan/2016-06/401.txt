It’s not every day that you get a spot on the London Collections Men schedule straight out of school. Then again, Kiko Kostadinov is far from an average Central Saint Martins student. Though he graduated from the M.A. Fashion course only last month, the 26-year-old men’s wear designer already has a collaboration with Stüssy under his belt, a NEWGEN Men sponsorship — and a yearlong deal to be exclusively stocked at Dover Street Market.
The highly functional collection also features subtle details that nod to his parents. “When I worked with my dad and we would soundproof rooms for radio stations, we would use wooden frames that we’d wrap with soundproof fabric and staple down,” he explains of the process that inspired his “aggressively tie-dyed” shirts. Another poignant detail is his gesture to his mother: a rendition of a Japanese cleaning jacket that has an inner zip-up layer and elasticated smocked cuffs, both of which minimize exposure to skin. “Without sounding dramatic, I get quite worried about her health because she works with so many chemicals,” he says.
Initially rejected from the Central Saint Martins B.A. course, Kostadinov trained with the London-based designer Aitor Throup before sneaking into the college’s Soho campus to help students that he had met along the way. “I knew I wanted to be there,” he says. After being accepted to the Fashion Design and Marketing course, Kostadinov unsuccessfully attempted to transfer to the men’s wear course several times. “It was what motivated me to do a better men’s wear collection than any of the men’s wear designers,” he says with a smile. Throughout his studies, he assisted the stylist Stephen Mann, who introduced the designer to Stüssy and continues to mentor him today.
