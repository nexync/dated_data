The courtyard of the Tribune Tower, home of The Chicago Tribune. Gannett has made an offer worth $864 million to acquire the paper’s owner, the Tribune Publishing Company, which has rejected the bid.
Gannett made one thing clear on Tuesday: It will not walk away from its unsolicited offer to acquire the Tribune Publishing Company before summer’s end.
Tribune Publishing has already rejected both of Gannett’s offers – the latest at a 99 percent premium to the price of Tribune Publishing’s shares in April before news of a potential bid surfaced. The company, which publishes The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune, also brought in a new minority investor and director who could help fend off the takeover.
Reports surfaced that Gannett would abandon its pursuit of Tribune Publishing. Gannett, which owns USA Today, among other media assets, missed the window to nominate its own set of directors, leaving it with fewer tools to put pressure on the board for an immediate sale. It encouraged Tribune Publishing’s shareholders to withhold their votes for the eight director nominees to the company’s board, and when the votes were counted, Gannett demonstrated that many of Tribune Publishing’s shareholders were on its side.
Tribune Publishing held its annual meeting on Thursday. It disclosed on Monday that five of the eight directors received less than 50 percent support from shares that were independent of the company, giving Gannett fuel to continue its battle.
“Gannett values the 11 iconic newspapers of Tribune and has determined to keep its offer in place as it evaluates various near-term developments, including the Tribune second-quarter 2016 financial results, which are expected in August,” Gannett said on Tuesday in a statement.
In its latest offer, Gannett sought to acquire Tribune Publishing for $15 a share, or a total of $864 million, including debt and other liabilities, a proposal that had been put forth in mid-May. Shortly thereafter, Tribune Publishing rejected that bid and brought in a new investor, Nant Capital, whose founder, the health care billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, also became a member of the board.
As part of Tribune Publishing’s stand-alone plan, the company announced on Thursday that it would be renamed Tronc (with a lowercase “t”), which stands for Tribune online content, and switch to the Nasdaq from the New York Stock Exchange. It is an effort to appear to be more of a tech company than a newspaper business.
Gannett is seeking to consolidate the field to broaden its scale to 120 newspapers, and of course, cut costs in the slowly growing – and in some cases, declining — industry.
