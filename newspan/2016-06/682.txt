BISMARCK, N.D. — North Dakota voters on Tuesday rejected a move by the state to loosen its Depression-era rules prohibiting corporate farming.
The North Dakota Farmers Union had led a campaign to overturn the legislature’s decision last year to exempt pork and dairy businesses from the ban on corporate farming.
Supporters of the so-called ham-and-cheese law said it would revitalize dairy and swine farms after years of decline.
Those who opposed the law criticized it is an invitation to large, out-of-state companies to set up operations in North Dakota.
