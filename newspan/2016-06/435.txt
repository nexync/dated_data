Video shared on social media shows the initial moments of a shooting at Dallas Love Field Airport.
A police officer shot a man involved in a domestic dispute outside a baggage claim area at the Dallas Love Field Airport on Friday after the man rushed at him with a rock, an official said.
The official, Assistant Chief Randall Blankenbaker of the Dallas Police Department’s investigations bureau, said the man was taken to the hospital. But his condition was not immediately clear on Friday afternoon.
 The officer tried to intervene, but the man rushed him with a rock in his hand, and the officer fired his weapon several times.
Cellphone video of the shooting scene was uploaded online, and it shows a uniformed man in a bright green vest pointing a gun as travelers scattered and ducked. At least one person could be heard saying, “Oh, my God!” as the shots rang out around noon.
Some witnesses told local news media that nine shots were fired, but Chief Blankenbaker could not confirm that.
The officer will be placed on administrative leave, a routine move after a shooting, the chief said.
Asked whether the man had shouted, ‘“Shoot me,” as some witnesses reported, he said he had no information to verify that.
In an interview with CNN, Bryan Armstrong, who recorded video of the shooting, said the man was told to stop advancing toward the officer or drop the rock. The chief said it was seeking witnesses to the episode and was going to look at all the videos uploaded online.
The airport, about seven miles from downtown Dallas, was not locked down, as some news outlets reported, Chief Blankenbaker said. But because startled travelers fled through the security zone unchecked when the shooting started, officials had to round them up and bring them back out to be rescreened.
Passengers on flights into the city tweeted that their disembarking was delayed because of the shooting. Airport officials were not immediately available for comment.
