The artist Saya Woolfalk has a healthy imagination — one that may be infused with a greater sense of the fantastical than most. In “ChimaTEK: ChimaCloud Control Center,” she creates a virtual world that lives inside the Fulton Center in Lower Manhattan. And if a work can make you forget, even for a few minutes, about the assault of garish pink neon that permeates that transit hub, it’s art.
As three dancers — the piece’s choreographer, Aimee Meredith Cox, as well as Fréyani Patrice and Kenya Joy Gibson — make their way down escalators and a winding staircase to the lower base of the multilevel center, three-dimensional crystals featuring diamond mosaics and propellers dance alongside them.
Some preparation is in order: To see these floating crystals, you must first download the Refrakt application and aim your smartphone on a design on the dancers’ dresses. When it works — and you have to be close enough — a crystal suddenly appears to hover around the dancer’s body. Spookily beautiful, these crystals help you reimagine space and time. Are the dancers impersonating the crystals, or is the crystal a guise? As the barefoot dancers incorporate lush African undulations and hold still positions with such focus and poise that they could be sculptures, even the hectic Fulton Center quiets down.
When they reach ground level, Ms. Cox, the leader of the group, dances before Ms. Patrice and Ms. Gibson while holding an iPad to reveal the crystals; it’s as if she’s demonstrating, wordlessly, how the application works. But the action also enhances the dreamlike quality of the dance in which a duet — with the help of a crystal — becomes a trio. Their exit is most haunting: Ascending escalators, they glide away.
