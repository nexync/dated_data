Donald J. Trump gave a shout-out to an African-American at his rally and talked about the efforts of a black supporter to stop a disruption at a previous event.
REDDING, Calif. — In a speech in which he promoted the backing of Chinese-Americans in Los Angeles and called protesters at a rally in San Jose “thugs,” Donald J. Trump on Friday sought to project support from African-Americans for his campaign on a single man in the audience.
Mr. Trump, at a rally here, began speaking about a previous rally in Arizona in which a black supporter was arrested after punching a protester.
As his voice trailed off, Mr. Trump noticed a man in the crowd.
Mr. Trump then returned to speaking about the Arizona episode.
The man he had pointed to, Gregory Cheadle, a local real estate broker running for a Republican nomination for a congressional seat, said in an interview Friday night that it was “surreal” to be called out by Mr. Trump.
He also clarified that he is not actually a Trump supporter, saying that he went to a Bernie Sanders rally the night before. “I’d describe myself as someone who is searching for answers,” Mr. Cheadle said.
At the Arizona rally Mr. Trump was referring to, a Trump supporter punched a protester wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit as the person was being escorted out.
Judge Curiel was born in Indiana; he is of Mexican descent.
