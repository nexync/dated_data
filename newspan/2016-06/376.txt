The big winner on the music chart this week? Streaming. The loser, if there is one, is sales.
According to Nielsen, “Views” had 105 million streams last week in the United States, still a huge number. Even after two months the only artist to get more streams in a single week was Beyoncé, with “Lemonade.” And if your only competition is Beyoncé, you’re doing pretty good.
Yet by sales of CDs and downloads alone — which until a year and a half ago were the only numbers that mattered — “Views” was far from No.1. This week that distinction is held by the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ new album, “The Getaway” (Warner Bros.), which sold 108,000 copies and had just under 11 million streams. By comparison, “Views” sold just 33,000 copies. By sales alone that would have been good enough for fourth place, but in the new music business, monster streaming numbers can propel an album far up the chart. “The Getaway” was stalled at No.2.
Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” (Parkwood/Columbia) is No. 3, the “Hamilton” cast album (Atlantic) falls one spot to No.4, and Radiohead’s new album, “A Moon Shaped Pool” (XL), rocketed 124 spots to No. 5 in its sixth week out. Why the big jump? It finally became available on Spotify.
Also this week, the rapper YG’s new album, “Still Brazy” (Def Jam), opened at No.6, and “Johannesburg” (Glassnote), an EP recorded in South Africa by the British band Mumford & Sons with the guests Baaba Maal, the Very Best and Beatenburg — three acts based in Africa, or with African roots — starts at No.9.
