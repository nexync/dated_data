Some of the most popular tourist attractions in Paris, like the Louvre Museum, are temporarily closed to visitors because of heavy rains that have caused the Seine River to rise to its highest levels since 1982. But despite these closures, Myriam Guyon, the founder of the Paris-based travel consultancy Voyages Confidentiels, said that tourists currently in the city aren’t lacking in sightseeing options.
“The attractions that are closed are mainly along the Seine River, but the city is fully functioning, and there are dozens of iconic sights that are still open including the Eiffel Tower, the opera house [Palais Garnier] and the Rodin Museum,” she said.
- The Louvre Museum is closed at least through June 7.
- The Orsay Museum is closed at least until June 7, according to its website.
- The Grand Palais was closed on Friday and Saturday but reopened on Sunday.
-The Paris Sewer Museum is closed until further notice.
- No cruises are currently operating on the Seine.
- Some cafes located along the Seine’s quaysides are closed.
- At train and metro stations: according to the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Saint Michel metro and RER station and the station Cluny La Sorbonne are closed to the public; there is no service on the RER C line in Paris, between the stations Paris Austerlitz, Javel and Avenue Henri Martin.
