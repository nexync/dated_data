We are the friends of Leo Van Witsen, a victim of New York University Medical School practices, as described in your article.
We are shocked, appalled and dismayed to learn of Leo’s fate at the hands of N.Y.U., and, indirectly, the Columbia medical school.
We visited Leo’s apartment, shared dinner with him, sang arias with him and loved him. We were his family. Thanks to the mentorship of Leo and his partner, the pianist and translator Robert Hess, we have had careers as singers, actors, pianists, producers and academics.
We have worked on Broadway, at theaters across the country, at opera houses around the world, and at colleges, inspiring next generations in the arts.
We want to see Leo, who died in 2009, brought back from Hart Island. We want to see him treated as he should have been by N.Y.U. We want his ashes so that we may distribute them with those of his lifelong partner, Robert, who died in 2013.
There are many more of us in addition to the two signed here. On behalf of Leo and all the others lost to Hart Island, we thank you for your interest and your article. Please help us bring Leo back to where he belongs.
Any university has a moral duty and powerful practical reasons to respect whatever specific instructions regarding eventual disposition are left to it by people who donate their bodies for research or teaching.
But putting such clearly expressed instructions to one side, I am not sure that I understand the article’s apparent assumption that burying bodies in a common grave is per se less respectful or “dignified” than cremation and scattering of the ashes.
I am also curious why more families who care about their loved ones don’t choose to reclaim their remains and accord them whatever final disposition would be consistent with the deceased’s faith, traditions or beliefs.
