PITTSBURGH — When injuries depleted the Mets’ lineup last summer, they turned first to the Atlanta Braves in a deal for Kelly Johnson, the versatile utility player. They did it again on Wednesday, obtaining Johnson from the Braves for the Class AA pitcher Akeel Morris.
Back with Atlanta this season, Johnson, 34, hit just .215 without his usual power; he had only one home run and six doubles in 132 plate appearances. But he has started games at every infield position and both corner outfield spots over the last two seasons, and gives the Mets a veteran they trust for a lineup that is missing catcher Travis d’Arnaud, first baseman Lucas Duda and third baseman David Wright, who are all injured.
Last year’s deal with the Braves also brought Juan Uribe – who now plays for Cleveland – and signaled that the Mets were serious about upgrading a lineup that soon added Yoenis Cespedes. Johnson hit .250 with five home runs down the stretch and started a game in the World Series.
Morris, 23, had a 4.62 E.R.A. and six saves for Class AA Binghamton. He appeared in one game for the Mets last season.
