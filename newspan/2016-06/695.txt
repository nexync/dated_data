A small, round, not quite ripe watermelon rolled out of a subway passenger’s bag at 5:36 p.m. on the Brooklyn-bound 2 train. It leaned against the closed subway doors and rotated — almost getting off at Atlantic Avenue.
But the doors closed and it found itself a resting place again where the air breathed quietly through the subway door’s crack. It sat for about a minute, until it found its way under the step of a stout woman in her 60s with a short blond crop. The woman grinned as the melon kissed her toes and rustled her blue, tie-dyed chiffon dress.
We all watched as the melon rolled from one end of the car to the other, as the subway abruptly stopped and started. We chuckled. Our smiles and eyes met in this instant community — each one of us peering around to find the melon’s rightful owner.
One young woman stepped away from her husband and her baby carriage to rescue the melon — offering it up. But there were no takers. She offered once again. Then she quietly grasped the melon and placed it among her grocery packages, glanced at her husband and shrugged her shoulders.
We all eyed the melon as it was placed with its foster family and nodded silently — sanctioning the melon’s new home.
