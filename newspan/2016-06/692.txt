Credit...From "Alpha, Bravo, Charlie"
Gillingham, the author and illustrator of picture books including “How to Grow a Friend” and many interactive books for toddlers, brings a stylish and simple graphic style to the pages, with bright colors and sharp shapes along with print-like textures that give the solid colors a vintage feel. For ship-loving children —and those of any age who revel in cracking codes and learning how symbol systems work — “Alpha, Bravo, Charlie” will be an absolute treasure.
“Daytime Visions” from the Argentine musician and author/illustrator Isol (“The Menino”) is another glorious example of how much can be done by playing around with letters. Each one gets a little story of sorts, accompanied by one of Isol’s artfully layered collaged illustrations: black-crayon-like lines and cut paper that covers or dips under the lines to create an energetic, improvisational flow. In her dream-logic world, people and animals mix freely, and even basic words bear a heavy weight of suggestion.
Some of the stories contain simply one word, with the evocative illustration worth another 999 or so. “Insomniac,” the entry for I, for example, shows a big duck with beak pointed down and eyes closed, floating on water with two little ones, also asleep, tucked under its wings. Another duckling glides nearby, its black-rimmed eyes round and awake, its head slightly downturned but not resting. What could have happened to the poor sleepless thing? “R” shows a big bird with flamboyant blue hair dramatically scolding a smaller bird with wings held sheepishly behind its back. “Never meant to be rude,” the words say. Another story you long to know more about.
