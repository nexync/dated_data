Fixing the flaws in our high-skilled immigration system need not wait for comprehensive legislation. In fact, Congressâ€™s continued tolerance of H-1B outsourcing is an obstacle to comprehensive reform, because it is the single most powerful evidence that anti-immigration forces have for the bogus claim that new green-card recipients cost jobs.
This Congress should seize the opportunity to do one simple thing to fix a gaping hole in the system: Repeal the special treatment that Congress provided H-1B outsourcing companies in 1998.
Contractors whose business model is to replace American workers who must train their replacements are actually specifically exempted from the requirement not to displace Americans, provided that they pay a salary that amounts to half the market rate for these jobs.
Narrow language to eliminate this special treatment for H-1B outsourcers could be enacted on any legislation this Congress considers.
