Another hedge fund that was caught up in the federal government’s crackdown on insider trading is getting back money it forfeited to authorities in the course of the investigation.
Federal prosecutors have agreed to return $6 million that Diamondback Capital Management forfeited as part of a nonprosecution agreement, according to a court filing on Friday.
The decision by federal prosecutors to return the money is a rare event, but it represents more fallout from a landmark appeals court ruling that resulted in the dismissal of a number of insider trading convictions, including the conviction of a former portfolio manager at Diamondback.
The court filing by prosecutors working for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, does not specifically refer to the appellate ruling but notes there have been subsequent “legal developments” to the signing of the nonprosecution agreement in January 2012.
This year, the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to return $3 million paid by Diamondback to resolve a related civil investigation.
In January, securities regulators agreed to return $21.5 million in settlement money paid out by another hedge fund, Level Global Advisors, to resolve a related insider trading investigation.
Both Diamondback and Level Global were raided by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2010 as part of a broad crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry that at one point led to the conviction of more than 80 people. Both hedge funds eventually shut their doors.
The investigation led to the filing of insider trading charges against Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback, and Anthony Chiasson, a founder of Level Global. Both men were convicted on insider trading charges, but the appellate court threw out the convictions in a ruling that dramatically narrowed the ability of authorities to pursue certain kinds of insider trading cases.
Mr. Bharara has criticized the appellate ruling in the Newman case and was disappointed when the Supreme Court refused to take the matter up on appeal. And while Mr. Bharara has said he disagrees with the ruling, his office subsequently dismissed convictions and guilty pleas it had obtained against several other people in light of the decision.
The return of money to Diamondback now moves Mr. Bharara’s office one step closer to closing the door on the fallout from the Newman case.
