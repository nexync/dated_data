“’Til Madness Do Us Part” takes place almost entirely on a single floor of a mental hospital in southwestern China, though you might initially be forgiven for thinking that the director, the documentarian Wang Bing (“Tie Xi Qu: West of Tracks”), had discovered hell on earth.
This overlong (nearly four hours) but sporadically extraordinary portrait of a forgotten corner of society may be tough going even for fans of forbidding cinema. Mr. Wang, who shot the movie in 2013, spends inordinate time acclimating viewers to the space and its inhabitants’ rituals. He seems to have favored shots in which the subjects, committed for reasons ranging from the criminal to the arguably nonexistent, ignore the camera — a strategy that raises questions about how the filmmaker was received.
But just as the movie is setting itself up as a modern “Titicut Follies” — Frederick Wiseman’s classic 1967 documentary about a hospital for the criminally insane — “’Til Madness Do Us Part” begins to locate gleams of humanity amid the squalor. A longtime resident says, “In here, a man can eat and sit, sleep if he can, and no one bothers him.” Romance blossoms, and there are fireworks to ring in a new year. The visiting daughter of a new arrival permits another inmate to use her cellphone.
