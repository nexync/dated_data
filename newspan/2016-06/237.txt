The city’s Records Department, in a statement, said it was working to develop rules regarding public access to the documents, though no timetable or process has been set.
The files discovered in Queens are from a secretive police unit that began as the anti-Communist “Red Squad.” During the 1960s, it was called the Special Services Division. Today it is called the Intelligence Division.
Pablo Guzman, an early member of the Young Lords, said he hoped to have a chance to inspect the Police Department’s records on the group, which was the target of extensive surveillance and infiltration, he said.
A lawsuit seeking documents from the New York Police Department includes actual police reports from 1969 and 1970, describing surveillance of the Young Lords.
Civil rights lawyers claimed it reflected a clear effort on the part of the Police Department to stymie public access. “They scrambled the entire system, so it was impossible to find anything,” Mr. Eisenstein said.
When the documents resurfaced this week, among the first to learn of the discovery was Johanna Fernandez, a professor at Baruch College who is writing a book on the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican organization that began as a reformed street gang in Chicago before evolving into a radical social justice movement. She had requested surveillance files relating to the organization from the Police Department as well as from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which she said was far more responsive in providing records.
