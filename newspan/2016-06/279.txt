Had the floors of the St. Paul’s Episcopal Church on Staten Island not been made of slate, the 150-year-old house of worship might have burned to the ground on Sunday, when, the police said, a person threw a burning bottle filled with flammable liquid through an open window. The bottle flamed out on the stone floor.
The First Central Baptist Church a few blocks away, also in the Stapleton neighborhood of the island’s North Shore, was likewise spared destruction on Thursday. Before dawn, someone tossed a similarly crude grenade at a window, but it bounced off and landed on an awning, burning the structure and scorching an exterior wall, the police said. A passing ambulance saw the fire and called for help before the flames spread.
The police are investigating both arson fires as hate crimes, and the same man is believed to be responsible for the two attacks, Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department, said on Friday.
Fire marshals believed the accelerant in the bottles was gasoline, Chief Boyce said, and investigators were canvassing area gas stations and backyards — anywhere people use gasoline — for more evidence.
The hooded suspect was seen in surveillance video crossing the street near the intersection of Van Duzer and Beach Streets, around the corner from the Baptist church after it had been set on fire.
The police, who released the video on Thursday, said the man had not been identified and remained at large.
No one was injured in either attack, and both churches suffered minor damage, the police said.
In a statement on Friday, State Senator Diane J. Savino called the arsonist a “coward” and condemned the “hateful and senseless” attacks.
Michael E. McMahon, the Staten Island district attorney, said his office was monitoring the police investigation.
