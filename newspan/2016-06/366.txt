The roster of the Cuban national baseball team is weighted curiously toward the end of the alphabet. There are Yordanis, Yurisbel, Yunior, Yeniet and Yorbis: more than one-quarter of the 41 players considered for this spring’s historic game against the Tampa Bay Rays in Havana had first names starting with Y.
Lillian Guerra of the University of Florida sees Generación Y as part of a broader tradition of creative naming in Cuba, one she called a sign of cultural resistance. She pointed to unusual monikers like Milaidys, a phoneticization of “My lady” in Spanish; Dianisleysis, inspired by Princess Diana; and, get ready for this, Onedollar, Usnavy, Usmail, Usarmy and Usa, all inspired by Cubans’ increased contact with Americans travelers and culture during the 1990s.
There are signs that Cuban names have been returning to more conventional patterns in the last couple of decades, according to Professor Guerra, who has written about Generación Y. Yoani Sánchez, a famous Cuban dissident who runs a popular blog called Generación Y, wrote in 2010 that “calmer winds have been blowing when it comes time to name a child.” She expressed relief that a friend named her baby Juan Carlos.
