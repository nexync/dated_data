The cause was cancer, his wife, Carolina Gonzalez-Hutton, said.
He later taught filmmaking at a number of schools, including Bard College, where he was the director of the film and electronic arts program, and worked as a professional cinematographer, largely on documentaries — including “Baseball” and “The Statue of Liberty,” directed by Ken Burns, a former student — and independent features.
In addition to his wife, a filmmaker, and his daughter, the pianist Manon Hutton-DeWys, Mr. Hutton is survived by his twin sister, Wendy Hutton, and a brother, William. His marriage to Margaret De Wys, a keyboardist in the band Theoretical Girls, ended in divorce.
The Museum of Modern Art in New York held an 18-film retrospective of his work in 2008. A 2010 critics’ poll organized by Film Comment magazine ranked Mr. Hutton’s “At Sea” (2004-7), an hourlong chronicle of a giant container ship from its creation in South Korea to its destruction in Bangladesh, the best avant-garde film of the decade.
