“What if everything we think is real is just an illusion?” began A. O. Scott’s review of the 1973 made-for-German-TV movie by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, “Welt Am Draht” (in English, “World on a Wire”). Now, the title of that sci-fi film has been repurposed by the collector Julia Stoschek for the inaugural show in her new Berlin space, which brings together a contingent of multimedia artists who are likewise reevaluating the meaning of reality — this time in the digital era. The works — which include videos, live simulations, performances and sculptures — range from satirical cultural commentaries to visualizations of future metropolises. Here, three of the creators, all born in the mid-’80s, explain their contributions.
The formally trained painter abandoned the medium after feeling “endlessly up against a wall,” she says. “I couldn’t figure out how to use painting as a tool for all of the topics that I thought were so urgent to explore” — so she switched to documentary filmmaking. However, in lieu of straightforward chronicling, the New York-based Rose compresses subjects and her own sentiments. Her post-Hurricane Sandy and global-warming-related anxieties sparked the making of “A Minute Ago,” featured in the Stoschek exhibition.
