On a recent and sweltering afternoon in SoHo, Robin Standefer of Roman and Williams — the design company she runs with her husband, Stephen Alesch — plucked some peppermint from an outdoor planter on Lafayette Street. She wandered inside, motioned for me to sit on a banquette and later urged her friend to share a clip from his iPhone of his young daughter singing animal sounds. That friend happened to be chef Daniel Rose — of the Parisian hotspot Spring — and we were inside what will soon be his first stateside restaurant, Le Coucou. It was designed by Standefer and Alesch, and got its name from the small voice chirping in Rose’s palm.
From there, Standefer and Alesch clung to the idea of a rambling home. They sculpted archways, installed triple-hung glass windows, collected vintage Thonet chairs and found frog glass lighting fixtures by Helena Tynell. The bar resembles a kitchen counter — “it’s not a ‘bar-scene’ bar, we don’t want a bar to always look like it’s from the movie ‘Cocktail,’” Standefer says — situated in front of an antique oak door updated with shelving. And a hand-painted mural on the surrounding walls is based on the work of the 18th-century French landscape painter Hubert Robert.
As usual, Standefer and Alesch custom-designed certain objects, specifically, cast-iron chandeliers with hand-blown glass shades as well as a series of bronze candleholders. And the planters full of culinary greens that line the sidewalk out front reflect the couple’s own home garden; they say they would happily offer up some radicchio for Rose’s plates.
