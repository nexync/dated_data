Vandals with spray-paint struck a towering new artwork that was recently opened to the public in the desert outside of Las Vegas, forcing the site around the sculptures to be closed on Monday and Tuesday so the graffiti could be cleaned off, officials with the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno said.
The work, “Seven Magic Mountains,” a collection of Day-Glo-colored stacked boulders near Jean Dry Lake south of the city, was created by Ugo Rondinone with the help of the museum and the Art Production Fund, the New-York-based public-art organization. The totem-like sculptures, inspired by natural hoodoo rock formations in Utah, have been attracting hundreds of visitors over the past few weeks and generating a huge reservoir of desert-themed, colorful selfies on Instagram.
Amanda Horn, a spokeswoman for the museum, said that the damage — which included misogynistic slurs and profanity and depictions of genitalia — was believed to have occurred between 10:30 p.m. Saturday and early Sunday morning at the site, which is monitored by workers and local police, but not round-the-clock. The limestone boulders were coated in a clear, anti-graffiti protective layer before they were put in place, so the cleanup is expected to go quickly, without any need to repaint the sculptures, Ms. Horn said.
