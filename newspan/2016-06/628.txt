Scott Rudin, a prolific and powerful producer on Broadway and in Hollywood, has withdrawn from a much-anticipated project to adapt the popular movie “Groundhog Day” into a stage musical.
The development is abrupt and unexpected, occurring just weeks before the show is scheduled to begin performances at the Old Vic Theater in London. “Groundhog Day” is collaboration between the songwriter Tim Minchin and the director Matthew Warchus, following their success with “Matilda the Musical.” The new musical is scheduled to run there from July 15 to Sept. 17, and had been scheduled to begin performances on Broadway next January; it is not clear how Mr. Rudin’s withdrawal might affect the transfer.
In an emailed statement, Mr. Rudin suggested that he was not satisfied with his ability to influence the evolving show, and had opted to move on. He has plenty on his plate: He has already announced that he will be producing revivals of “The Front Page” and “Hello, Dolly!” on Broadway this season, and is expected to announce a revival of “The Glass Menagerie” as well.
The withdrawal was confirmed by two other producers, Lia Vollack, of Sony Pictures, and André Ptaszynski, of Whistle Pig Productions.
Mr. Rudin announced the “Groundhog Day” project in April 2015. He has an ongoing relationship with the Old Vic, in the form of a right of first refusal to commercial transfers of the theater’s work. Mr. Warchus is the Old Vic’s artistic director.
A spokeswoman for the Old Vic did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
