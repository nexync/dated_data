The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on Wednesday denied a request to reconsider arguments aimed at altering the settlement between the N.F.L. and thousands of former players who said the league hid from them the dangers of concussions.
In April, a three-judge panel in the Third Circuit unanimously affirmed the approval of the settlement, which provides up to $5 million to individual players with severe neurological diseases.
Some players who objected to the settlement asked the larger panel of appeals court judges to hear their plea, which focuses primarily on how chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease, is treated in the settlement. In the deal, only the heirs of players who died from 2006 to April 2015 and were found to have had the disease can receive payments of up to $4 million.
In a one-page decision, Thomas L. Ambro, one of the judges on the three-judge panel that heard the original appeal, said the majority of judges in the court were not in favor of rehearing the case.
The players seeking to alter the settlement can take their case to the Supreme Court, but their chances of getting a hearing there are even slimmer.
No money will be paid out until all appeals are exhausted. Several dozen players who opted out of the settlement can continue to sue the league, and the league is still fighting with its insurers, which want to determine how much of the settlement they have to cover, if any.
