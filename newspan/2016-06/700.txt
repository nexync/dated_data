Once there were just nomads, their wanderings no more than necessary for survival. But then came the stockades their successors built and the fire-warmed ­settlements in which they huddled — and suddenly travel changed, becoming what for most would henceforth be a pursuit more elective than essential. There were many motives for it. Sheer curiosity — what’s beyond the fence? — came first. Then a need to trade, to inhabit, to conquer, to preach, to take part in a pilgrimage, to migrate and settle anew, to wage a war or to seek refuge. These and any of a thousand other proddings of the sharp stick would send travelers out on the road.
Before long, humankind had been whipped into a frenzy of wandering, one that has never let up. And nowadays, with technology and low cost combining to create a perfect storm of wanderlust, we see the results: the vast Lunar New Year crowds at a Chinese railway station, the lethal scrums at the hajj in Mecca, the endless security lines at Heathrow and Kennedy and Sheremetyevo, all vivid testimony to the unanticipated backwash of our pathological desire for ceaseless mobility. And yet just why, fretted Blaise Pascal back in the 17th century, when all of this seemed to get going, why the urge to engage in so much movement? Why all this transnational Brownian motion? Surely all of man’s ills must stem, the philosopher wrote, from his simple inability to remain quiet and alone, serenely in the comfort of his own home.
A former cult member tries to bicycle around the world. A man with an appetite for fish walks the coast of India, sampling as he goes. A Canadian waitress who swears like a fishwife goes on holiday to Boracay. A man walks, illegally, along the Keystone XL pipeline. Sixteen schoolboys canoe their way from Montreal to the mouth of the Mississippi. An Englishman visits all of the Central Asian “stans” — except the most interesting one, Turkmenistan, with its revolving statue of the former president and an ice rink built in the desert. An expatriate Briton writes admiringly about Holland. A Hungarian writes similarly about China. Someone writes a sentence that includes the words “the atopic character of literary space” and supposes it will appeal to a reviewer of travel books. An oenophile goes in search of the finest wines grown in Georgia, not here but in the Caucasus. A Floridian who has visited more than 60 countries tells us about himself. A radio reporter immerses herself in the dubious delights of the Russian city of Chelyabinsk.
In the end, I sifted what I thought might be some pearls from the sand. And there’s an irony in my first choice, one Pascal would like, since Philip Marsden’s RISING GROUND: A Search for the Spirit of Place (University of Chicago, $27.50) doesn’t require the author to venture very far from his home in Cornwall, yielding a travel book that involves little real, physical travel. And yet Marsden’s essays about landscape and history and the habitations and habitants of that mysterious, familiar but deeply unknown fingerlike peninsula at England’s lower left-hand, seagirt end are deft and exquisite, filled with the learning of a supremely well-traveled man and composed in a lilting, finely chased prose.
If deep and well-weathered erudition defines Marsden’s book, learning and assimilated high culture ­similarly mark out Andrew Dickson’s wonderfully imaginative WORLDS ELSEWHERE: Journeys Around Shakespeare’s Globe (Holt, $35), which appropriately appears around the 400th anniversary of William Shakespeare’s death. For this, unlike most of the library-bound literary reassessments produced to mark the moment, demands of Dickson many thousands of miles of hard slogging as he seeks to inquire into the playwright’s appeal around the world and to discover the plays being performed with often wild and eccentric enthusiasm in the most improbable places.
China is perhaps one of the more predictably bardolatrous countries Dickson visits, where young Chinese (they and their elders raised on the Lambs’ “Tales,” still hugely popular more than a century after they appeared in translation) have become in recent years among the most numerous and raucous fans of the man officially known as Shashibiya. Dickson reminds us that when Wen Jiabao, then China’s premier, came to England in 2011, he flew first to a small airport outside Birmingham and hared off to Stratford to pay homage. He left behind as a gift an edition of “Love’s Labour’s Lost” rendered into putonghua and wrote an elegantly calligraphed paean, “He brings sunshine to your life, / Gives your dreams wings to fly” — which, though more Elton John than Li Bai, does suggest a certain fondness. And given that Marx revered Shakespeare, it was for much of China’s recent history an officially approved fondness.
So Dickson treks around to experience Shakespeare with Chinese characteristics — notably watching an up-to-date “Coriolanus” being performed in Beijing, with two local heavy-metal bands called Suffocated and Miserable Faith playing a noisy continuo. In Shanghai, he meets a once and now again famous Shakespearean actor, Jiao Huang, and watches him weep as he explains why he had not been on the stage for nine years during the 1960s. It was, of course, the time of the Cultural Revolution. “If you were passionate about Western plays, you would be so severely criticized that you couldn’t lift your head. . . . I lived in a cowshed. I experienced everything. My house was destroyed.” Such an encounter, which amply repays the price of admission, also transmutes a Shakespeare book (in which Dickson also ventures to Nevada City, Munich, Durban, Kolkata and Gdansk, among other cities) into a true travel book, of the best kind.
Of a more traditional kind is WALKING THE NILE (Atlantic Monthly, $26) by Levison Wood. I mean no disrespect for the behatted, bandannaed and be-bearded Wood, who was bred by all appearances out of Bear Grylls by Sir Ranulph Fiennes, when I note that, like all too many of the newly empireless British, he has a perverse liking for far-flung epic stunts — his other travel book, WALKING THE HIMALAYAS (Little, Brown, $27), comes out almost simultaneously. What elevates this perfectly reasonable 4,000-mile northbound wander through Africa, from the trickle of the river’s source in Rwanda to where it debouches by the grubby gravel of an Egyptian beach, is how Wood deals with the very lowest point of the trip, when one of his party falls desperately ill and dies.
He was dying of hyperthermia. Wood knew the symptoms, had seen them before in Afghanistan. He got out his satellite phone and called — for medical advice, for a helicopter, for help. Gunshots were fired in the air. But no one came. One of his companions lit a fire to create a landing zone for a chopper, but lit it in the wrong place, and the wind-whipped flames swept toward the party and their fast-dying charge. They tried to carry him out, but he stopped breathing, his pulse vanished. They took his fast-cooling body to the top of a hill, wrapped him in a tarp and whispered a prayer. And then, the next day, after the rangers had come and the formalities had been completed in the closest town, Power’s photographer picked up his cellphone and dialed the New York number of Power’s wife. And told her the terrible news about her husband’s death, about what happened to the man who had come out to Africa, as Wood puts it, “so that he could write about me on my indulgent, pointless, selfish trek.” I was near tears when I read that passage. It cast a shadow over the adventure, from which neither the adventure nor the book’s eventual account ever really recovered.
Near the start of what turned out to be an absorbing and well-told tale, Bensen refers to Baudelaire’s admiration for the life of the flâneur, citing the “immense joy” of being able “to be away from home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home; to see the world, to be at the center of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world.” And with gusto, courage and a palpable sense of joy, so Bensen goes on to enjoy her brief wander through the southeastern corner of Europe, as far away from Texan certainty as her budget allowed her to go.
We learn perhaps a little too much about her feminine plumbing crises en route and the history of her various low-level mental troubles back home among her evangelically minded family. But she arrives back in Texas with her relationship with Jeff intact and her eyes widened to the wondrous realities of the world. I was happy for her, and I hope she travels once more, returning with another well-furnished notebook.
Finally, and by deliberate sartorial contrast, there is Rush Loving Jr.’s THE WELL-DRESSED HOBO: The Many Wondrous Adventures of a Man Who Loves Trains (Indiana University, $35), which has all too many pictures of the boring-­looking men in business suits who ran, for good or for ill, some of the various railroads with which this former Fortune editor is acquainted. Loving loves trains — indeed, some years ago he wrote a book with a title professing just that — and he has a stiffly mannered ­approach to the delights of permanent-way passage, the kind that made E.M. Frimbo so beloved a character of the old New Yorker.
His is by no means a good book — neither a good bad book nor a bad good book. But for those few of us who are attracted to a sentence that begins, “Then the Golden Arrow took off over the flatlands of the Midwest, highballing for Chicago, passing Crestline at 12:44, Fort Wayne at 2:02 and Valparaiso at 3:54,” it is an essential book. And how much nicer a sentence that is than all that life-ruining piffle about the atopic character of literary space, an indigestible confection that deserves to be tossed from one of Loving’s trains, to languish by the wayside forever.
