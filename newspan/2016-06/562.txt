Abba fans were giddy.
Thirty years since the legendary Swedish pop band last performed together, news reports said the quartet had reunited for a single song during a private party in Stockholm on Sunday.
The event was held to celebrate 50 years since the songwriting partners Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus first met. At some point during the evening, the other half of the group, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Faltskog, got onstage and performed “The Way Old Friends Do,” with the two men joining in toward the end, the Swedish tabloid Expressen reported.
I almost started crying on my way to school and it's not because I'm graduating tonight it's because ABBA might go on tour!!!!!
But it wasn’t so, said Carl Magnus Palm, an Abba historian who attended the party. The women had indeed performed together, but the men went up on the stage to give them a hug only after they had finished, he said.
“They never sang together, the four of them,” according to Mr. Palm, who said he had double-checked his memory with other attendees.
If true, it stands little chance of making nonbelievers of fans who are clinging to the version of events that has raced around the globe and has been forged thousands of times over in the crucible of social media.
Fans exhilarated by the possibility that the performance on Sunday could presage a comeback tour have been imploring the group on its Facebook page. “Please please,” one person said. Let’s start a petition, another proposed.
They will probably have to, Mr. Palm said.
Abba, which was made up of two married couples, has been steadfast in its refusal to reunite since a breakup in the early 1980s, after both pairs had divorced.
“They want to be remembered as they were back then,” Mr. Palm said.
Even the appearance of the four together on Sunday was rare. The roughly 300 guests were also treated to a mini-reunion of Mr. Andersson and Mr. Ulvaeus, who performed “Does Your Mother Know” earlier in the evening, Mr. Palm said.
