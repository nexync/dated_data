Earlier this month, the Istanbul International Arts and Culture Festival, known as IST. Festival, brought together an eclectic mix of international artists and fashion folk for a three-day program of symposia, film screenings and live performances. But for three women of the Fendi family, the festival also presented a rare opportunity to reunite for a family trip.
Both generations present felt an immediate affinity with Istanbul. “I love cities with water — I am Roman and Turkish, and water is very important: water gives me energy,” says Silvia, who has been to the city only once before with her own mother, when she was a child. “I do feel there is something in my DNA, something reconnecting,” adds Delfina.
