As the television news business — the programs that report it and those that mock it — braces for the presidential conventions next month, one correspondent at “The Daily Show” has determined that this is as good a time as any to exit the series.
Ms. Williams said in an interview in Entertainment Weekly that she would focus on a scripted TV series she is working on for Comedy Central under a development deal there, adding, “I feel like I’m growing up and graduating.” She also continues to host “2 Dope Queens,” a comedy show and storytelling podcast, with Phoebe Robinson.
