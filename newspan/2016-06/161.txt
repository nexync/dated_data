Child soldiers. Abductions. Infant mortality. Earthquakes. Caches of Kalashnikovs — in teenage hands.
Shortages of food, water, electricity. Hospitals where surgeons operate without water, gloves, antibiotics or soap.
During his first months on the job, The Times’s Andes bureau chief Nicholas Casey experienced a full spectrum of disasters.
In this podcast, Nick, who is stationed in Caracas, Venezuela, but was briefly in New York, talks about his experience in and reporting on a country on the brink of collapse.
Highlights of the discussion include Nick’s description of the week he spent at a jungle camp with members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a guerrilla group that has been engaged in a 50-year conflict with the government during which more than 220,000 lives have been lost.
Nick’s remarks provide a sharp, birds’-eye view of a Times foreign correspondent in action.
