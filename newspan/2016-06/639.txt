Guilty admission: I didn’t make it beyond Episode 2 of Netflix’s “Bloodline” when the series premiered in March 2015. Despite an ensemble of actors I love — Sam Shepard, Sissy Spacek, Ben Mendelsohn and Kyle Chandler — something about its languid pacing required more patience than I had to give. But during a boat trip through the Florida Keys in January, I grew familiar with the rhythm of the islands, their placid waters hiding jagged outcroppings that can easily draw blood. And soon I was lured back into the lair of the Rayburns, those good people who keep doing bad, bad things.
Season 2 finds Danny Rayburn dead but not buried, a phantom menace haunting his siblings’ dreams — not just those of his protector turned murderer John (Mr. Chandler), brazenly campaigning for county sheriff, but also the lawyer Meg (Linda Cardellini) and boatyard owner Kevin (Norbert Leo Butz), both spiraling into substance abuse as they confront their complicity in the cover-up.
Then there’s the matriarch Sally (Ms. Spacek), forced to consider the cracks in her clan’s picture-perfect veneer by the arrival of some unsavory characters: Danny’s secret son, Nolan (Owen Teague); Nolan’s mother, Evangeline (Andrea Riseborough); and her boyfriend, Ozzy Delvecchio (John Leguizamo), one of Danny’s former partners in crime.
“Bloodline” is nothing if not an exercise in mood, and this time I went with the flow, savoring the balmy air and growing stench, sometimes piling on two or three episodes a night. Binging created the momentum needed to glide past holes in the story line that strained credulity. Parents so brutality disconnected from an adult child living all of two hours away? A boy hidden from his family by his grandfather for close to 18 years? The murder was the least of it. Still, I’m glad I stayed until the end. Are you? And if there’s a third season, will you be back? Let’s discuss.
• First things first: I longed for more of Mr. Mendelsohn’s Danny, so heartbreakingly divisive the first season as he pleaded for sympathy one moment then sneeringly gutted us the next. It really makes you wonder what the show’s creators, Todd A. Kessler, Glenn Kessler and Daniel Zelman, were thinking when they killed off the best thing they had. Do we agree that this was a misstep, even if Danny, in diluted form, is still loitering on the fringes?
• Mr. Mendelsohn earned an Emmy nomination in Season 1 as did Mr. Chandler, though his John was the most lackluster of all the siblings. But I was impressed by John’s menacing desperation this season, compounded by his perverse audacity to expose himself to scrutiny in his bid for sheriff. And that scene in which he almost shoots Eric O’Bannon (Jamie McShane) — wow. Should Mr. Chandler be an Emmy contender once again?
• Also, props to Mr. Butz, who plays a cocaine addict, and Ms. Cardellini, who portrays a drunk, each with aplomb. Alas, poor Ms. Spacek, so dimwitted an inn owner — I mean, how hard is it to fix that shower in Bungalow 3? — is underused, despite a couple of fine grandmotherly moments. She does look great in her hippie shades and weathered beach garb, though.
• And what of the show’s newest grifters? The terrific Ms. Riseborough and Mr. Teague, playing mother and son, could be downright terrifying. (Meanwhile, I kept hoping that John would find a way to run the annoying Ozzy out of town.) But are they faceted and interesting enough to make up for the loss of Danny?
• Let’s talk language. The novelist Dennis Lehane (“Mystic River,” “Gone, Baby, Gone”) was brought as a writer this season. Critics have likened the resulting tone to mildly literary beach reading, though some think the prestige TV trappings just make “Bloodline” seem better than it actually is. Thoughts?
• And finally, the ending/non-ending, with John’s demons on full display as he roars out of town. If there’s not a Season 3, are we satisfied with the way the series wrapped up? And what do you imagine John is up to right now, after all that?
