To the many tributes pouring in from around the world honoring Muhammad Ali, add one from his hometown orchestra and its energetic young maestro.
Then Ali died on June 3 at the age of 74. Since then Mr. Abrams has led an impromptu tribute to Ali, playing “Amazing Grace” at a makeshift memorial outside Louisville’s Muhammad Ali Center, and now he has teamed with Jim James, who plays guitar with the Louisville-based rock band My Morning Jacket, to record a tribute to Ali.
The new composition by Mr. Abrams, called “Float Rumble Rest,” is an instrumental work a little longer than eight minutes long. Mr. Abrams plays keyboards and Mr. James guitar on the piece, being released Friday by sonaBLAST! Records, a local label. All proceeds from the recording are to benefit the Ali Center, a museum dedicated to preserving Ali’s legacy and promoting respect, hope and understanding.
“As a Louisvillian and a musician, I wanted to offer an artistic tribute to the legendary figure that has inspired, influenced and captivated humanity in the modern era,” Mr. Abrams said in a statement.
Some of the ideas in “Float Rumble Rest” will probably inform next season’s orchestral work — which is to fuse many styles, including jazz and rap, and to include Ali’s own words. The work will be a centerpiece of the orchestra’s new Festival of American Music in April.
