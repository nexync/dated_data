The collector Leon Black is the legal victor in a dispute over the ownership of a famed Picasso sculpture and will take possession of it.
On Wednesday, the parties who had been fighting over the plaster bust of the artist’s muse (and mistress) Marie-Thérèse Walter, announced that they had agreed that Mr. Black would get to keep the work, “Bust of a Woman,” and a rival owner, representing the Qatari royal family, would receive financial compensation of an undisclosed amount.
A settlement had been announced in May, but the court did not disclose any details regarding who would keep the sculpture.
In a legal action filed in January against the Qatari family’s agent, Mr. Gagosian said that he had bought the 1931 sculpture in May 2015 for about $106 million from Picasso’s daughter Maya Widmaier-Picasso, and then sold it to Mr. Black, who expected to receive it after the closing of the Museum of Modern Art’s acclaimed “Picasso Sculpture” show — in which the piece was featured — on Feb. 7.
But Pelham Holdings, the agent for the Qatari family, run by Guy Bennett, maintained in its own court documents that it had secured an agreement with Ms. Widmaier-Picasso to buy the work in November 2014 for 38 million euros, or about $42 million, on behalf of Sheikh Jassim bin Abdulaziz al-Thani, who is married to Sheikha al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, chairwoman of the Qatar Museums Authority.
The seller, in both cases, was Ms. Widmaier-Picasso, 80, who apparently sold the artwork twice.
