It was wonderful to read about Vassar’s success in creating a more diverse and affordable educational experience during Catharine Bond Hill’s term as president (“A Focus on Diversity,” Education Innovation, special section, June 23).
But under her watch, Vassar has also developed quite the reputation for its hostile campus climate characterized by intellectual bullying and profound narrow-mindedness — a kind of tyranny of the majority.
As an alumnus (class of 1983), I think that it is a real shame that Vassar, like so many other ultraprogressive liberal arts colleges, seems to value the kind of diversity that can be seen but not the kind that can be heard.
