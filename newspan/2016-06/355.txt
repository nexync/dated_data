During a late 1960s summer, I was a page at the New York Public Libraryâ€™s 44th Street annex, which housed research collections and periodical archives. At the time, the library owned one of the few complete United States patent collections. My main job was fulfilling requests and reshelving materials.
My most regular customer, along with the morning callers who requested copies of The Daily Racing Form before heading to Aqueduct, was an older gentleman in a blue suit who would spend the day requesting his maximum of four volumes of patents at a time. He was searching for a patent his uncle had been granted for an electronic tube that was ripped off by a big electronics maker he was suing.
Then, there were more than three million patents. I wondered if, in a moment of weariness, he might have skipped over the patent.
A few years later, I visited the annex for college-related reasons, and the man in the blue suit was there, perusing his usual four volumes of patents. I hope he found what he was looking for.
