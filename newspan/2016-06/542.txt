A voracious reader, Humeau is often inspired by books. FOXP2, which gives this new exhibition its name, is a gene associated with the beginning of language — which, as Jared Diamond argues in “The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal,” is ultimately responsible for humanity’s domination of the planet. Diamond’s book, paired alongside a researcher’s personal account of an elephant death ritual, led Humeau to delve into the fantasy of what would happen if elephants had beat humans in the evolution game.

The elephants stand upon an even more incomprehensible object: a rug dyed with all the chemicals contained in the human body. “It’s like a soulless body, or humans before they actually evolved, a primordial soup,” Humeau says. There is an audio component to the tableau: a chorus of reenacted early Homo sapiens’ voices fills the room, representing the first mutation of FOXP2. As with her prehistoric opera, the sound creates another disembodied presence in the space.
