Connelly Theater, 220 E. Fourth St.
Some impersonations don’t need to be very precise. What comedian doesn’t have a lazy Mae West or Arnold Schwarzenegger in the kit bag that’s good for a quick, cheap laugh? But if you’re going to presume to resurrect the Marx Brothers in a full-length stage musical, your Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo had better be spot on.
The delightful “I’ll Say She Is” at the Connelly Theater clears that bar easily, transporting its audiences back to the days of bad puns and zany incongruities as only the Marx Brothers could deliver them. The show is a theatrical labor of love for Noah Diamond, who has spent years researching and trying to recreate “I’ll Say She Is,” the Marx Brothers’ first Broadway show.
Mr. Diamond showed off a rough version of his efforts at the New York International Fringe Festival in 2014. Here, the resurrected show gets a full production by a cast of more than 20, directed by Amanda Sisk, who is married to Mr. Diamond and does a fine job of complementing his historical scholarship with a very Marx-like romp.
Mr. Diamond himself plays Groucho, and he might as well be Groucho. Matt Roper’s Chico and Seth Shelden’s Harpo are also meticulous, and Matt Walters completes the quartet with the less well-known Zeppo, the male romantic lead in the story but certainly not the center of attention.
What plot there is involves a society ingénue (Melody Jane) who finds her privileged life boring. The four Marxes come to her aid, leading her on a ludicrous tour of New York that includes scenes in Central Park, on Wall Street, in an opium den and, after things go awry, in a courtroom.
But never mind the story; this is a vaudeville hodgepodge at heart, with a little bit of everything thrown in: chorus line numbers, ballets, love songs, a harp solo for you-know-who. It’s all light as a feather, underscoring just how much tastes in humor have changed, even as it reminds us how brightly the Marx Brothers’ brand of lunacy once blazed.
