Senator Harry Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell often have unkind things to say about each other’s Senate leadership skills. But Mr. Reid, the Democratic minority leader from Nevada, says he is becoming increasingly impressed by Mr. McConnell’s skills of persuasion as the majority leader. Sort of impressed, anyway.
In an interview, Mr. Reid said he doubted he could have ever persuaded his fellow Democrats to go on a “fool’s errand” such as stonewalling the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland, refusing to schedule hearings and in multiple cases deciding against even a courtesy meeting with the nominee.
Mr. Reid added that he believed the Republican refusal to take up the Garland nomination has already put Democratic contenders ahead in some Senate races.
But it is doubtful that Mr. Reid will want to apologize in this case for complimenting Mr. McConnell’s abilities. Sort of.
