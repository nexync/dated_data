LONDON — Amid worries that “Brexit” had taken the air out of the art market, Sotheby’s at its evening contemporary sale on Tuesday provided a shot of oxygen when a painting by Jenny Saville sold for 6.8 million British pounds, or about $9 million, to the Long Museum, Shanghai for its forthcoming exhibition of women artists — a record at auction for the British artist.
A mix of currency discount and collectors looking for a safe haven may have helped Sotheby’s, which sold 87 percent of its 46 lots, bringing a total of £52.2 million, or about $69.4 million, slightly above the pre-sale high estimate of £50 million, or $66.4 million,with bidders from 41 countries.
Still, that was a marked decline from last year’s comparable sale of £130.4 million, or $204.7 million, though that had 58 lots.
The Sotheby’s results came on the heels of a sale at Phillips on Monday night where an Anselm Kiefer sold to a telephone bidder for £2.4 million, or roughly $3.2 million — four times the high estimate. Christie’s contemporary evening sale comes on Wednesday.
The underbidder on the Saville was Larry Gagosian, whose gallery represents Ms. Saville and is currently showing her work at its Davies Street gallery here.
American and Asian collectors who came looking for bargains at the London auctions this week in light of the depreciated pound may have been disappointed. A number of the works sold for more than their high estimates, including Keith Haring’s 1989 “The Last Rainforest,” which sold for £4.2 million, or $5.6 million, to a telephone bidder represented by the Sotheby’s executive Amy Cappellazzo after intense back and forth with Gabriela Palmieri, chairwoman of contemporary art at Sotheby’s Americas, who was on the phone with another bidder.
“The Last Rainforest” has been in the collection of the photographer David LaChapelle since it was first acquired from the Tony Shafrazi Gallery in 2001.
Three works by Jean Dubuffet brought strong prices, including “Barbe de Lumiere des Aveugles” from 1959, which sold for £3.2 million, about $4.2 million.
The artist Adrian Ghenie continued his winning streak, with his painting “The Hunted” (2010) selling for £1.9 million, or about $2.5 million, and his “Self-Portrait as a Monkey” (2011) for £665,000, or about $886,000, triple its pre-sale estimate.
The night’s exchange rate was 1.33 pounds to the dollar — down 10 percent from 1.49 on Thursday, the day of the European Union referendum.
