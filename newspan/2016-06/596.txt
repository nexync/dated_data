“Zika Testing Lags for a Group Both Vulnerable and Hard to Track” (front page, June 18) highlighted the need for improved education and outreach, expanded research and development of new tests, and an adequately resourced public health work force to confront the spread of the virus here and abroad.
As infectious disease physicians, we see the vulnerabilities the article notes in New York, posing challenges in effectively confronting Zika across the country. The onset of mosquito season will greatly add to those challenges, particularly if we don’t act now.
As of mid-June, Zika had spread to 60 countries, resulting in rising rates of microcephaly in newborns, other neurological effects including Guillain-Barré syndrome, and increased miscarriages and stillbirths. With no mosquito-borne transmission of Zika in the continental United States yet, we have already seen 819 travel-associated cases.
The article makes clear that we are not prepared for the inevitable escalation of cases this summer. Last February, President Obama sent Congress an emergency request for funding to combat Zika. Public health demands leadership in a time of such crisis. Congress must act.
