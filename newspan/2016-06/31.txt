Prince asks me to take a “before” selfie and leaves to give me some privacy while I pose, reminding me of a doctor ducking out of an exam room so I can change into a paper gown.  Then, as instructed, I sit in the salon chair, facing away from the mirror.
I tell myself I won’t gasp and cover my mouth when I look in the mirror, but I do it anyway. The extra moment it takes me to recognize my own reflection is profoundly disorienting. I’m looking at a stranger. Prince has broken a cardinal rule of makeup: bilateral symmetry. My face is unevenly divided between two clashing shades of foundation, and my lipstick switches abruptly from blue-black to crimson. My eyebrows are definitely not twins — they’re not even third cousins. The overall effect is part punk, part glam and undeniably fierce.
As I try out my best rock-and-roll sneer for the “after” selfie, I realize how boring and safe my daily look has become. My devotion to all things sheer, natural and minimal now seems less refined and more like a failure of imagination. “You might hate this, but at least it will be an experience that helps you gain perspective,” Prince assures me. “My goal is that people walk down the street afterward slightly flustered and more aware of their surroundings.” But I don’t hate it: I borrow the wig and wear it on the G train, all the way home.
