In a blow to Mayor Bill de Blasio, a state court on Monday halted his plan to give certain homeowners a $183 credit on their water and sewer bill.
Justice Carol R. Edmead of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the actions of the water board in authorizing the one-time payment along with a general rate increase was “an abuse of discretion” and exceeded the board’s authority.
Mr. de Blasio heralded the water bill credit in an April news conference and has since promoted the measure as an action his administration was taking to help New York homeowners.
The administration argued that the credit, which was to apply only to one- to three-family homes, was made possible by the city’s decision to no longer request a “rental payment” from the water board, an independent public benefit corporation, leaving it with a surplus.
Three Brooklyn real estate companies and the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord group, filed a petition in court to stop the city’s proposal, which also included a rate increase of 2.1 percent and was set to go into effect on July 1. The rate increases would have affected landlords across the city, most of whom would not receive the credit, and by extension their renters.
“The sole purpose of the rate increase was to fund this bill credit,” said Michael Berengarten, a partner at Herrick, Feinstein, who represented the plaintiffs.
The court agreed with the plaintiffs’ legal arguments, if not their political analysis.
The city has vowed to appeal.
“The mayor’s intent is quite clear and he remains undeterred: He wants to return money to the pockets of homeowners,” Mr. de Blasio’s top spokesman, Eric F. Phillips, said in a statement.
In the meantime, water bills will remain as they were, without increases or credits.
