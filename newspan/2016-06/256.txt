A lot of Haley Fohr’s musical life has happened under the name Circuit des Yeux. Since she was a teenager, Ms. Fohr, now 27, has been a kind of one-woman post-cabaret movement, using finger-picked folk-guitar mesmerization, synthesizer ripples, aggressive drone chords and a severe, semi-operatic low voice. She’s hard to contain, and does something that you can’t quite get anywhere else.
Her new record doesn’t bear her real name anywhere; it’s somewhere between EP and LP length, and credited to someone named Jackie Lynn. The cover shows, one assumes, Ms. Fohr as Jackie: She has blond-and-cherry red hair, a red cowboy hat and white Nudie-esque suit, and an industrial dust mask.
The record feels short, which might be a good thing: She leaves you guessing what she’s up to. It is not totally straight-faced — there is some wild humor in “Smile,” a fantasy of revenge against a man who suggests that Jackie could look happier — but neither is it a joke. Ms. Fohr writes a lot of oblique songs and avoids a lot of traditions, but as she’s proven before, she’s better at writing about emotions — burning hopes in particular — than a lot of musicians who deal in them exclusively.
I’m gonna take to the streets, and find strength in all that’s weak.
And like a white city dove, I’ll know skyscraper love.
