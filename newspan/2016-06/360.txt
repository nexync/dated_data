The novelist Neil Gaiman has been fascinated by Norse mythology since he was a boy. When he was about 7, he read Jack Kirby’s comic “The Mighty Thor,” about the hammer-wielding Nordic god. He moved on to Roger Lancelyn Green’s “Myths of the Norsemen,” which he read it over and over until the book fell apart.
So when an editor from W. W. Norton asked if he would be interested in writing a book about Norse mythology, Mr. Gaiman was wildly enthusiastic.
Mr. Gaiman has often drawn on the Norse myths in his own fantasy writing. His hallucinatory fantasy novel “American Gods” features a character based on Odin. In his children’s book “Odd and the Frost Giants,” a young boy encounters a fox, an eagle and a bear who turn out to be Loki, Odin and Thor.
“Those Norse tales have accompanied me through pretty much everything I’ve done,” he said. “They ran like a vein of silver through Sandman, they were the bedrock of American Gods.
