The age of the survey’s 16,000 respondents provided a clue about their optimism. Eighteen percent of those identifying themselves as physical workers were 55 or older, Ms. Collinson said — an indication that many of these older workers had to call it quits before 65, the age at which most said they planned to retire.
Over all, less than 20 percent of physical workers in the United States are 55 or older, the study found, compared with 44 percent of nonphysical workers. Only 6 percent are 65 or older — a much smaller portion than the 24 percent over 65 who hold nonphysical jobs. The median age of people in jobs that the researchers defined as demanding — like farm and factory workers, machine operators and cleaning crews — was 36.
