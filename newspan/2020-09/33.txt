Yoshihide Suga’s status quo cabinet suggested that he was rewarding the factions inside his party that had helped him become prime minister.
On the issue of women in the cabinet, Mr. Suga’s failure to increase their numbers, some analysts said, reflected the fact that there are simply not enough women in the Liberal Democratic Party overall. Ten percent of party lawmakers are women, and Mr. Suga gave ministerial roles to two of them: Yoko Kamikawa, the justice minister, and Seiko Hashimoto, the minister for the Olympics.
The party’s swift promotion of Mr. Suga demonstrated that it was interested not in making sweeping changes to meet the country’s challenges, but instead in broadcasting a sense of continuity amid the global turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic and an increasingly tense geopolitical landscape in the region.
