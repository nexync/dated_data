Politics|Court Approves Warrantless Surveillance Rules While Scolding F.B.I.
The release of a newly declassified ruling follows a separate decision by an appeals court that a defunct National Security Agency program was illegal.
The opinion also cited dozens of other improper queries, including searches for information about Americans that were conducted to vet a potential source; to find information about people who were applying to be police officers; and to find information related to a planned visit by foreign officials.
Still, Judge Boasberg noted that many of those errors occurred before the F.B.I. set up a new system to require analysts to provide a written justification for why their searches met the standards. He said the latest procedures met legal and constitutional requirements.
In the other case, a panel on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the defunct N.S.A. program that collected Americansâ€™ domestic phone call logs in bulk was unconstitutional, echoing a similar ruling in 2015 by the Second Circuit.
