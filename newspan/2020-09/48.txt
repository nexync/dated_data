For people 65 and older, an inactivated vaccine called Fluzone High-Dose is available and covered by Medicare. It is especially recommended for people living in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. It contains four times the level of antigen needed to provoke an immune response than is found in standard-dose flu vaccines. According to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, the high-dose vaccine was 24.2 percent more effective in preventing flu in older adults than the standard-dose vaccine. Another study, published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, found that the use of the high-dose vaccine reduced the risk of respiratory-related hospitalization among nursing home residents.
