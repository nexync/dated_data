Join us on September 24 as The Learning Network and special guests introduce our new Coming of Age in 2020 Multimedia Contest.
Register for the live webinar on September 24 at 4 p.m. Eastern time.
Coming of Age in 2020, our first contest of the school year, acknowledges both the tumultuous events of this year and their outsize impact on young people — and invites teenagers in the United States to respond creatively.
This webinar will not only cover the basics of our related unit, but will also suggest ways to help students brainstorm ideas both big and small, and use mentor texts to help those ideas shine. You will also hear from teachers who are using this contest in their own classrooms — and we’ll save plenty of time for questions and discussion. And, of course, whether students send their work to us or not, documenting our lives right now is valuable far beyond the classroom: Historians, archivists and museums recommend that we all do it, if only for ourselves.
CTLE credit is available for New York educators. All participants will receive a certificate of completion.
