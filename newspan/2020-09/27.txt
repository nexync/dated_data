Chile’s Mapuche have long demanded official recognition of their culture and of their claims to ancestral lands. A referendum over a new Constitution provides them a chance to be included.
Last week, the government announced it had created a committee, led by President Sebastian Piñera, to discuss territorial conflicts and social development in the Araucanía.
The demonstrations, which were set off by an increase in subway fares in October, grew into a broader denunciation of Chile’s entrenched inequality and eventually paved the way for the constitutional reform process that is scheduled to start next month with a plebiscite vote.
Activists are also pressing political leaders to create legislative quotas for Indigenous people, and the Senate is considering setting aside seats for Indigenous people in the constitutional assembly.
