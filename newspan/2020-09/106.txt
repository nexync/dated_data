The decision barring the separatist president of Cataloniaâ€™s regional government, Quim Torra, from holding public office confirms a ruling in December and threatens to reignite unrest.
The Catalan police force had put officers on high alert for possible protests ahead of the decision, which confirmed a December ruling against the separatist leader, Quim Torra, the president of the regional government of Catalonia..
Separatist protesters gathered in Barcelona and other Catalan cities on Monday evening to denounce the ruling. On the Sant Jaume square in Barcelona that is the seat of the Catalan regional government, about 400 demonstrators lit flares and face off with police, who had been put on high alert ahead of the ruling, but no serious incident was reported by local media.
Mr. Torra is the third successive leader of Catalonia to be banned from office. Before Mr. Puigdemont, Artur Mas was also found guilty by a court of violating Spanish law by holding an earlier independence vote in 2014.
