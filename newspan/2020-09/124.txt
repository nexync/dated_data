Colleges and universities have become hot spots for coronavirus transmission. Bring on the gallows humor.
At least eight schools have canceled or temporarily suspended in-person classes because of virus outbreaks, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; the University of Wisconsin, Madison; and Notre Dame. Others seem to be trying to power through the pandemic. The University of Alabama and the University of Georgia have continued to hold in-person classes despite more than a thousand positive cases of coronavirus at each school.
That day, the school's Covid-19 tracker hit 159 cases, provoking feelings of “impending doom,” Mr. Gardner said.
