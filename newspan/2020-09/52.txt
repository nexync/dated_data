The musician quit Dirty Projectors and searched for her own voice and a new musical family. She found them among the collaborators on her latest album of neo-psychedelic rock and in a metal cover band.
Having once quit a high-profile band — the art-pop ensemble Dirty Projectors, in which she was a bassist and vocalist from 2006 until late 2011 — to embark on her own musical journey, Deradoorian seems well-suited to advise on matters of risk and growth. She’s since become a compelling presence in independent music: capable of channeling mystical knowledge into her neo-psychedelic solo records, released under her last name, as well as transforming into Ozzy Osbourne for her role in Black Sabbath Cover Band Rehearsal, an indie-rock tribute act that also features Nick Zinner from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.
In the years since her first solo album, “The Expanding Flower Planet” in 2015, Deradoorian had been largely nomadic and often alone. While the constant movement helped her embrace a more “loose and undefined” approach to songwriting, she has been open about her struggles with finances and self-worth — the realities of life for a working musician.
She also attributed her perseverance to an ongoing dialogue around art within her strong community of musicians — like the drummer Greg Fox and the guitarist Ben Greenberg, whom she collaborated with last year performing Terry Riley’s minimalist classic, “A Rainbow in Curved Air” — and friends such as the drone metal musician Stephen O’Malley.
