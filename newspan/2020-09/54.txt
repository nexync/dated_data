Politics|Nevada Built a Powerful Democratic Machine. Will It Work in a Pandemic?
One example of how things have changed: A Latino outreach group estimated in January that it would register 21,000 new voters in the state by Labor Day. It’s at around 6,000 now.
Its success relied on hundreds of people knocking on thousands of doors for face-to-face conversations with voters. Now, there are fewer than half as many people canvassing for Democratic voters as there were in September 2016. And some Democratic strategists warn that Nevada could be in 2020 what Wisconsin was in 2016 — a state that the Democrats assume is safely in their column but that slips away.
Mr. Biden maintains a slight edge over President Trump in the state, according to new polling from The New York Times and Siena College: four percentage points, within the poll’s margin of error. But Democrats worry about falling short of the kind of enthusiastic turnout they need — particularly among Latinos and working-class voters who make up a significant part of the party’s base here.
A few moderate Republicans will play key roles in the Court battle.
Roughly one-third of all Nevada voters say they plan to vote by mail, and many Democrats fear that ballots will be rejected because of errors, like when a person forgets to sign the outside of the envelope as state law requires. Supporters of Mr. Trump have indicated that they are far more likely to vote in person than supporters of Mr. Biden, according to the Times/Siena poll.
