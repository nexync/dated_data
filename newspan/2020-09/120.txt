The blazes in Brazil, often intentionally set, have scorched a record-setting 10 percent of the Pantanal, one of the most biologically diverse habitats on the planet.
A scientist at Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research, the government agency that tracks deforestation and fires, told Reuters this week that when data is downloaded from the satellites, the agency experts expect to find that this year’s fire season in the Amazon was about as destructive as last year’s, if not more. The preliminary analysis shows more than 13,200 square miles of tree cover in the Amazon burned this year.
