A gospel music prodigy as a child, Mr. Williamson went on to sing with the Motown group for nearly a decade. He died of the coronavirus.
Mr. Williamson died on Sept. 6 at MountainView Hospital in Las Vegas. He was 49. His mother said the cause was complications of the coronavirus after he had contracted pneumonia.
Mr. Williamson had been wowing audiences for 30 years by the time he got his break with the Temptations in 2007. G.C. Cameron, one of the group’s lead singers, left that year to pursue a solo career. According to Mr. Williamson, in an article on the website of the magazine Las Vegas Black Image, he met Ron Tyson, the group’s longtime tenor, who recognized his talent and lobbied for him to become a member.
Mr. Williamson sang on the Temptations albums “Back to Front” and “Still Here” and toured the world with the group.
The Temptations have had many members since they scored hit after hit (“My Girl,” “Ain’t Too Proud To Beg,” “Get Ready,” “Just My Imagination”) in the 1960s and ’70s for Gordy Records, a subsidiary of Motown. But Mr. Williamson stood out.
Mr. Williamson spent his youth singing in the church and performing alongside gospel stars like James Cleveland and Kenneth Glover in concerts that were broadcast on Sundays on KDAY, Los Angeles’s gospel radio station at the time.
After nine years with the Temptations, Mr. Williamson returned to Las Vegas and never lost a step, performing with the Lon Bronson Band, Sons of Soul and other local acts.
He was married and divorced three times. In addition to his mother and brother, he is survived by his sons, Rernishio, Tristian and Bruce III.
“I don’t care about riffs. I don’t care about range too much. I care about actually being able to paint the picture, the portrait, of the song that I’m singing.
