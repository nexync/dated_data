The itinerant hotel developer Jayson Seidman purchased a crumbling, storied house — and had the good sense to leave it mostly alone.
The sunroom looks out on Seidman’s pea gravel patio and tropical yard. Inside are a vintage green swivel chair bought in Texas, a hand-painted wicker couch and chair purchased at auction and rugs that belonged to his grandmother.
In renovating the kitchen, Seidman exposed the ceiling’s original cypress barge boards. A 1950s O’Keefe & Merritt stove, now meticulously restored, anchors a far wall.
A handmade antique broom hangs outside the door to the main bathroom.
Inside the bedroom is a four-poster bed from Room and Board, an angora Oushak carpet and a Continental 19th-century mahogany marble-topped bachelor’s chest purchased at auction, with a photograph of Seidman’s grandmother, taken in the early 1940s, hanging by a floor lamp that was found in the attic.
The facade of the house retains the colors chosen by its previous owner, the antiquarian James Donald Didier.
Didier’s adept use of color is on full display in the stairway at the center of the house. The late-19th-century chandelier was found by Seidman’s mother and sister in Texas, and the prints are from past Ballroom Marfa events that he attended featuring John Waters (2004), Yo La Tengo (2005), Nikolai Haas (2005) and Robert Earl Keen (2008).
In the drawing room, the Danish sofas and bamboo table are midcentury, and a 2018 painting by the Opelika, Ala.-based artist R.C. Hagans sits on the original fireplace mantle, furnished with 19th-century andirons.
The walk-in closet, accessed through the breezeway at the back of the house, with a painting from 1938, a rug Seidman found in Lisbon and two 18th-century chairs.
