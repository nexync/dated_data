A California man was charged with eight counts of attempted murder after he drove his car into several pedestrians at an intersection in Sunnyvale, Calif., on Tuesday evening.
It appeared that the man, identified as Isaiah J. Peoples, 34, intentionally ran into the pedestrians, Chief Phan S. Ngo of the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety said Wednesday.
“Following the collision, a witness reported that Peoples stated something similar to, ‘Thank you, God,’” Chief Ngo added.
The eight victims included three minors. One, a 13-year-old girl, sustained the most serious injuries and was hospitalized in critical condition on Wednesday evening.
Three adults were also hospitalized with serious injuries and were in stable condition. The rest of the victims had been released and it did not appear that Mr. Peoples had been hurt, Chief Ngo said.
He added that Mr. Peoples, who was driving a Toyota Corolla, appeared to have acted alone and that it was unclear what the motive was. “There is no apparent connection between the suspect and the victims,” he said.
Mr. Peoples’s mother, Leevell Peoples, told The Associated Press that the episode might have been related to post-traumatic stress disorder that she said her son had experienced after serving in the Army in Iraq.
It was unclear if Mr. Peoples had a lawyer, and family members could not immediately be reached on Wednesday evening.
The crash occurred at the intersection of El Camino Real and Sunnyvale Avenue, an area surrounded by shopping plazas and restaurants. Mr. Peoples is a resident of Sunnyvale, which is in Northern California, just west of San Jose.
