Although the report presented a grim long-term outlook, it was something of a bright spot that Social Security’s reserves are not depleting more quickly. The program’s disability fund is now not expected to run out until 2052 — 20 years later than what was projected last year.
Government officials said during a news briefing before the release of the report that a strengthening economy and broader access to health care, as a result of the Affordable Care Act, are responsible for declining disability claims.
Democrats played down the need for significant changes to the programs, which they created and have sought to protect. They said cuts to benefits would be unacceptable after waves of tax cuts under President George W. Bush and President Trump.
Mr. Trump was initially resistant to calling for cuts to the programs, but his budget proposal last month did just that. The request, which is being ignored by Congress, proposed shaving $818 billion from projected spending on Medicare over 10 years. It also called for $26 billion less on Social Security programs, including a $10 billion cut to Social Security Disability Insurance, which provides benefits to disabled workers.
Fiscal watchdog groups said on Monday that the new figures underscored the need for changes to the programs.
That appears unlikely in the near term. The weight of Social Security and Medicare on the economy is projected only to grow.
Next year, the combined cost of the programs is projected to be 8.7 percent of the gross domestic product. By 2035, that will jump to 11.6 percent.
