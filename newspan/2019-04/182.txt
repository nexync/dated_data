The police in Northern Ireland blamed the New Irish Republican Army, a militant group, for the killing of the journalist Lyra McKee in Londonderry.
This public order situation saw over 50 petrol bombs thrown at the police, two cars hijacked and set on fire and then unfortunately, at 11:00 last night a gunman appeared and fired a number of shots towards the police. And a young woman, Lyra McKee, 29 years old, was wounded. She was taken away from the scene in a police Land Rover to Altnagelvin hospital, but unfortunately, she has died. Therefore, we have no launched a murder inquiry here in the city. We believe this to be a terrorist act. We believe it’s been carried out by violent Dissident Republicans. Our assessment at this time would be that the new I.R.A. are most likely to be the ones behind this and that forms our primary line of inquiry.
Northern Ireland has not had a functioning government for over two years, since the collapse of a power-sharing agreement between its two main parties — one mostly Protestant, the other mainly Catholic.
Mr. MacDonald also sees a cultural force at work, a perverse nostalgia for the Troubles, particularly among bored urban youths too young to have experienced them. He says that while the shots that killed McKee may have been fired by a republican militant, most of the young men rioting in the streets were most likely unaffiliated, merely participating in what has become, in many run-down areas of Northern Ireland, a sort of folk ritual.
Ms. McKee grew up on Cliftonville Road in Belfast, near the area that saw some of the worst violence during the Troubles. Her work often examined the legacies of that era.
Ms. McKee wrote a book, “Angels With Blue Faces,” about the 1981 murder of the Rev. Robert Bradford, a member of the British Parliament from Belfast.
