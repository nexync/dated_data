In this week’s issue, Vivian Gornick reviews Mary Norris’s book “Greek to Me.” In 1987, Mona Simpson reviewed Gornick’s memoir “Fierce Attachments” for the Book Review.
Every narrator of a memoir is both more and less than a fictional guide. He is only a person, after all, a real person. He may not fully understand himself, and yet he is bound — as if by a promise — to tell us the unshaved truth, however it may or may not conform to his vision. It is this raw covenant that gives memoirs an ability to shock in a way fiction hardly ever can.
Vivian Gornick’s “Fierce Attachments” is just such a document.
Ms. Gornick weaves in, peripherally and profoundly, her long walks with her garrulous, charming, difficult mother through New York City. They walk uptown when one of them wants to attend a lecture, downtown and over the Brooklyn Bridge, on dull winter days, under brilliant skies, for lunch in the park — in other words, they have a life.
What emerges — like a ghost over the water — from these evocations themselves is an altogether different story, as timbered as any plot and with a somber power that has something to do with the fact that this is not a created plot. It is the story of an abiding, difficult love over time, written as both individuals are still alive, but as each prepares for one of them to die.
