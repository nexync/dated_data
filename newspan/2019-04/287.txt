The family of John Singleton, the director, producer, and screenwriter best known for his 1991 film “Boyz N the Hood,” is fighting for control of his business affairs after he suffered a stroke. 
His mother, Shelia Ward, filed papers in court in Los Angeles on Thursday seeking to be named his conservator, or guardian. In the papers, Ms. Ward said her son was in a coma.
The papers say that at the time of the stroke, Mr. Singleton was engaged in several business deals and had been set to sign a lucrative settlement agreement on or around April 30. The documents say that if a conservator cannot sign the papers on his behalf, it will mean a big financial loss.
Ms. Ward requested to be named his conservator for now because her son had not signed any health care directive or power of attorney that would let someone make medical or financial decisions for him, the papers said. As is required in a conservatorship case, the papers included a declaration from a doctor attesting to Mr. Singleton’s impaired state, though the declaration did not specify whether he was in a coma.
“Myself, several of my siblings, and my father’s father will oppose my grandmother’s application to be appointed my father’s legal conservator,” she continued.
It is not the first time his family has feuded publicly — one of his sons wrote an open letter in 2016 accusing Mr. Singleton’s mother of being manipulative and controlling. Mr. Singleton’s lawyer, agent and manager declined to comment on his condition.
A lawyer for his mother did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
