DealBook|The Radio Giant iHeartMedia Prepares for Possible I.P.O.
Is there room for radio in the age of Spotify?
That is the question underlying a securities filing on Wednesday by the broadcast giant iHeartRadio for what it says could be an initial public offering.
The company is pitching potential investors on radio’s reach and intimate appeal in an era of personalized playlists and algorithmic song recommendations.
The largest radio broadcaster in the United States, with 848 terrestrial stations, iHeartMedia remains a force in the music industry, and also syndicates talk-radio giants like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. But the company filed for bankruptcy last year, burdened by $20 billion in debt left over from a leveraged buyout a decade ago, on the eve of the 2008 recession.
In January, the company’s restructuring plan received court approval, cutting the $16 billion of debt attached to its media division — the company’s radio stations, podcasts and iHeartRadio app — to about $5.8 billion. Under the plan, the company would separate iHeartMedia from its billboard advertising business, Clear Channel Outdoor, which would retain about $4 billion in debt.
Now iHeartMedia is considering either an initial public offering of stock or a direct listing. The latter is an uncommon process, used last year by Spotify, that would allow the company to list its shares on the stock market without issuing any new shares. The filing on Wednesday, a spokeswoman said, is a necessary step if the company decides to pursue an I.P.O.
If iHeartMedia does issue new shares through an I.P.O., it plans to use sale proceeds to further pay down its debts, according to the filing.
IHeartMedia estimated that it reaches 275 million listeners per month in the United States. By contrast, Spotify said it had 207 million monthly active users at the end of last year; of those, 30 percent, or about 62 million, were in North America.
IHeartMedia added that it also offered digital broadcasting and 20,000 live events a year, including concerts headlined by the likes of Cardi B and Ed Sheeran.
“Audio is hot for the first time in decades,” Robert W. Pittman, iHeartMedia’s chief executive and a former top executive at MTV and AOL, said in an interview on Tuesday with NBC News.
But as analysts have noted, advertising revenue for radio in the United States has remained largely flat for years, and companies like Pandora (now owned by the satellite radio company SiriusXM) and Spotify have swooped in.
“People still spend over two hours a day listening to radio, and we want to bring that radio listening to Spotify,” Daniel Ek, Spotify’s chief executive, wrote in a blog post in February, when the company announced a $340 million deal for two podcast companies.
IHeartMedia has also pushed into the podcast business. According to the tracking service Podtrac, the company’s iHeartRadio division had an audience of 16.6 million for its podcasts in February, behind only NPR, which had 18.3 million. Ranked by the total number of downloads and streams, iHeartRadio was in the lead, with 148 million.
Last month, iHeartMedia turned one of its AM stations, WSAN in Allentown, Pa., into an all-podcast channel, filling it with programming from Stuff Media, the podcasting studio that iHeartMedia bought in September for a reported $55 million.
