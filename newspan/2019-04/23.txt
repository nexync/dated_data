An article on Tuesday about Tesla’s decision to significantly reduce the prices of its solar panels misstated the national average price for residential solar systems. The average is $2.98 per watt, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, not $2.85. Because of that error, the story also misstated how much Tesla would be slashing prices for its solar systems. The company’s system will cost up to 41 percent less than the national average, not up to 38 percent.
A book review about “Spring” by Ali Smith misstated the location in which Katherine Mansfield and Rainer Maria Rilke lived. It was a Swiss town, not a Swedish town.
A picture caption with an obituary on Tuesday about the singer Jo Sullivan Loesser referred incorrectly to her marriage to the composer Frank Loesser. They were married when he died; they did not divorce.
