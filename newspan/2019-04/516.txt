Senator Bernie Sanders, who faced criticism for not releasing his past tax returns, said he would release 10 years of returns.
A number of Mr. Sanders’s rivals for the Democratic nomination, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, have already released their 2018 tax returns, Ms. Gillibrand has made 12 years of her returns public. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts released 10 years of her returns last year.
Mr. Sanders, a Vermont independent, has repeatedly promised to do the same, but has been evasive about his timing, prompting some speculation that he does not want voters to know what is in them. He has said he and his wife, Jane, who serves as an adviser to his presidential campaign, prepare the returns themselves, without an accountant.
In 2016, they released 2014 returns showing $205,617 in income, including $156,441 in wages and salary and $46,213 from Social Security benefits.
Mr. Sanders — whose trademark on the campaign trail is his attacks on the “millionaires” and the “billionaires” — had consistently ranked among the least wealthy members of the Senate.
But since his 2016 run for the presidency, Mr. Sanders’s financial fortunes have improved. His 2017 Senate financial disclosure forms show he earned roughly $1.06 million that year, more than $885,000 from book royalties. His most recent book, “Where We Go From Here,” was published last year.
