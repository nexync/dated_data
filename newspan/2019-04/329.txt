With plantar fasciitis and other ailments, a key is a realistic therapy routine you can fit into your day.
We often seek treatments that meet our preferences, and bend them around our personal routines and responsibilities.
These truths came to mind as I recently addressed my plantar fasciitis — an injury to the tissue in the underside of the foot causing heel pain and afflicting about 10 percent of the population. I’d unwisely been trying for about six months to ignore the condition in both my feet. I kept walking to work and standing once I got there (by choice — I have a desk job) despite the discomfort.
The log I kept. I didn't want to break my streak.
There are several noninvasive or home-based remedies for plantar fasciitis. Among the most common are orthotics, night splints (which hold your foot flexed to stretch the plantar fascia and Achilles’ tendon) and physical therapy (or at-home stretching/strengthening).
