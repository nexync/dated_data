To use the I.R.S. calculator, you will need a copy of your 2018 return, along with your most recent pay stub (and your spouse’s, if applicable). The calculator can determine how much you need to withhold to end up with the right amount set aside at the end of the year. But it’s already April. If you need to withhold more, the longer you wait, the fewer pay periods there will be to absorb the changes.
Make sure you keep all of that information handy — you will probably have to do this again, and sooner than you would like. The reason? The I.R.S. is updating the W-4 form.
The W-4 has to be overhauled because it was built around personal and dependent exemptions, which the new tax law eliminated.
The tax and payroll industry was critical of the initial proposal released last June. They said it was far too complicated for workers and their employers, and it also asked workers to provide sensitive information — about outside income, among other things — that they might not want to share with an employer. A new draft is expected at the end of May.
After soliciting comments and making more tweaks, the final version should be available by the end of the year, in time for the 2020 tax year.
“Do you want the form to be absolutely accurate or do you want it to be simple and easy to complete?” said Alice Jacobsohn, senior manager of government relations for the American Payroll Association, a group for industry professionals.
When the new form is available, you should probably run through the withholding exercise again. Your employer might ask you to fill out the revised form anyway.
But as you work out how much you want withheld, keep one thing in mind: As good as it feels to get a fat refund, what you’re really doing is giving the government an interest-free loan. So instead of withholding too much, you might direct that extra bit of money into an interest-bearing account, and pay yourself instead.
