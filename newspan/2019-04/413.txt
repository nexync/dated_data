WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court heard arguments on Monday in a curious case in which no one dared say the word at the heart of the dispute, which was the brand name of a line of clothing that had been denied federal trademark protection.
Erik Brunetti, the owner of the clothing line, has sometimes said that its name, FUCT, stood for “Friends U Can’t Trust.” But the justices seemed persuaded that the term amounted to a vulgarity.
Justice Alito added that the First Amendment’s ordinary skepticism of laws that make distinctions based on speakers’ viewpoints may not apply to the word.
The justices seemed equally troubled by the law, which several said was both vague and inconsistently applied, and by the consequences of ruling in Mr. Brunetti’s favor, which some said would encourage the use of swear words and the most charged racial epithets.
The justices seemed to find the provision at issue in Monday’s case more challenging. Mr. Stewart said the government would enforce the challenged provision narrowly in light of the 2017 decision, focusing on terms that are shocking or offensive based on the mode of their expression rather than on the ideas they convey.
Justice Neil M. Gorsuch seemed sympathetic to that approach, though for a different reason. “There are certain words that are profane and that we, as a matter of civility in our culture, would like to see less of rather than more of,” he said.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is 86, said the young people who bought Mr. Brunetti’s wares may not be offended by the brand name. “A composite of, say, 20-year-olds,” she said, would not find the term particularly shocking.
Justices Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh said they were troubled by what Justice Kavanaugh called the “erratic or inconsistent enforcement” of the law, with very similar terms granted protection or not with little seeming rhyme or reason.
