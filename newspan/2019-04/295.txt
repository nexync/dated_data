As a tight labor market raises costs, employers say the need for low-wage help can’t be met by the declining ranks of the native-born.
Note: Projections are based on census data and assume that immigration, legal and illegal, will continue at current rates and that two-thirds of those arriving will be 25 to 64 years old, as is now the case.
Few of these workers studied past high school. Many didn’t get their diploma. Barring immigration, such workers would be hard to find. There are fewer working-age Americans who studied no further than high school than there were 20 years ago, according to an analysis of census data by Ms. Orrenius and Madeline Zavodny of the University of North Florida.
