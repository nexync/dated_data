Only one person was allowed to carry a camera in Oak Ridge, Tenn., during World War II: Ed Westcott. Along with him, the city was home to the enrichment of uranium as part of the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. Mr. Westcott was designated the official photographer of that top-secret city, and he chronicled the lives of the people who lived there and the work they did in helping to give birth to the atomic age.
The core of the legacy left by the Swedish actress Bibi Andersson lies in 13 movies by Ingmar Bergman. While she had a long career on stage and screen, she was most notably part of the informal repertory group that Bergman cast for much of his work. It included Liv Ullman, Max von Sydow, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Ingrid Thulin and Erland Josephson.
Among the films featuring Ms. Andersson were “Smiles of a Summer’s Night” (1955), “The Seventh Seal” (1957), “Wild Strawberries” (1957) and “Scenes From a Marriage” (1974). One of her favorite roles, and the one that established her as a great actress, was in Bergman’s “Persona” (1966). As Anita Gates wrote in her obituary of Ms. Andersson, “She played a sensible nurse with reading glasses and a sunny exterior who reveals herself to be both talkative and troubled,” in contrast to the silent breakdown-suffering actress portrayed by Liv Ullmann.
