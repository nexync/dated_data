Mr. Zarda sued under Title VII and lost the initial rounds. He died in a 2014 skydiving accident, and his estate pursued his case.
The arguments in the Second Circuit had a curious feature: Lawyers for the federal government appeared on both sides. One lawyer, representing the E.E.O.C., said Title VII barred discrimination against gay people. Another, representing the Trump administration, took the contrary view.
Ms. Stephens had worked at the funeral home for six years. Her colleagues testified that she was able and compassionate.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, ruled for Ms. Stephens. Discrimination against transgender people, the court said, was barred by Title VII.
John J. Bursch, a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the funeral home, said the appeals court had impermissibly revised the federal law.
James D. Esseks, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Ms. Stephens and Mr. Zarda’s estate, said the cases concern elementary principles of fairness.
There is a second issue in Ms. Stephens’s case, one that could allow her to win however the Supreme Court might rule on whether Title VII applies to discrimination against transgender people. In 1989, the court said discrimination against workers because they did not conform to gender stereotypes was a form of sex discrimination.
All three cases present the question of how courts should interpret statutes whose drafters might not have contemplated the sweep of the language they wrote.
In January, in a minor arbitration case, Justice Neil M. Gorsuch wrote that courts should ordinarily interpret statutes as they were understood at the time of their enactment. In a concurring opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that was not always so.
