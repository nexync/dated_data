The writer Nora Roberts on Wednesday sued a Brazilian romance novelist for copyright infringement, accusing her of copying or paraphrasing material from 10 of Ms. Roberts’s books.
In the lawsuit, Ms. Roberts, the author of best-sellers such as “The Liar” and “Vision in White,” is asking for damages of at least $25,000 from the novelist, Cristiane Serruya, as well as for sales of her books to be stopped unless all plagiarized material is removed from them. Ms. Roberts said she would donate all of the money to a literacy organization in Brazil.
“I was fooled by some ‘mentors’ and ‘coachers’ who told me that ‘More, more, more, fast, fast, fast,’ ” she wrote, and blamed ghostwriters she had hired on the freelance marketplace Fiverr for the overlap between her books and others.
Ms. Roberts said the material lifted from her books was often word for word.
Two months ago, readers discovered similarities between Ms. Serruya’s novel “Royal Love” and “The Duchess War” by Courtney Milan. Since then, dozens of other novelists — including Tessa Dare, Loretta Chase and Lynne Graham — made similar accusations, some of them sharing their findings on Twitter with the hashtag #CopyPasteCris. More than 40 writers and nearly 100 books are involved so far.
In a series of blog posts in February, Ms. Roberts railed against a “sick, greedy, opportunistic culture” that she said is developing because of Amazon’s Kindle Unlimited, a self-publishing platform in which authors are paid based on how many pages of their books readers read — a system that “incentivizes the fast and more,” she wrote.
An Amazon spokeswoman said the company takes “violations of laws and proprietary rights very seriously,” adding that Ms. Serruya’s books have been removed from the Amazon marketplace.
