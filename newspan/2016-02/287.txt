To put the lives of two artists on film for “The Danish Girl,” the production designer used their art as inspiration.
The Oscar nominees Alicia Vikander and Eddie Redmayne portray the married painters Gerda and Einar Wegener. Einar’s transition to Lili Elbe forms the heart of the film, which was adapted from the novel by David Ebershoff. The soft shades of 1920s Copenhagen, where the couple live and maintain their studio, is seen in their work. And that work is reflected back in the film. The director, Tom Hooper, and his Oscar-nominated production designer, Eve Stewart, aimed to tell the couple’s story sensitively, and designed it with that in mind.
Here Ms. Stewart explains the process involved in creating the film’s look.
To get the contours of this space right, Ms. Stewart said she found out where Gerda and Lili actually lived in Copenhagen and visited the block. From that trip, she came up with a roomy studio with a large source of light. She also sought out paintings and architecture in Denmark and came across the artist Vilhelm Hammershoi (1864-1916), whom she used as a reference.
Late in the film, Lili gets a job in a Copenhagen department store. It is meant to be the setting for one of the happier moments in her life, a time when she was fully accepted by the other women working at the store.
One of Gerda and Lili’s friends was a ballerina. She introduced the couple to the more exotic side of Danish society. To get a sense of her work life , Ms. Stewart visited the Royal Opera House in Paris and went backstage.
Scenes in the studio have a lived-in feel. To get that sense, Ms. Stewart said that she and her team actually painted there.
Initially, the character sketches meant to be made by the film’s artists were done by a few members of the art department.
