WASHINGTON — A judge in California on Tuesday ordered Apple to help the F.B.I. unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the assault in San Bernardino that killed 14 people in December.
The ruling handed the F.B.I. a potentially important victory in its long-running battle with Apple and other Silicon Valley companies over the government’s ability to get access to encrypted data in investigations. Apple has maintained that requiring it to provide the “keys” to its technology would compromise the security of the information of hundreds of millions of users.
Prosecutors said in a court filing that Apple had the “exclusive” means to bypass the security features on the phone, but that the company had “declined to provide that assistance voluntarily.” F.B.I. experts say that because of the phone’s security features, they risk losing the data permanently after 10 failed attempts to enter the password.
Prosecutors said the contents of the phone could provide crucial evidence about the attackers’ communications and contacts before the shooting.
The husband and wife appear to have been motivated by a devotion to violent jihad, but the authorities have not connected them publicly to any extremists overseas. Enrique Marquez, a friend and former neighbor, has been charged with providing them with the assault weapons used in the attack and conspiring with Mr. Farook in an earlier plot that was not carried out.
Prosecutors “have made a solemn commitment to the victims and their families that we will leave no stone unturned as we gather as much information and evidence as possible,” Ms. Decker said.
