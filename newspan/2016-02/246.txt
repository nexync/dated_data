When Ling-Ling and Hsing Hsing Arrived in the U.S.
The foreign guests had traveled a great distance to reach Washington, stopping in Honolulu on the way and finally disembarking under heavy security. On April 16, 1972, they were welcomed to the United States by the country’s first lady, Pat Nixon.
“On behalf of the people of the United States, I am pleased to be here and accept the precious gift of the panda — pandas,” Mrs. Nixon said.
The two pandas Mrs. Nixon greeted were a high-profile symbol of diplomatic rapprochement between the United States and China, brokered under her husband’s administration. When President Richard M. Nixon visited China in February 1972, the government of Mao Zedong announced it would send a pair of the beloved animals to an American zoo. Nixon reciprocated the gift, up to a point, by sending two musk oxen to China.
But dashing the hopes of panda admirers in New York, Mr. Nixon decided that the animals — a female, Ling-Ling, and a male, Hsing Hsing — would live at the National Zoo in Washington.
Upon their arrival in the United States, the pandas were taken to their new home at dawn “under security measures as tight as if they had been Chairman Mao,” The New York Times reported.
A decade and a half later, panda diplomacy of a different kind briefly brought two of the bears to New York. During a 1987 visit to Beijing, Edward I. Koch, then New York’s mayor, lobbied strenuously for a panda loan. “I said I think what the people of New York would love to have is pandas and could we have pandas,” he reported.
Koch said Chinese officials had laughed in response, but they also granted his wish, allowing the Bronx Zoo to host two of the animals for a few months.
Four American zoos, including Washington’s, are home to pandas today. The original pair lived in the National Zoo for decades, until Ling-Ling’s death in 1992 and Hsing Hsing’s death in 1999.
