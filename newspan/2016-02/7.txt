“We wanted to pay homage to the South American influence in Miami’s gastronomic culture,” said chef Grant Achatz, who is currently installed in the newly opened Faena Hotel Miami Beach for a three-week residency. The pop-up series, aptly named “Alinea In Residence,” brings Achatz and a staff of approximately 50 to Miami from Madrid (where the team had recently completed a similar short-term series), to execute an original multicourse menu in the Modernist style of his award-winning Chicago restaurant.
The fifth dish in the 17-course lineup is Alinea’s take on moqueca, a classic Brazilian seafood stew, traditionally made with coconut milk, tomatoes, garlic and herbs. “Alinea’s version plays with the notion of combining the classic flavors of the stew, but creating it within the realm of ceviche by serving the dish cold,” said Achatz.
