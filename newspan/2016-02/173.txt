“Fresenius deeply regrets the confusion and concern temporarily generated by the November 2011 memorandum,” he said in an emailed statement.
Mr. Seeger, who is a founding partner at the New York firm Seeger Weiss, said he disagreed that there was no problem with GranuFlo.
“When you’re paying hundreds of millions, you can say all you want that there’s no admission of wrongdoing or liability, but people draw their own conclusions from that,” he said.
Fresenius said in a news release Wednesday that the settlement would take effect only if 97 percent of all plaintiffs agreed to it by July. It said its insurers would pay $220 million of the amount and Fresenius would take a $60 million pretax charge to cover its share of the settlement and other costs.
