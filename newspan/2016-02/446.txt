The first night of judging at the 140th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show produced winners in four groups Monday at Madison Square Garden. A borzoi named Lucy was first among the hounds; Panda, a Shih Tzu, was named the top toy; Annabelle, a serene bulldog, was selected as the best in the nonsporting group; and Rumor, a German shepherd who was the top dog heading into the show, won the herding group.
Perhaps the most pointed description of one of the winners’ performances came from Kathy Garcia, Panda’s handler.
Jean Hetherington recalled the first time she had seen Annabelle, when she judged her.
