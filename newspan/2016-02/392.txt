The Italian artist Olivo Barbieri is known for his photographs investigating human behavior in relation to the natural majesty of waterfalls and mountain ranges. Now he has turned his attention to the Italian coastline of the Adriatic Sea.
Traversing about 240 miles of coast from Vasto to Ravenna by helicopter, Mr. Barbieri looked down at random groups of people standing in shallow water and saw a kind of serendipitous choreography.
The result — a cross between a Matisse painting and a Busby Berkeley film — is “Adriatic Sea (Staged) Dancing People,” his sixth solo exhibition at the Yancey Richardson Gallery in Chelsea.
