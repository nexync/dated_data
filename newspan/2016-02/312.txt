A New York City police officer was fired on Friday, one day after a jury convicted his partner of manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man in Brooklyn in 2014, the police said.
The officer who was fired, Shaun Landau, 28, had been on modified duty since the shooting, on Nov. 20, 2014, and testified under immunity from prosecution during the trial of his partner, Officer Peter Liang.
The two were conducting a so-called vertical patrol in a stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses, a public housing complex in the East New York section, when a shot from Officer Liang’s gun ricocheted off a wall and struck the unarmed man, Akai Gurley, 28, in the chest, piercing his heart.
Neither of the officers tried to help Mr. Gurley, and they both told a State Supreme Court jury in Brooklyn that they had not felt qualified to perform CPR. The jurors found Officer Liang guilty of manslaughter and official misconduct on Thursday, and he was immediately dismissed by the Police Department.
At the time of the shooting, Officer Landau, like Officer Liang, was still within his two-year probationary period, said Stephen Davis, the chief spokesman for the Police Department.
Michael Cibella, Mr. Landau’s lawyer, said his client was disappointed by the Police Department’s decision, but not surprised. Mr. Landau cannot appeal the decision because he was within his two-year probationary period when the shooting happened, his lawyer said.
To Mr. Cibella, the decision to fire the officers signaled that the Police Department was not taking responsibility for larger problems with how it trained and assigned officers at the time of the shooting.
The fatal shooting of Mr. Gurley has added to a national debate over police use of force against members of minority groups, after a series of episodes in which unarmed black men died at the hands of police officers.
