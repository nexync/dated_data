Kanye West and Taylor Swift just can’t quit each other.
On “Famous,” a button-pushing rap featuring a chorus from Rihanna, Mr. West begins by saying, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.” As if anticipating an outcry, he then asks “Why?” before pushing further and declaring that he made her famous, presumably when he interrupted her acceptance speech for best female video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.
Soon after the song’s premiere, anonymous sources told the gossip website TMZ that Ms. Swift had approved the joke and the song.
A video Ms. Swift’s brother posted to Instagram that showed him throwing his Kanye-designed Yeezy sneakers in the trash indicated otherwise, and about an hour later, a spokeswoman for Ms. Swift denied the report.
Only months ago it seemed the two musicians had come to a general understanding. In an interview with GQ, Ms. Swift said that “to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other — that’s one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.” In August, she even presented Mr. West with a lifetime achievement award at the 2015 edition of the MTV award show where the two initially crossed paths.
