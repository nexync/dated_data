Live musicals on network television might be here to stay.
“Grease: Live!” also got a strong 4.3 rating in the 18-to-49-year-old demographic vital to advertisers, better than “The Wiz,” which was broadcast in December.
The Fox production was energetic, and received mostly warm reviews. The director Thomas Kail, who is also the director of the Broadway hit “Hamilton,” got particularly high marks for making full use of the Warner Bros. lot where the live production was shot. The musical moved effortlessly from different sets and sound stages, occasionally breaking the fourth wall by showing a live audience.
Meanwhile, Fox will move even faster than that. In March, it will broadcast a production of “The Passion,” live from New Orleans. The musical will depict Jesus Christ’s final days, and may be as ambitious as “Grease.” It will include an enormous procession of hundreds of people carrying a cross from the Superdome to a stage near the Mississippi River, and will be hosted by Tyler Perry.
This is also the second straight week that Fox has benefited from a strong Sunday night. Last week, it debuted a revival of “The X-Files” — which followed the N.F.C. Championship — and scored a high rating as well.
