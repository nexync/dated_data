The president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, recently said the bank is considering getting rid of the 500-euro note ($557), though the central bank plans to keep the 200-euro and 100-euro bills. Most Europeans never use the 500-euro note, and some retail stores in the eurozone do not even accept that bill.
Europol, the European Unionâ€™s law enforcement agency, said in a report last year that criminals have been known to trade it for more than 500 euros, a sign of its value to them. Other big bills, like the 1,000 Swiss franc note, which is worth about $1,010, and the 1,000 Singapore dollar bill, the equivalent of $712, are also favored by criminal enterprises and tax evaders.
