Ascia Al Faraj, known online as Ascia AKF, has spent the past four years becoming one of the Middle East’s most influential arbiters of style through her fashion blog, The Hybrids, and her social media flair.
With 1.6 million followers on Instagram alone, Ms. Faraj, 26, who lives in Kuwait, is known for her fabulous accessorizing with designer handbags and bold lipstick colors. As an unpaid ambassador for TAG Heuer, she says the brand is a good fit for her glamorous, multitasking lifestyle.

The Hybrids, which is offline for some upgrades, is a joint project of Ms. Faraj and her husband, Ahmad. The name refers to their mixed ethnicities and nationalities: She is Kuwaiti and American; he, Kuwaiti and Latino. They have a son, Adam, who will turn 2 in April and who has added a practical dimension to her accessorizing.
“Even though the TAG Heuer matches my career, it can also keep up with the pressure of a rough and tumble life of raising a toddler,” she said.
For those who look to her for fashion inspiration, Ms. Faraj champions a gender-generic look that suits the working woman.
