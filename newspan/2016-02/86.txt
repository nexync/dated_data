ALBANY — The State Senate has confirmed the nomination of Michael J. Garcia, a former United States attorney, to the remaining vacancy on the New York Court of Appeals.
Mr. Garcia, most recently a partner at a New York City law firm, was the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2005 to 2008. He was nominated by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, but has promised senators that he would be independent.
Mr. Garcia is a Republican whose office’s investigation into a prostitution ring led to the 2008 resignation of former Gov. Eliot Spitzer. He was among seven possible nominees for the Court of Appeals who were advanced by a state commission that found all of them to be well qualified.
He replaces Judge Susan Read, who retired. A Republican, she was appointed to the seven-member court by Gov. George E. Pataki.
