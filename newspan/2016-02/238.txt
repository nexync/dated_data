Though she presents her line during Kiev’s fashion week, where she was first invited to show by Mercedes-Benz in 2014, Senchina has emerged as a young designer to watch on Milan’s women’s wear scene. Her last collection, a ’70s pop-inspired mash-up of glitz and cowboy fringe, entitled “Panic in Vegas,” garnered considerable attention.
For coffee at the Casa Galimberti, Senchina wears scarlet lipstick and a long black braid pulled high on her head, along with a slim, zip-neck ski sweater from her latest collection — the first to feature knitwear — and an oversized midnight-blue wool coat with bands of contrasting colors running up the sleeves. The coat comes from an outerwear-only collection she created as a student at one of Milan’s fashion schools, the Istituto Marangoni, which earned her the campus moniker of the donna cappotto — coat woman. Having moved to Milan at 22, Senchina admits that she has, in her words, cried frustrated tears over adjusting to a new country, culture and language. But now, with a growing customer-base and an agile use of Italian, she finds herself at home here.
