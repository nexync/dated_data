Jordan Roschwalb was explaining how technology, the Internet, social media — all of it — have been conspiring against opportunities for genuine connection. His answer: pins.
In the last year, enamel pins, those old standbys of kids and collectors, have found new favor on Instagram and in the fashion world. Oodles of small companies have emerged selling designs — some grounded in pop culture, and others in original art — for around $10, making for a low-cost, high-impact accessory.
Mr. Roschwalb’s company, Pintrill, one of the dominant brands in the pin resurgence, began two years ago with an emphasis on pop culture themes, and also emoji, “the hieroglyphics of our time.” It’s also a frequent collaborator with fashion companies and tastemakers. “I’m trying to be the Nike of pin brands,” said Mr. Roschwalb, who estimated that Pintrill has released about 200 designs.
Morgan Watt of Inner Decay cites the ease of bringing a new style to market (he said he can go from sketched idea to full production run in about two weeks) as part of the reason for the pin surge. Also, for the last couple of years, high-minded streetwear companies like Stampd, Kith, Palace and Supreme have released new pins each year.
A community has coalesced on Instagram, where small companies showcase their wares and enthusiast accounts like @pincommunity, @pinoftheday and @pin_lord each have more than 15,000 followers. Jessie Hinojosa, who runs @pincommunity, estimates that there are about 600 small pinmakers currently working. Often they release products in limited-edition batches that sell out quickly.
