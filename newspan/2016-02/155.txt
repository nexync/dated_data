HONG KONG — As the Chinese economy stumbles, wealthy families are increasingly trying to move large sums of money out of the country, worried that the value of the currency will fall and their savings will be worth less.
To get around the country’s cash controls, individuals are asking friends or family members to carry or transfer out $50,000 apiece, the annual legal limit in China. A group of 100 people can move $5 million overseas.
The practice is called Smurfing, named after the blue, mushroom-dwelling cartoon characters, and it is part of an exodus of capital that is casting doubt on China’s economic prospects and shaking global markets. Over the last year, companies and individuals have moved nearly $1 trillion from China.
Some methods are perfectly legal, like investing in real estate elsewhere, buying businesses overseas and paying off debts owed in dollars. Others, like Smurfing, are more dubious, and in certain cases, outright illegal. Chinese customs officials caught a woman last year trying to leave the mainland with $250,000 strapped to her chest and thighs and hidden inside her shoes.
If the government cannot keep citizens from rushing to the financial exits, China’s outlook could darken. The swell of outflows is a destabilizing force in China’s slowing economy, threatening to undermine confidence and hurt a banking system that is struggling to deal with a decade-long lending binge.
The capital flight is already putting significant pressure on the country’s currency, the renminbi. The government is trying to prevent a free fall in the currency by stepping into the markets and tapping its huge cash hoard to shore up the renminbi. But a deep erosion of those reserves may set off further outflows and create turbulence in the markets.
As the economy stumbles, individuals and companies are pulling money out of China en masse, leaving the government scrambling to limit the outflows.
China is also trying to put the brakes on outflows, by tightening its grip on the country’s links to the global financial system. The government, for example, just started to clamp down on people’s use of bank cards to buy overseas life insurance policies.
Such moves have trade-offs. The limits create concerns that the government is pulling back on reform efforts that China needs to keep growth humming in the decades to come. But the near-term pressure also requires serious attention, given the global shock waves.
“The currency has become a very near-term threat to financial stability,” said Charlene Chu, an economist at Autonomous Research.
Navigating such problems is fairly new for China.
For years, China soaked up much of the world’s investment money, as the economy grew at annual rates in the double digits. A largely closed financial system kept China’s own money corralled inside the country.
Now, with growth slowing, money is gushing out of the country. And the government has a looser grip on the spigot, because China dismantled some currency restrictions to open up its economy in recent years.
Managing the situation has proved complicated for the government.
China abruptly devalued the renminbi by 4 percent last August, as part of a shift to a more market-oriented approach and to help exporters. But that surprise move set off sharp stock falls.
The government then tried to guide the currency down in quieter fashion, with the renminbi falling 2.8 percent over a five-week period ending in early January. Even so, the stealthy move led to a sell-off, as global investors fretted about the Chinese economy.
The Chinese central bank is fighting the downward pressure by purchasing large sums of renminbi, selling dollars from its currency reserves to do so. China’s reserves sank by $108 billion in December and an additional $99 billion in January, to $3.23 trillion. A year and a half ago, they stood at $4 trillion.
And the renminbi still faces plenty of headwinds.
The government has been cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy, making it less attractive for savers to keep their money in the country. Corporate profits are shrinking because China has too many spare steel mills, car factories and empty houses, leading investors to seek better returns elsewhere.
In this environment, many banks and economists expect another sharp devaluation this spring. But the Chinese government has denounced predictions of any further erosion of the renminbi. The People’s Daily, the state-owned newspaper, in late January criticized George Soros, the billionaire trader known for big currency bets, after he questioned Chinese policies.
“When they came out to attack Soros, to me that was the strongest signal that they will do whatever they can not to make Soros and other hedge fund managers too rich,” said Weijian Shan, chief executive of PAG, a private equity firm based in Hong Kong that manages $15 billion.
The government’s next move, in part, will depend on whether it can stem the outflows, or at least slow them significantly. And in China, it is a bit of a cat-and-mouse game.
After the sudden closure of a shoe factory, a migrant worker on China’s eastern seaboard heads back to his home in the countryside. China’s shoe industry has been hit hard by the slowing economy.
Overall: like the open and structure - good music - I would tighten, esp open (I made suggestions below) and try to get to the gentleman on the train sooner. Also made a few narration tweaks. TRANSCRIPT 39 00:15:42-00:15:45 Maybe there are factories closing down every minute. Is this verbatim translation - can we drop the “maybe“? 00:15:46-00:15:53 If they don’t have orders and they need to feed workers and pay wages — the costs are unbearable. TITLE: Victims of a Slowing Economy - - feels like we should be able to have a shoe metaphor in the title here ... agreed! At its peak, 1 out of every 4 sneakers in the world came from this neighborhood in Dongguan, China. But today, the streets seem close to abandoned, with only traces of the former boom left behind. MOVE TRANSCRIPT 28 00:08:50-00:08:54 Many factories moved to Bangladesh and Vietnam because human cost is low there. TRANSCRIPT 39 00:04:17-00:04:22 In 2007 and 2008, Salaries used to be just more than 1000 RMB per month. 00:04:22-00:04:25 Human cost was very low. 00:04:27-00:04:31 Now, it’s at least 3000 RMB/month. TRANSCRIPT 39 00:06:44-00:06:53 Now there are too many people because the big factories moved. There’s only small factories left and they need fewer workers, right? There’s a surplus of labor here. TRANSCRIPT 4 00:01:49-00:01:52 Mr. Tao: Our factory used to make shoes. 00:03:57-00:03:59 Mr. Tao: 293 workers in total just lost their jobs. 00:02:10-00:02:22 Mr. Tao: We don’t know how the financial chain broke, but they and haven’t give us wages for June, July and August. These laid-off workers have gathered outside of their old factory to discuss how to get their back wages paid. China’s shoe exports are in decline and for the millions of migrant workers who came here to earn a living, the slowing economy has begun to uproot their lives. TRANSCRIPT 4 00:08:08-00:08:14 Mr. Tao: At our age, you have already invested your time into this industry, it’s very difficult to switch to another industry. 00:08:15-00:08:18 Mr. Tao: We don’t have the technical skills to do other jobs. But For some, the factory closure might be the end of their urban dream. TRANSCRIPT 4 If our attempts to get our money back keep going nowhere, we really won’t be able to handle this crisis. And we will lose our confidence towards the government and other departments 00:20:42-00:20:50 Red woman: If we worked for 3 months and get nothing, then why would we come out and work? We can go back home and farm, which gives us stable income. — IN TRAIN - - 090 00:05:11-00:05:17 A man should have ambitions beyond his hometown. You’ve got to explore the world, right? 00:05:29-00:05:33 I didn’t have some big dream. My dream was to just make some money. Liu Lang came to Guangdong from Sichuan Province 20-years ago. 090 00:04:22-00:04:28 At that time, my family was very poor. We lived in the mountains 00:04:29-00:04:35 and we had trouble feeding ourselves. 00:04:35-00:04:37 Both food and shelter were a problem. 00:04:39-00:04:43 So I went out to work. music in - - > Modern China was built on the backs of workers like Mr. Liu. There’s almost as many migrant workers in China as there are people in the United States. Over 260 million have left their homes in the countryside to find work in city. And the fading shoe industry isn’t alone. Sector after sector has Other manufacturing sectors have failed to compete with cheaper business models in South and Southeast Asia. And with less work and less fewer jobs, an increasing amount of more migrant workers have started to question if the city is still the right place for them. 090 00:07:11-00:07:14 I worked my way up from a basic worker to a department head. 00:07:15-00:07:20 And my career basically ended today. 093 00:03:49-00:03:58 My wife and I were both working at that factory. We lost more than 20,000 RMB for the last three months. 00:03:58-00:04:03 20k is almost one person’s half-year income. The government has plans to transform China’s economy by moving focus to high tech and green industries. But their plan largely leaves out uneducated migrant workers who are too young to retire, but too old for entry level factory jobs. And with so many people like Mr. Liu, the slowing economy could be the start of a reverse migration pattern. for those who are unwilling to take entry-level factory jobs like those they had 20 or 30 years ago. 092 00:01:13-00:01:16 So now I’m taking the train home. 00:01:33-00:01:44 The factory closed down, so I’m taking this chance to go home because we haven’t spent much time with our families the entire time we’ve been working away from the village. 00:01:44-00:01:53 So I’ll take this chance to go back and be with my children. 231 00:03:34-00:03:38 Actually, I’ve spent more time with my boss than with my parents. For now, Mr. Liu is the exception, not the norm. Most migrant workers who lose their factory jobs will move on to another factory, although they might not get the wage they want. And as for these workers getting their back wages paid, China’s turbulent economy will likely hold on to that. TRANSCRIPT 28 00:03:22-00:03:32 Mr. Tao: Old Tao, factories are closing down! It’s not just here in Shao’an. It’s also the textile industry. Thousands of workers, they are also asking for wages, it’s the same thing. Other woman: Many people are asking for it. TRANSCRIPT 39 00:08:25-00:08:27 There’s no hope. 00:08:28-00:08:35 I definitely want it back, that’s our hard-earned money and we worked very hard and overtime for it. Who doesn’t want it back? 00:08:35-00:08:45 But the boss ran away, the machines, equipment and materials in the factory aren’t worth much money. 00:08:45-00:08:47 The company has lots of debt. ENDIT ONCE USED, BUT NOW UNUSED QUOTES 233 00:06:20-00:06:27 The shoe industry has largely moved to Southeast Asia. 00:06:27-00:06:39 Here, the costs seem to be too high. Companies that have low profits and basically cannot survive. 00:06:39-00:06:53 Many of our friends went to Vietnam or Cambodia or were hired to work there. 00:06:53-00:07:05 So for people like us ... those places (in Southeast Asia) have just started to develop, it’s possible to go find jobs there. 00:06:55-00:07:03 Many people who came here from the farms and working families, it’s difficult for them to find jobs. 00:07:03-00:07:08 Even if they find jobs, the factories and salaries are not so stable. 00:07:08-00:07:12 Factories can close down anytime. TRANSCRIPT 4 00:20:17-00:20:23 Red woman: If this thing keeps going nowhere, we really can’t take the crisis. 00:20:23-00:20:27 Ms Wu: And we will lose our confidence towards the government and other departments. 090 00:06:46-00:06:53 At first I was making the soles of shoes. 00:06:53-00:06:59 And then I learned some techniques and slowly moved up to management. 090 00:10:07-00:10:12 At first, some departments in the factory didn’t have work to do. 00:10:12-00:10:18 The boss’s initial plan was to let some people take vacation. 090 00:10:46-00:10:52 But as time went by, there was no salary. 00:10:52-00:11:01 So those who were still working stopped working because they didn’t get any wages. 231 00:04:11-00:04:23 Suddenly it was just gone. I feel like I don’t have any sense of accomplishment.
Individuals can move $50,000 a year across China’s borders. Companies and sophisticated investors have more freedom to send out money legally for big-ticket purchases and investments. Overseas and domestic companies, which maintain bank accounts in various currencies, can also shift their cash, as well as borrow based on which currency they think will fall in value.
But unofficial methods abound.
Companies have filed misleading invoices to keep more profits outside the country, although Chinese authorities have cracked down on the practice.
Mr. Rein described doing market research with a wealthy woman in Shanghai who changed $7 million this winter from renminbi into dollars, by using 140 relatives, friends and even friends’ relatives who each carried $50,000 apiece.
The government, though, is trying to cut off some routes.
Two years ago, the government gave permission for insurers to invest 15 percent of their assets overseas, up from 1.5 percent. But China abruptly told insurers this winter to suspend many of their overseas plans, according to Hong Kong financiers.
Beijing has restricted the withdrawal of renminbi from overseas branches of Chinese banks. In Shenzhen, banks have begun requiring that residents make reservations up to a week in advance if they want to change the daily maximum of $10,000 worth of Chinese currency into dollars.
In January, Zou Tai, a hospital worker from east central China, caught an early morning flight to buy a $50,000 life insurance policy in Hong Kong. Scores of Chinese customers have been doing the same to get money out of the country, since the policy is bought in renminbi and can be cashed out in American dollars.
Mrs. Zou acted in the nick of time, because the government is now pushing back. UnionPay International, a government-controlled bank card company, recently announced that it would start strictly enforcing a pre-existing but widely ignored limit on overseas insurance purchases of $5,000 a year per card.
