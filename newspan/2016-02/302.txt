The Times editorial board is right that the Zika virus creates “anxiety” for women in Latin American countries (“Fighting the Zika Virus on Multiple Fronts,” Feb. 3). But women’s reproductive health care in Latin America isn’t a crisis today just because of the virus; it has been an ongoing crisis.
Lawmakers who have bent their knees to evangelicals and Catholic bishops lobbying to make abortion laws more restrictive have shown disgraceful hypocrisy. Women in Latin America with healthy pocketbooks can circumvent any restriction on abortion or contraception. It’s only the poor and marginalized, and those who live in rural areas, who suffer.
Reports that lawmakers may be re-examining their conscience and the law indicate that there might be hope (“Zika Reignites Battle in Brazil Over Abortion,” front page, Feb. 4).
When the pope visits Mexico in the coming weeks, we pray that he will speak to the real change that women in Latin America desperately need. And that politicians will do the right thing.
