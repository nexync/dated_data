Dennis Cheatham said he felt as if he were receiving a message from the past last May when a package arrived in the mail from Nielsen asking him to participate in the survey that for decades has detailed the television viewing habits of Americans.
He was eager to take part, but quickly ran into a problem. Mr. Cheatham’s family canceled its satellite subscription about five years ago, and the roughly 20-page timetable diary Nielsen provided for him to record his family’s viewing made no room to log the hours he, his wife and two children spent streaming shows on digital outlets like Netflix.
Mr. Cheatham is not the only one asking that question.
Nielsen, the 93-year-old company that has long operated an effective monopoly over television ratings in the United States, is facing blistering criticism from TV and advertising executives who see it as a relic of television’s rabbit-ears past as the digital revolution transforms how people consume entertainment. New competition — notably the $768 million merger this week of the media measurement companies comScore and Rentrak — is forcing Nielsen to evolve.
One of the latest public criticisms was made last month, when Linda Yaccarino, the ad sales chief at NBCUniversal, complained that Nielsen was failing to accurately measure TV and account for all of the television group’s audiences. “Imagine you’re a quarterback, and every time you threw a touchdown, it was only worth four points instead of six,” she said at the International CES trade show.
The stakes are high. Some $70 billion in advertising dollars are traded in the United States each year based on Nielsen’s ratings, and hundreds of television programs live or die based on that viewership data.

Chief among the complaints about Nielsen is that viewers across the country like Mr. Cheatham and his family are streaming billions of hours of video on outlets like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, but that their behavior is not being captured in industry ratings based on Nielsen data.
“The TV ratings system as we know it is outdated,” said Tim Nollen, a Macquarie analyst.
Nielsen executives promise that they are paying attention and are ready and able to track the myriad ways people consume media. They also underscore that paper diaries are deployed to measure viewing in local television markets, which account for a small part of the business, and that panels with more sophisticated electronic meters measure national viewing.
For a long time, the only real recourse television and ad executives had was to grumble. They still relied on and paid for Nielsen measurement because it was their main option.
Now, new rivals seeking to challenge Nielsen’s dominance have emerged. The latest came on Monday, when comScore and Rentrak announced they were united after the closing of their merger. ComScore, founded in 1999, has expertise in measuring the use of digital media, while Rentrak uses data from set-top boxes to measure what people watch on television. Combined, the companies are seeking to measure audiences across screens — mobile, desktop, television and more.
Whether any of the new players will dethrone Nielsen is unclear. Some industry analysts like Mr. Nollen and other executives said that because of its legacy, Nielsen remained best positioned to provide a single source of ratings data across TV and digital. Others question whether ratings will even be relevant in a not-too-distant digital future, when ads are bought and sold based on specific data about viewers, such as location, occupation, salary and purchases, rather than broad audience metrics.
In the last year, Nielsen has released 69 new products and technology innovations — most notably introducing a measurement called total audience metric to track TV viewing across video on demand, mobile and streaming.
Yet Nielsen is established on an inherent conflict that can impede the adoption of new measurement methods. Nielsen is paid hundreds of millions of dollars a year by the television industry that it measures. And that industry, which uses Nielsen’s ratings to sell ads, is known to oppose changes that do not favor it. “People want us to innovate as long as the innovation is to their advantage,” Mr. Hasker said.
Some television and advertising executives have said that Nielsen has started to address their concerns. CBS, for instance, announced in September that it was working with Nielsen to measure viewers across streaming and mobile.
Still, others complain that Nielsen is not moving quickly enough. Nielsen executives said the new ratings would be ready for this spring’s industry bazaar known as the upfronts, when advertisers commit tens of billions of dollars for the coming television season. But media and ad executives said that was highly unlikely. Nielsen has made the total audience metric data available to networks for a preview period but is not permitted to publicly release data about the viewership for particular shows and networks until it agrees with clients on terms.
Another major initiative from Nielsen was the expansion of its national television ratings panel, which deploys electronic devices to track minute-by-minute viewing. To capture more diverse and splintering audiences, the company increased its panel to nearly 41,000 households, or about 100,000 people, from 21,000 households. Again, some executives said that the change came too late. When it is possible to track the websites people visit, what products they buy and which shows they stream, advertisers say they are seeking much more detailed information.
Mr. Hasker said that Nielsen was exploring ways to incorporate more digital data, like Facebook registration information and direct feeds from set-top boxes, into its ratings.
The battle between the old and the new measurement establishment already is playing out across the local television market, which is measured separately from the national market. For years, Nielsen deployed its paper diaries to measure viewing. Rentrak entered the market and won a number of clients by offering an alternative: using the data from set-top boxes to measure what people are watching on the television. After closing its deal with comScore, the new company is expected to include more complete and accurate digital viewing data by merging Rentrak’s television metrics with comScore’s digital data. But even that new method is not perfect. Some critics point to holes in Rentrak data, stating that set-top box measurement does not represent the total population.
“We have heard from our clients across the industry, and the message has been very clear: Measurement needs to evolve,” Serge Matta, comScore’s chief, said Monday in announcing the closing of the merger.
