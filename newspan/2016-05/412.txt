There’s a sly urgency in Jack DeJohnette’s backbeat, which combines a strong forward pull with something cagey and equivocal. That rhythmic signature is crucial to the feel of some Miles Davis albums from the early 1970s and a range of other music since. The latest example is “In Movement,” the debut ECM release by an exploratory trio with Mr. DeJohnette on drums and piano, Ravi Coltrane on saxophones and Matthew Garrison on electronics and bass guitar.
The album opens with “Alabama,” John Coltrane’s mournful hymn, and later hits peak intensity with “Rashied,” a tribute to his last drummer, Rashied Ali. (A roiling, spontaneous duo for drums and sopranino saxophone, that track feels revelatory and ablaze.) There are slow, pensive offerings like “Blue in Green,” from a Miles Davis album on which John Coltrane appeared.
A much more delicate version of “Lydia,” which is the name of Mr. DeJohnette’s wife, appears on his first solo piano album, “Return.” Just out on Newvelle — a vinyl-only subscription label whose aesthetic, in terms of visual as well as sonic design, suggests a debt to ECM — it’s an album of careful contemplation and obvious personal stake.
The piano goes even farther back than the drums for Mr. DeJohnette, whose style on “Return” is austere but sonorous, with viscosity in his touch and use of pedal sustain. Beyond Milton Nascimento’s “Ponte De Areia,” delivered as a twinkling lullaby, every track is an original, with some shades of influence: “Ode to Satie” broadcasts its allusions, while “Silver Hollow” has a stately melancholy that evokes Keith Jarrett, a longtime associate.
But when Mr. DeJohnette digs into a groove, as on “The Dervish Trance” or “Exotic Isles,” he finds a meditative space of his own. At no point does he sound like a drummer merely dabbling in melody and harmony — and yet his command of rhythm is as profound and inexplicable in this format as in any other.
