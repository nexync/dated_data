About 20 years ago we were in Coney Island to visit the aquarium and, of course, Nathan’s for their world-famous hot dogs. An old man, 80ish, was in front of me on line. He ordered a hot dog, “just one, please,” in the polite manner of a supplicant before the altar, and offered his coins in payment. The very young woman waiting on him was a tad impatient; the place was busy, the old man hesitant.
She scooped up the change and said, with a sharpness meant to intimidate, “Hey, old man, this ain’t real money.” She slid back three nickels. The old man was flustered, embarrassed, confused. The counter lady didn’t hand over the hot dog, and the old man didn’t have any other money.
I was close enough to see and hear what was going on, and asked the old man if I could help. He looked at me imploringly, and I was happy to exchange his three well-worn old buffalo nickels for three shiny new Jeffersons.
Nathan’s Famous of Coney Island celebrates its 100th anniversary on Saturday with 5-cent hot dogs, the price of 100 years ago. Maybe I’ll use those three buffalo nickels for three hot dogs. I might have to explain them to the counter lady, though.
