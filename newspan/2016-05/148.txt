My college boyfriend was known for a time in his hometown as the high school valedictorian who missed graduation: He was sailing the Newport Bermuda race on his father’s boat when the wind died. At least, as the father of the narrator in Jim Lynch’s new novel would say, the kid had his priorities straight.
Josh’s little sister, Ruby, in her youth a skipper so preternaturally gifted it seemed she was touched by Poseidon, Odin, Njord and all of the other water and wind gods their grandfather propitiates, exited dramatically from competitive sailing a decade ago and hasn’t been back on the water since. (Josh’s brother, on the other hand, has become a “citizen of the sea,” of dubious legality.) Anyone who has spent an afternoon as railmeat will recognize the classic ­helmsman/tyrant in Bobo Jr., who during the downwind leg of a light-air race gets so infuriated by a crew member that he orders him off the boat — as in, forces him to jump overboard.
This is an incredibly robust evocation of the sailing world of Puget Sound. That, and the memorable portrait of Ruby Johannssen, carried me through the final pages of the novel, in which several plot lines are somewhat hastily wrapped up. Unlike his namesake, Joshua Slocum Johannssen doesn’t circumnavigate the globe, but in this lovably obsessive work, Lynch’s microcosm will do just as well.
