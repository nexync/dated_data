It would be easy for a hotel as iconic as Le Sirenuse, nestled into a rocky hillside in Positano, on Italy’s Amalfi Coast, to rest on its laurels. Converted from a private home in 1951, it retains an unusually intimate charm and appears blissfully untouched by time. But Antonio Sersale, the son of one of the hotel’s four sibling-founders, who now oversees its operations, is a man of boundless energy and diversified interests. At the beginning of every season for the past 10 years, he has hosted, with the novelist Dani Shapiro, a weeklong writer’s conference, offering workshops taught by the likes of Susan Orlean and Meg Wolitzer. And with the art adviser Silka Rittson-Thomas, he has recently begun to commission works of art: Each year, an artist is invited to spend time at the hotel and then create a piece for the property — a neon sign by the Turner Prize-winner Martin Creed was recently installed in the hotel’s lounge.
Meanwhile, the line of airy and colorful printed caftans and silk dresses designed by Sersale’s wife, Carla, and sold among Carlo Moretti glassware and embroidered cushions at the hotel’s boutique, will now be available stateside at Bergdorf Goodman. Carla has expanded into men’s wear, too, opening another shop on the premises to carry a line of knitwear, chinos and linen separates, designed in collaboration with Luca Larenza, plus swim trunks by Allegra Hicks. As if there wasn’t reason enough to check into one of the most sublime hotels in the world.
