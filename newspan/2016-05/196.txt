The big news of the theater world this week will be the list of Tony Award nominees, set to be announced at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday.
But even before the nominators speak, the market is expressing its views on the season, now that all of the new shows have opened.
Overall, the week ending May 1 was a strong one for Broadway, because it was a vacation week for New York City public schools. The 37 plays and musicals now running grossed $28 million, up $1.2 million from the week before, according to figures released Monday by the Broadway League. The current Broadway season is now grossing 0.7 percent more than last season, and attendance is up 1.6 percent.
The grosses for several shows were affected by free tickets given to journalists, Tony voters and opening-night guests.
Among the latest openings, “Waitress” is looking especially strong; it grossed $907,936 in eight performances last week and played to sold-out houses all week. And Cirque du Soleil’s Broadway debut, “Paramour,” continues to do very well in previews, earning $1,065,771 in six performances last week; that show is scheduled to open on May 25, making it the first show of the 2016-17 theater season.
