The reality star and transgender activist Caitlyn Jenner, who has been denounced for her politics by the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community, visited a high school in Brooklyn with Nicholas Kristof to meet some of her critics.
Caitlyn Jenner, she’s not like a woman of history who has done anything to benefit anyone. Everyone is patting her on the back like many people have not been transgender before As time progressed i realized that she isn’t really doing much. So what is the point. (Spencer:) She’s privileged and she doesn’t sue her privilege to advocate for those who can’t speak for themselves. (Michelle:) Do you think she deserved the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPY’s? (All Voices:) No (Michelle:) Raise your hand, did she deserve woman of the year for glamour? ****THESE STUDENTS GO TO THE ACADEMY FOR YOUNG WRITERS IN BROOKLYN, NEW YORK.   ] SPENCER WAS CONSIDERED A GIRL AT BIRTH BUT NOW IDENTIFIES AS MALE. WHEN I MET HIM LAST YEAR, HE REGARDED JENNER AS AN INSPIRATION. (SPENCER) I don’t hear about no charity work, no donations I don’t even hear about trans youth matters, none of that.  SO WHAT HAPPENED? (friend from from I am Cait) They don’t like us (Jenner from I am cait) They’re not my people if they’re against this issue so big deal, I am not cheering them on. (Friend) You are, you’re voting for Ted Cruz, you’re cheering him on. ***IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR THAT ALTHOUGH HER GENDER CHANGED, JENNER’S CONSERVATIVE VIEWS DIDN’T... ...NOR DID HER BINARY VIEWS ON GENDER...  (JENNER FROM ELLEN) ****...ALTHOUGH SHE NOW SAYS THAT HER VIEWS HAVE PROGRESSED AND SHE FULLY SUPPORTS IT. JENNER WAS IN TOWN RECENTLY AND HAVING READ MY COLUMN ABOUT THIS SCHOOL, SHE WANTED TO VISIT IT. I HOPE IT GOES WELL. (KRISTOF) So the student’s don’t know you’re coming (JENNER) Oh good I love surprises I HOPE IT GOES WELL. (JENNER WALKS IN) well hi, how are you doing? What do we have here? (KRISTOF) Spencer and Joshua (JENNER) Caitlyn nice to meet you//....I was a white male privileged - Okay. So yeah, I’ve gotten very criticized for that, okay, within the trans community. What do I know, well actually I know a lot, I will never ever make excuses for working hard all my life and being successful and raising a wonderful family of kids.//So many - take trans kids - trans people, can transition in private. I have not had that luxury. Because of who I am, and quote, that privilege. Ah, I have been exposed to more than you could ever even imagine. Being destroyed in the tabloids to papparazzi following me everywhere, lies about me, stuff. ***JOSHUA IDENTIFIES AS MALE, BUT SOMETIMES LIKES TO DRESS UP AS A GIRL. (JOSHUA) I had a question.” ... “Okay so in the GSA there was a question about the Arthur Ashe award. And many argued that you shouldn’t have received the award...I did, did you think that you should have received the award? (JENNER) Well, I was very honored. (JENNER SPEECH) All across this country, right now, all across the world, at this very moment, there are young people coming to terms with being transgender. They’re learning that they are different and they are trying to figure out how to handle that, on top of every other problem that a teenager has. They’re getting bullied, they’re getting beaten up, they’re getting murdered and they’re committing suicide. (JENNER) the Arthur Ashe Award gave me that. Gave me that opportunity. And so I’m very very happy. Ah, was I worthy of it?  Next year there’ll e a new person, you know.”  (JOSHUA) I never wanted to go outside. Um, never. I was scared that I would get bullied. I was scared that they would talk about me. // But once I came into the school and then the conversation in June, when the Vanity Fair came out. [laughter] Um, it basically opened up everybody’s ideas and now the school even became more accepting SPENCER’S QUICK ACCEPTANCE OF JENNER WAS A BIT SURPRISING. Q: So Spencer, your world is completely different from that of Caitlyn Jenner’s, you know, here is a wealthy white older woman, who’s got ah, you know, more money than anybody and her big problem is being chased by paparazzi. Your problem is being chased by kids that might want to beat you up. S: Yeah. It is a big gap, but//by using her story, her voice to advocate she’s opening the door for people who are like me. We don’t have to wait another 45 years to come out, we can do it now.”  BEFORE SHE LEFT, WE LIVE STREAMED PART OF OUR CONVERSATION IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL’S GENDER NEUTRAL BATHROOM.... “Nat pop at the bathroom...” A LOT OF THE COMMENTS WERE PRETTY TOUGH TO READ. ... ITS CLEAR WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO...AND WHILE AMERICA DEBATES BATHROOM POLICIES, A CRISIS CONTINUES, NEARLY HALF OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE WILL ATTEMPT SUICIDE. BUT AT LEAST WE’RE TALKING...
When Caitlyn Jenner was first emerging from the shell of gold medalist Bruce Jenner, Americans were riveted, voyeuristic — and surprisingly accepting.
So much has changed since then. Hesitant acceptance of transgender people has dissolved into a national furor over bathroom laws. And among liberals, initial enthusiasm for Jenner faded with the discovery that she is a Republican who admired Ted Cruz!
I accompanied Jenner as she visited a Brooklyn school, the Academy for Young Writers, that is in a gritty, working-class neighborhood and that has been a leader in making L.G.B.T. students feel welcome. The meeting was a collision of sorts: a wealthy transgender celebrity encountering a group of low-income L.G.B.T. teenagers of color, coming from different worlds but sharing anxieties and pain.
The students challenged Jenner, and some had earlier pulled down a photo of Jenner from a wall because they felt she wasn’t doing enough for L.G.B.T. people. Jenner spoke with the students for hours, winning them over by airing differences (and taking selfies with them) while also bonding over common concerns — like the North Carolina bathroom law.
“It’s a total misunderstanding of the issue,” Jenner said, arguing that there are already laws to deal with predators and that there have been no reported case of a trans woman ever entering a women’s restroom and abusing anyone.
The real people to worry about, she said, are trans kids who are struggling with bullying and ostracism. One national study found that 41 percent of trans people surveyed had attempted suicide, 57 percent had experienced family rejection and almost one-fifth had endured homelessness.
Some of the students in the room have faced just these challenges. Spencer Washington, a black 17-year-old who was assumed female at birth but has felt male since he was a toddler, once attempted suicide (fortunately, he couldn’t manage a hangman’s knot and cried himself to sleep).
“Let people pee in peace,” Spencer pleaded.
Less than 1 percent of the population — one rough estimate is perhaps one-third of 1 percent — is transgender, a far smaller share than is gay. Jenner thus puts a face on a category of people prone to be vilified, a group that may be among the most marginalized in America.
Jenner says that the hardest thing about coming out as a woman was the criticisms from the transgender community, and she acknowledges she had a lot to learn: Until a year ago, she had never met a transgender person. But she says she finally feels authentic about her identity.
I became interested in these issues after coming across homeless kids struggling with school, drugs, police, sexual abuse and suicide — and disproportionately they were transgender kids who had been rejected by family and society.
That’s what I think the public doesn’t get: Sure, there are complicated issues of which sports team a child should be on, or which shower to use, but those are secondary. The primary concern should be to keep kids safe and alive — and not in crisis each time their bladders fill.
So remember, this isn’t about Jenner, who can look after herself. It’s about the thousands of kids across the country who, on top of all the craziness of adolescence, are also realizing, often to their horror, that their bodies and souls do not align, and that as a result they may face a lifetime as pariahs. We can do better than that.
