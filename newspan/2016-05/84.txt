The hullabaloo over Amnesty’s stance on sex work started last summer, when 500 delegates from 80 countries voted in favor of an initial recommendation to decriminalize. The recommendation was denounced by groups whose goal is to end prostitution, which they see as a source of sexual inequality and harmful to women. Amnesty drew support from public-health advocates and activists who see decriminalization as the best means of reducing the harms associated with the sex industry, including underage prostitution, trafficking and violence. The debate will surely repeat itself, and it will almost as surely be rife with accusations of betrayal.
In a letter to the editor published in this magazine last Sunday, Gloria Steinem called the Nordic Model “more successful than any other model because it recognizes the power difference between buyer and bought.” She didn’t provide evidence. In researching my article, and in the outpouring of criticism of it from abolitionists, I couldn’t find a convincing case for the Nordic model. Let’s see what the response to Amnesty’s latest reports brings.
