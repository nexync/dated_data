In just six short years, Roll & Hill has developed a cult following for its hand-crafted lighting fixtures produced in collaboration with some of the most respected independent designers working today — totaling about 15, and including the likes of Lindsey Adelman — all without a proper showroom. But beginning Saturday, the public will be able to view the collection in one place for the first time, without having to attend a trade show or trek out to the company’s Sunset Park, Brooklyn, headquarters.
Roll & Hill’s first showroom is located in SoHo, on a block that feels like “you’ve found a little secret,” says the company’s founder, Jason Miller. In a one-time warehouse for Canal Hi-Fi, on Mercer where Howard Street ends (or begins, depending on your point of view), the showroom has never before been open to the public. “It’s 4,000 square feet spread over three floors, so there’s a lot of places to show lights,” Miller says. “We’re going to be putting in some furniture to give context to our pieces, with the idea that everything is for sale.” In addition to lighting, the Roll & Hill showroom will offer a tight edit of upholstery and cabinetry by Miller, a shelving collection by Philippe Malouin, some pieces by Finn Juhl and Golran carpets.
Miller is quick to stress that although it is open to the public, Roll & Hill’s showroom is not a retail store — most items are available to order only. But the company’s new line of smaller accessories, including some table lamps, floor lamps and candleholders, will be available for on-site purchase by the end of summer.
