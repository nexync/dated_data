Long before Instagram feeds and MasterChef cook-offs highlighted a near-universal obsession with the visual appearance of food, a craftsman in 19th-century China meticulously carved and dyed a chunk of jasper, a jade-like stone, to look like a piece of braised pork belly. The National Palace Museum in Taipei has long showcased this uncanny sculpture, known as “the meat-shaped stone,” as one of its most prized holdings, very rarely loaning it out. But now the glistening dish is leaving Taipei to make its North American debut in a city that celebrates Chinese cuisine: San Francisco.
He noted that about 100 of the 150 objects in the show, which date to the 11th century, have never traveled to the United States before. The others appeared 20 years ago in “Possessing the Past: Treasures from the National Palace Museum, Taipei,” a show that originated at the Metropolitan Museum of Art when Mr. Xu was getting his curatorial start there.
The museum is also staging a restaurant tie-in: 12 local chefs, including Michelle Mah of the Slanted Door, Anthony Myint of Mission Chinese and Brandon Jew of Mister Jiu’s, will feature pork belly dishes on their menus during the first month of the show.
