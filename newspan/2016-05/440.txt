The Secret Service said it would investigate Donald J. Trump’s longtime butler over Facebook posts laced with vulgarities and epithets calling for President Obama to be killed.
The racially tinged posts by the butler, Anthony Senecal, were unearthed by Mother Jones on Thursday, and referred to Mr. Obama as a “Kenyan fraud” who should be hanged for treason.
Mr. Senecal did not immediately respond to a telephone call and Facebook message seeking comment.
The posts were revealed as Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has come under scrutiny for his associations with, and support from figures such as the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump’s campaign aides said a technical glitch had included William Johnson, a self-proclaimed white nationalist, on a list of California delegates they submitted to the Secretary of State’s office.
Some of Mr. Senecal’s other Facebook posts aimed at Ferguson protesters and various public figures, including Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for president, whom he called “Killery Clinton”; Beyoncé; and the Republican National Committee, which has quarreled with Mr. Trump through the nomination process. The committee members should be hanged for treason, he wrote in March.
