File footage shows the missing EgyptAir airbus as it took off from Brussels Airport in September 2015.
The fact that Egyptian authorities said that they were looking into whether terrorism had caused the crash of the EgyptAir flight from Paris to Cairo early Thursday morning raised fears about the safety of air travel and also traveling in general. Here’s what you need to know about staying safe in the skies and on the ground.
The EgyptAir flight 804 that crashed originated in Paris. Does this mean that the city and France in general are at an increased risk for a terrorist attack?
Yes, but so are other countries in Europe, including Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom, said Nick Doyle, a terrorism expert and managing director of the security risk management practice at Kroll. “Intelligence says that an attack is highly likely, but, obviously, no one knows when or where,” he said.
So, should I avoid traveling to France since this recent possible attack happened on a flight departing France?
There is no reason not to travel to France, according to Martin Stone, the head of Europe, Middle East and Africa for the New York City-based global investigation firm Nardello & Co., but travelers should be aware that there are several major sports events happening in the country over the next several months such as the French Open, taking place now through early June; the UEFA European Championship, the soccer tournament from June 10 through July 10; and the Tour de France, starting July 2. Large-scale events like these, said Mr. Stone, are potential terrorist targets.
The plane that crashed was headed to Cairo. Does that mean that Egypt is an unsafe travel destination?
It’s hard to say whether Egypt is categorically unsafe, according to Rana Feghali, the head of Nardello’s Dubai practice. But, she said, since the EgyptAir plane had stops in Tunisia and Cairo, a security breach in one of those destinations could have led to an explosive device being loaded onto the plane. That said, the cause of the crash has not yet been determined.
What are the chances of a terrorist attack happening on a plane?
Very small. An estimated 3.5 billion people flew globally in 2015 according to the International Air Transport Association, a trade association for the world’s airlines. According to Perry Flint, the organization’s head of corporate communications in the Americas, that same year, there were two deliberate acts of unlawful interference against commercial transport aircrafts that led to the loss of passenger lives: Germanwings 9525 because of a pilot suicide and Metrojet 9268 where terrorism is the suspected cause. Both of these incidents resulted in the deaths of 374 passengers and crew- barely a fraction of the total number of fliers.
The risk of air terrorism may be small said Mike Ackerman, the founder and chairman of the Ft. Lauderdale-based security consulting firm Ackerman Group who is an expert in travel-related terrorism, but the fear around it is big. “The incidence of air terrorism is statistically insignificant but psychologically significant because it’s so terrifying,” he said.
Is it safer to fly domestically within the United States than internationally?
T.J. Schulz, the president of the trade association Airport Consultants Council and an aviation security expert, said that the risk of air terrorism domestically is extremely low. “The last successful air terrorist attack in the U.S. was 9/11, and though there have been attempts since then like the underwear and shoe bombers, the airport security at U.S. airports is far more rigorous and layered now than it was when 9/11 happened which makes an attack much more difficult,” he said.
Is there anything I can do to stay safe from air terrorism?
Mr. Ackerman advises travelers to limit their air travel to carriers from industrialized countries because they tend to have the most thorough security standards. “Fliers sometimes want to avoid American carriers because they think that America is a terrorist target, but American airlines and other industrialized countries have rigorous security screening procedures,” he said.
How can I protect myself from terrorism in general?
Mr. Doyle says that travelers should be aware of any potential safety risks at the destination they’re heading to. And, in a recent New York Times article on travel to Europe, Tim Horner, the head of Kroll’s security risk management practice, advised avoiding crowded areas such as concert halls and stadiums and having an exit strategy in place if you do go. He also suggested knowing how to get around the city you’re in, emailing your itinerary and copies of your travel documents, including your passport, to family members, and limiting the amount of personal information you carry (no need to tote along all your credit cards).
