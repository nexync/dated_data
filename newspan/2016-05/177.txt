So Ms. Fong changed her life. She moved to Paris, enrolled in fashion design classes in London and plotted with her sister to open a luxury handbag company. And after the global economic crisis scuttled her plans, she didn’t crumble; with Jobs-like determination, she applied to business school.
Today she is the 32-year-old creative director of MDB Family, a children’s furniture business with six divisions, including Nursery Works, which she repositioned two years ago to emphasize high-end design. She is also the creative director of Capsule, a new MDB company selling more affordably priced home furnishings directly to consumers. Both brands will be exhibiting at the WantedDesign Manhattan show May 13 to 16.
Those circumstances also allow her to experiment with design. “My vision is for Capsule to be the Opening Ceremony of furniture,” she said, referring to the eclectic fashion retailer and producer known for its creative collaborations (and recently granted a 2016 National Design Award).
