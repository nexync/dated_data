In an effort to limit profiteering, the hit musical “Hamilton” took two steps this week intended to make reselling tickets more difficult.
The producers have long sought to limit reselling by capping the number of tickets that could be purchased per person. This week, Ticketmaster canceled purchases that exceeded those limits; on Wednesday night, the show’s producers abruptly released those tickets for sale. This was announced via Twitter, and the tickets (neither “Hamilton” nor Ticketmaster would reveal the number) were quickly snapped up by new buyers. The Twitter post from “Hamilton” promoting the sale has since been deleted.
“When people exceeded the limits, we refunded them, and we pooled all the refunds and put them on sale,” said the show’s lead producer, Jeffrey Seller.
The producers also announced via Twitter new rules for people waiting in line, often round-the-clock, outside the Richard Rodgers Theater, hoping to buy the few tickets released by the box office just before each show. Tents and chairs are now prohibited, and last-minute buyers must go directly from the box office into the theater. The hope is to reduce the role of line-sitters paid to camp overnight.
On two theater chat boards, unnamed ticket holders who were planning to travel to New York to see “Hamilton” complained that they were unfairly caught up in the crackdown, and had lost their tickets to the show.
Ticketmaster declined to comment for this report.
