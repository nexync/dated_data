Bill Backer, a lapsed lyricist whose classic 1971 commercial taught a fractious world of potential Coca-Cola consumers to sing in perfect harmony and was featured in the finale of “Mad Men,” died on Friday in Warrenton, Va. He was 89.
His death was confirmed by his wife and only immediate survivor, the former Ann Mudge.
He also anointed the break devoted to beer drinking as “Miller Time,” reserved festive occasions for Löwenbräu (“Here’s to good friends, tonight is kind of special”), and created advertising campaigns for Fisher-Price, Hyundai cars, Parliament cigarettes, Philip Morris, Quaker Foods and Xerox.
But Mr. Backer had no illusions about what collaboration he would be remembered for, as he told The New York Times in 1993 when he was about to retire as vice chairman and worldwide creative director of Backer Spielvogel Bates after a four-decade career in advertising.
His little hymn, “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing (in Perfect Harmony),” became a memorable commercial for Coca-Cola, a hit record, the inspiration for a sequel Super Bowl advertisement in 1991 and a coda for “Mad Men” on AMC last year.
Mr. Backer’s own epiphany behind what became known as the hilltop commercial was not quite as blissful.
According to his account in a company-sponsored video, he was on his way to London in January 1971 to meet with the songwriters Billy Davis and Roger Cook when his flight was diverted by fog to Shannon Airport in Ireland.
The next morning, Mr. Backer was stunned to see the diverse group of passengers who had been angry the night before cheerfully conversing in the coffee shop.
The three songwriters concurred on the lyrics, and the vocal group the New Seekers recorded it for radio (adapting the tune from a song by Mr. Cook and Roger Greenaway).
Coca-Cola’s president deemed it too sappy. Coke bottlers hated it. So Mr. Backer persuaded the company to try a video version instead. Harvey Gabor, a young art director, envisioned a diverse chorus in native outfits lip-syncing. A near-record $250,000 was approved for production.
A cast was rehearsed at the white cliffs of Dover, but after a three-day downpour, production was shifted to a hillside outside Rome. At first, hundreds of impatient and parched schoolchildren unharmoniously stampeded to grab free bottles of soda. A new cast was finally recruited, the commercial became a success, and recordings by both the New Seekers and the Hillside Singers (with the reference to Coke removed) hit the Billboard charts.
William Montague Backer was born in Manhattan on June 9, 1926, to William Bryant Backer, a real estate developer, and the former Ferdinanda Legare. His father died when he was 6, and he moved with his mother to her native South Carolina.
He wrote musical comedies in high school, served in the Navy and graduated from Yale in 1950. He hoped to become a songwriter but was persuaded by his mother and stepfather, Dr. Joseph I. Waring, to go into a more legitimate business, like real estate, which he did briefly.
He then started a jingle business before leaving for Columbia Pictures, but was so critical of the commercials being produced there that he was fired. His boss suggested an ad agency.
In 1953, he went to work in the mailroom at McCann Erickson. He was named creative director in 1972 and vice chairman in 1978. A year later, he and Carl Spielvogel, a former advertising columnist for The Times and an executive at McCann’s owner, Interpublic, formed their own agency.
By 1984, Backer & Spielvogel was billing more than $400 million a year. In 1986, it was bought by the British company Saatchi & Saatchi for a reported down payment of $56 million, with $45 million more paid over six years, and merged with Ted Bates Worldwide.
After Mr. Backer retired, he moved to Virginia, where he owned a thoroughbred horse farm and was president of the Piedmont Foundation, which supports land conservation.
