The New York Drama Critics’ Circle has named “Shuffle Along” the best new musical of the season, and “The Humans” the best new play.
The awards are significant because they are chosen by theater critics, but have limited predictive value for the Tony Awards because the critics consider both Broadway and Off Broadway shows each season, so they are often out of sync with the Tonys cycle. The group had named “Hamilton” the best new musical last season, when it played Off Broadway at the Public Theater, making that show ineligible for this year’s award.
“Shuffle Along,” which has the full title of “Shuffle Along, or The Making of the Musical Sensation of 1921 and All That Followed,” is a jazz-and-tap show that explores the history of an early all-black Broadway musical. It features songs from the 1921 musical by Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, and a new book by George C. Wolfe, who also directed the show.
“The Humans,” written by Stephen Karam and directed by Joe Mantello, is about a close-knit family grappling over Thanksgiving dinner with a series of unexpected disappointments and challenges.
“Shuffle Along” has been nominated for a Tony Award for best new musical, but “Hamilton” is widely expected to win that category. “The Humans” has been nominated for a Tony Award for best new play, and is a leading contender in that category.
The Drama Critics’ Circle includes 22 New York-area theater critics. Critics from The New York Times are not part of the organization.
