Would you really want it to remain on your fingers? Indefinitely?
These are just two of the salient questions raised by the chicken chain’s new Hong Kong marketing campaign, in which it is offering lickable, edible fingernail polish in two flavors: Original, and Hot and Spicy.
And, as you might expect...
A more logical question would be why.
The polish is made in conjunction with McCormick & Company, which produces the spices for KFC’s chicken. It has yet to be mass produced but could be available in the second half of this year.
KFC is asking Hong Kong customers which flavor they would prefer. “Neither” apparently is not an option.
Ms. Mugglestone said there has been “vast interest” in the polish, but comments online ranged from skeptical to harsh.
“Gross/intriguing,” the fashion and lifestyle website Racked.com tweeted.
