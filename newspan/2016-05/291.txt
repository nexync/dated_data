You Are in the Sea. Your Stuff Is on the Beach. Now What?
You’re alone at the beach, or maybe in a pair or a small group. It’s pretty hot out there, so it’s time to cool down in the water.
How do you make sure your phone, money and keys aren’t stolen?
It’s a simple question with no easy answer, especially if you don’t have a car nearby. While it’s easy to suggest leaving your valuables at home or at a hotel — which is, indeed, sensible advice — that option isn’t always practical or desirable.
When I posed the question to my Facebook friends, I got a surprising variety of responses.
• “Dig a hole, place your stuff in a zip lock, cover the hole and place your beach blanket on top of it,” Javi Calderón offered.
• “Get one of those dorky plastic waterproof compartments to wear around your neck,” Pamela Hobart suggested, knowing full well I have no problem wearing dorky things.
• “Wrap your valuables in a shirt and leave a bag sitting out in the open, so a potential thief would grab the wrong thing,” Jessica Lee said.
• “I’ll generally put all my belongings in a bag and stuff that in another bag, tie that bag to my sandals or something and put it under my beach towels when I’m going to the water,” Michael Ip said.
Yeah, we knew that was coming. But since many of us will bring our phones anyway, he added a few more novel ideas, like stashing your cash in a cleaned-out suntan lotion bottle or a split tennis ball. While no single method could bring total peace of mind, the idea is to make yourself as unattractive a target to thieves as possible.
