WASHINGTON — The Navy on Thursday reassigned the officer who commanded the 10 sailors who were detained by Iran in January after their boats strayed into its territorial waters, the service said in a statement.
The officer, Cmdr. Eric Rasch, was relieved of his duties because the Navy had lost “confidence in his ability to command,” the statement said.
The Navy said the decision was made after a preliminary investigation, but it provided no other details. It is expected to release the findings of the inquiry in the coming weeks. Some of the sailors are expected to be reprimanded.
On Jan. 12, two patrol boats that were being moved to Bahrain from Kuwait came within a few miles of Farsi Island in the Persian Gulf, the home of an Iranian military base, after making a navigational error, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said that month.
Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps boats stopped the American vessels, made the sailors put their hands behind their heads and detained them. The Iranians later released video of the episode, including a clip of an American sailor giving an apology.
Republicans seized on the issue, saying President Obama had tolerated the humiliation of the sailors.
News of the episode broke hours before Mr. Obama was to give his final State of the Union address. He did not mention the sailors in the speech.
In the hours after the sailors’ detention, Secretary of State John F. Kerry called his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to urge him to have the sailors released. The two men had grown close while negotiating the agreement that led Iran to curtail its nuclear program.
The following morning, the sailors were released. Administration officials asserted that the action demonstrated a benefit of the nation’s improved relationship with Iran.
