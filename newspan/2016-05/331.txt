The truth is more cynical still. Kenyan forces that had invaded Somalia to combat the Shabab, extremists affiliated with Al Qaeda, were last year revealed to be collaborating with the very same group in smuggling charcoal and sugar to the tune of up to $400 million. In response, the Somali government passed a motion calling for the withdrawal of Kenyan troops from Somalia. Going on the offensive against refugees means international energy will be focused on persuading Kenya not to close the refugee camps, rather than on making it behave itself in Somalia.
This is dangerous. Eighty percent of displaced people in the world are hosted in developing nations. The world is moving toward a situation in which the rights of refugees are enumerated not in international laws and treaties but in dollars and euros. Earlier this month, the European Union agreed to a change to its common asylum policy that allowed member states to refuse to accept their quota of refugees resettled from front-line countries, like Greece and Italy, for a “solidarity contribution” of 250,000 euros (about $283,000) per head.
