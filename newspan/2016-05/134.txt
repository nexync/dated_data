President Obama confirmed on Monday that Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, the leader of the Afghan Taliban, had been killed in an American air strike in a remote region just inside the Pakistani side of the border.
HANOI, Vietnam — An American drone strike on Saturday in a restive province of Pakistan killed Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, the leader of the Afghan Taliban, the White House confirmed on Monday.
At a news conference with President Tran Dai Quang of Vietnam, Mr. Obama said that targeting Mullah Mansour in the drone strike did not represent a shift in strategy for the United States mission in Afghanistan.
“We are not re-entering the day-to-day combat operations that are currently being conducted by Afghanistan forces,” he said.
But Mullah Mansour was a danger to American forces there, he added.
“He is an individual who as head of the Taliban was specifically targeting U.S. personnel and troops inside of Afghanistan who are there as part of the mission I have set to maintain a counterterrorism platform and provide assistance,” Mr. Obama said.
The strike was the first such American drone attack in the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan, which is the de facto headquarters of the Afghan Taliban. Nearly all other drone strikes have taken place in other Pakistani and Afghan areas.
The death of Mullah Mansour, who was consolidating his authority over a fracturing Taliban as the militants made major gains on the battlefield, throws the insurgency into its second leadership crisis in a year. Still, it was unclear whether it would create any significant breathing space for the government of President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan, which has struggled to bring the insurgency into negotiations.
