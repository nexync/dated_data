A Yale professor and his wife who became targets of protests for an email about potentially offensive Halloween costumes are resigning their positions as heads of a residential community at the university.
The professor, Nicholas Christakis, a sociologist and physician, announced on his Twitter feed Wednesday that he was stepping down as head of Silliman College, a residence where he and his wife served as social and intellectual mentors to students.
Dr. Christakis, who directs Yale’s Human Nature Lab, said they were not severing all their ties to the university. He will stay on as a tenured professor. His wife, Erika Christakis, who recently published a book about preschool, will continue her work in that field, he said, though he did not specify in what capacity. The resignations are effective in July.
Dr. Christakis said he would not make other public statements on the matter, and he did not say why the couple made their decision to resign now. The Yale Daily News, which reported their resignations on Wednesday, said that some students refused to accept their diplomas from Dr. Christakis during Silliman College’s graduation ceremony on Monday.
The couple stirred debate last fall, after Yale’s Intercultural Affairs Committee wrote a memo warning students against wearing culturally or racially insensitive Halloween costumes.
Ms. Christakis responded with a long, searching email of her own, wondering whether Yale students really wanted to cede authority over their Halloween costumes to the administration.
“Are we all O.K. with this transfer of power? Have we lost faith in young people’s capacity — in your capacity — to exercise self-censure, through social norming, and also in your capacity to ignore or reject things that trouble you?” she wrote.
Some students accused the couple of racial and cultural insensitivity and demanded that they resign as heads of Silliman College. They decided not to teach this semester, but remained in their residential posts, until now.
