Good morning. Greece enters a new economic phase, Indonesia faces more earthquakes and Bhutan blossoms into a literary hub.
• Greece enters an uneasy era of financial independence.
As of today, the country officially ends its reliance on bailouts that totaled over 320 billion euros, or about $366 billion, bringing the country to the finish line of a debt crisis that almost broke the European Union apart. Above, tourists in Athens.
But that doesn’t mean the painful part is over. Even as the country inches toward growth eight years after its first loan, more than a third of its population is in poverty, and it has the highest unemployment rate in the eurozone.
• Fading hopes for Turkey.
At one point, the Western world hoped to hold up Turkey as proof that Islam could peacefully coexist with democracy and liberal values.
The country was a reliable NATO ally in a region bogged down by religious conflict and sought European Union membership, while President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, above, presented himself as a moderate Muslim leader.
That was before Mr. Erdogan started to expand his power, crack down on dissent and drag Turkey into an economic crisis, all of which have diminished optimistic visions for it.
• President Trump attacks The New York Times.
The president lashed out against what he called a “fake” report that described extensive cooperation between the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, above, and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.
The Times article states that Mr. McGahn, fearing he would be thrown under the bus by the president, voluntarily sat down with investigators for 30 hours over the past nine months. It said Mr. McGahn detailed with unusual candor the president’s comments and actions when firing James B. Comey as F.B.I. director and Mr. Trump’s obsession with putting a loyalist in charge of the Russia inquiry.
In other news about Mr. Trump’s inner circle, Michael D. Cohen, his former personal lawyer, is being investigated for bank and tax fraud related to $20 million in loans. Prosecutors are considering filing charges against Mr. Cohen by the end of August.
• Some migrants from Africa enter Europe by embarking on perilous sea journeys. Others breach fences topped with barbed wire.
Ceuta is one of two Spanish enclaves on the north coast of Africa, the only European places that have land borders with the vast continent. The only thing separating Ceuta from Morocco is the double fence pictured above.
After Italy’s new populist government slammed the door to new migrants and threatened to throw out the ones already in the country, crossing into Spain is becoming an increasingly attractive option.
That has made Ceuta the latest flash point in Europe’s wider conversation about migrants.
• Uber’s executives are divided about the future of its autonomous vehicle business, months after one of its self-driving cars killed a pedestrian, with one camp pushing to sell off the expensive unit as the company prepares for an I.P.O.
• New economic research suggests that in the United States sexism can follow women from the cradle to the workplace, with where they were born, in particular, having an outsize impact on how much they end up earning.
• A new consulting firm staffed by teenagers is helping brands reach a younger demographic by helping them steer clear of “cringey” phrases and stay on top of social media trends.
• Finding it hard to focus? Maybe it’s not your fault.
• You don’t need an art degree to appreciate art.
• Recipe of the day: Looking for something light and refreshing? A crunchy herb and radish salad with feta will do the trick.
• In memoriam: Kofi Annan, 80, above, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and the first black African head of the United Nations.
• The tiny Kingdom of Bhutan, tucked away in the Himalayas, had a literacy rate of 3 percent in the 1950s. Today, that rate has shot up to 60 percent, and the country is being transformed into a thriving literary hub with the rise of a new generation of authors.
• Winter is coming. For the Croatian city of Dubrovnik, where the fictional King’s Landing from “Game of Thrones” is set, that means a welcome break from crushing hordes of fans of the popular HBO series.
Chirping crickets. A baby cooing. Crashing waves. A greeting from President Jimmy Carter.
Those were some of the contents of the so-called Golden Record that was attached to NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft, which was launched for Jupiter and Saturn 41 years ago today. Voyager 1, which launched on Sept. 5, 1977, also carries a record.
The spacecraft were designed to explore the outer solar system, but the record (actually made of copper) also carried a message to any extraterrestrials that may find it: sounds and images that best represented humankind and life on Earth. In addition to sounds of nature, there were musical pieces and greetings in 55 languages. Above, the cover of the record.
The astronomer Carl Sagan led the effort to compile the record, an ambitious process that was fraught with indecision. In addition to the technical issues of creating a record that could withstand the pressures of space, there was also the philosophical burden of how to best paint a picture of our planet.

Correction: Friday’s briefing referred incorrectly to the organization that operated the plane whose wreckage was discovered in Switzerland. It was a division of the United States Army, not the Air Force.
