Overweight people who lost 5 to 10 percent of their weight lowered their risk for metabolic syndrome by 22 percent. Those who lost 20 percent cut their risk by over 50 percent.
When it comes to losing weight, more can be better. A lot better, according to a new study.
Researchers studied 7,670 overweight or obese people who wanted to lose weight. Using data on current weight, weight a year ago and maximum lifetime weight, they tested the association of long-term weight loss with lowering the risk for metabolic syndrome — a constellation of unhealthy conditions that includes high blood pressure, insulin resistance, excess fat around the waist, high triglycerides and low HDL, or “good,” cholesterol.
Compared to people who maintained less than a 5 percent weight loss for one year, those who lost 5 to 10 percent lowered their risk for metabolic syndrome by 22 percent. A 15 to 19 percent loss was associated with a 37 percent lower risk, and those who maintained a loss of 20 percent or more had a 53 percent lower risk. The study is in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.
Only 5.5 percent of the participants succeeded in holding a 20 percent or greater weight loss for one year.
