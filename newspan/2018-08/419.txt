Louis C.K. made an unannounced appearance at the Comedy Cellar on Sunday night, according to the club’s owner, performing for apparently the first time since he admitted last year to sexual misconduct with women in the comedy world.
One audience member called the club on Monday to object to the surprise set, the owner said. “He wished he had known in advance, so he could’ve decided whether to have been there or not,” Mr. Dworman said. But several other patrons responded to a standard email follow-up from the club to say they were happy they caught the show.
Last November, five women came forward to describe inappropriate conduct by Louis C.K., including instances in which he masturbated in front of them. In a statement soon after, he admitted to the misconduct. It led to the end of his production deal with the FX Networks and the canceled release of a film he wrote, directed and starred in, “I Love You, Daddy,” which included scenes reminiscent of his behavior. He has kept a low profile since, one of dozens of men who have been toppled in the aftermath of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the rise of the #MeToo movement.
