Aretha Franklin, who died Thursday at 76, was one of the titanic figures in American pop music. She was central to the secularization of the gospel impulse in the 1960s, and her vision of soul music became the soundtrack to the civil rights movement. In addition to these ideological innovations, she could sing in a way that made all other singers sound irrelevant, tired, mushy.
She sang at Martin Luther King Jr.’s funeral and Barack Obama’s first inauguration. She covered the Beatles, Otis Redding and Adele. She was a vivacious stage presence with signature style. And she was famously protective of her privacy and her public narrative.
Mr. Ritz helps answer questions about Ms. Franklin’s offstage life and how she told her own story, which often excluded difficult details of her childhood. “We all have strategies for emotional survival, and her strategy for emotional survival was idealization,” he said. “Ultimately, I had to respect that. Because that was how she got through.” She had one child at 12, and another at 14. (She never revealed publicly who fathered them, but in Mr. Ritz’s “Respect,” Ms. Franklin’s brother, Cecil, says the father of the first was “just a guy she knew from school” and that “She wasn’t all that interested in him.”) And she dropped out of school after having them in order to focus on her career, leaving her grandmother and others with heavy child-rearing responsibilities. “She used her queendom to ensure the kind of privacy that was important to her,” Mr. Ritz said.
