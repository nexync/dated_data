A sweeping report issued by a grand jury in Pennsylvania sheds new light on the systemic nature of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.
A grand jury report found that Roman Catholic priests had abused more than 1,000 children in Pennsylvania over a period of 70 years. Some church officials say the report reiterates issues that have already been addressed, but details suggest otherwise.

The report, which describes a system of cover-ups by church officials, is the most far-reaching examination by a United States government agency thus far of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church.
Catholics — some of whom had stayed with the church after explosive revelations of priest abuse over a decade ago — are grappling with the report’s revelations.
The report begins, “We, the members of this grand jury, need you to hear this.” Read excerpts here.
