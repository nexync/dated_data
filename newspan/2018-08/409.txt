No blade of grass, no rose bush nor flower bed, was safe from the goats.
Goats don’t belong on West Summerwind Drive, a quiet residential area in Boise, Idaho. But don’t tell them that. Goats roam where they please, and around 7:15 a.m. Friday, bewildered homeowners awoke to find more than 100 of the animals casing the neighborhood, looking for anything they could munch on.
The local television station KTVB, the leading authority on Boise goat invasions, got the scoop. It was closely chronicled by Joe Parris, a politics and breaking news reporter who made a strong case for any goat-related journalism awards.
The goats busted out of a nearby field, where a company that rents the animals for landscaping purposes — goats are good at eating weeds — had kept them.
The company, We Rent Goats, said in an email late Friday that 118 goats were supposed to be eating noxious weeds at a nearby pond. But in a case of overzealous chomping, the goats stood up on their back feet and leaned against some wooden boards to nibble on tall weeds. The boards broke, and the goats escaped.
Mr. Parris said in an interview that the goats were friendly, and that he got to pet one. They weren’t very noisy, aside from the chewing. The smell, he said, was awful.
But while the residents were witnessing real-time property damage, they seemed to be in a good mood about it. Children jumped up and down in excitement.
The goat-renting company has insurance “and will be following up with neighbors whose landscaping was damaged,” said Haley Williams, a spokeswoman for the Boise Police Department.
For Mr. Parris, covering a sudden goat rodeo was significantly more fun than covering the wildfires that have raged in Idaho in recent days.
“I had a great morning,” he said.
