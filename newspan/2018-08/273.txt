What’s your mood? What’s your taste? Do you like “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” or “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”? The Times TV critic Margaret Lyons has recommendations below on what you should tune into this week.
“Younger” has been fabulous this season, especially because the writers finally decided to let the cast sing, even just a little. Sutton Foster sang a song from “The Sound of Music” earlier this season in a moment that was charming but contrived, like the show itself. This week, it’s Miriam Shor’s turn, and she duets with the guest star Martha Plimpton. Next week is the season finale, so savor this episode like the last day of summer vacation. Maybe Hilary Duff will get her big musical number in Season 6.

Every episode of the family drama “Queen Sugar” has a big catharsis, and this is a 90-minute season finale, so prepare for rage and weeping. This season has been an interesting step forward for the show, as the cloud of grief around the Bordelon siblings has lifted. That’s meant more of their problems have been about confronting their futures — especially for Charley, who has uprooted her life and taken on a new career — than just revisiting their previous conflicts. It’s made for more interesting but sometimes less revealing storylines.
This documentary tells the story of Kristen Ries and Maggie Snyder, a doctor and a physician assistant who treated HIV and AIDS patients in Salt Lake City, Utah, starting in the early 1980s.
