A reader calls on the Catholic Church to have an in-depth inquiry involving all parishes and priests.
In the wake of the ecclesiastical mea culpas surrounding last week’s Pennsylvania clerical abuse report, we’ve yet to hear a realistic plan of action to restore the world’s shattered confidence in the Roman Catholic Church.
Taking a cue from Desmond Tutu and post-apartheid South Africa, I propose a churchwide program of truth and reconciliation commissions. These would operate on a parish level and be run by the laity. All clergy active in a given parish would answer, under oath and on camera, questions regarding his level of participation or knowledge of the child abuse scandal. The results wouldn’t vanish into a secret archive. They’d be indexed and archived on social media, available to everyone worldwide.
We know the names of some abusers, and the names of some who hid abusers’ crimes. We need to hear from — what shall we call them? — the unindicted co-conspirators, the priests who knew what was going on down the rectory hall, in their brother priests’ bedrooms, in the corner of the sacristy after mass.
This silent majority allowed this culture to fester and thrive. Everyone has to come clean. Only then can we begin to heal as a church.
