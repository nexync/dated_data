After this week, individual Metropolitan Diary items will no longer be posted online. Starting Monday, Aug. 27, the full column will appear weekly online as it does in print.
It was August 1947. I had recently graduated from high school and was looking forward to going off to college in a couple of weeks.
After being relocated from the Manhattan’s gas house district to make way for Stuyvesant Town, my parents had started operating a storefront grocery on 10th Avenue near 49th Street. I couldn’t believe my good luck. I was just two blocks from Madison Square Garden and just three blocks from Broadway.
Boxing was still a major event then, with Joe Louis, Willie Pep, Rocky Graziano and Jake LaMotta still filling seats at the Garden. Jack Dempsey had his restaurant and bar nearby. I would spend time outside the place, hoping for a glimpse of my all-time favorite champ at his regular table by the window.
At that time, 18 was the legal age to be served spirits in a bar, and I had not quite turned 17. Still, consumed by the thought of seeing my idol, I threw caution to the wind. After donning a neatly pressed dark blue suit, a white shirt and one of my dad’s neckties, I set off to get close enough to Dempsey to get an autograph.
Entering the restaurant, I puffed out my chest, strode up to the bar and ordered a beer. The bartender’s first glance told me I was in trouble. He didn’t have to ask for my ID. He knew. A floor manager came over, smiled at me and gently, but swiftly, ushered me out the door.
Thankfully, nobody seemed to notice. I wouldn’t have been able to handle it if the Manassa Mauler saw me being kicked out of his joint without even putting up a fight.
