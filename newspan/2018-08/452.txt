If the standard set of folders that comes with the Windows 10 Mail program are not enough, you add and delete your own.
Q. How do I create folders for saving specific incoming emails in Windows 10? How do I delete a folder when it is no longer needed?
A. If you are using the Mail for Windows 10 program that came with the system, you can set up a new folder in just a few steps. The program comes with its own set of default folders — like Inbox, Drafts, Sent, for starters — that you can’t delete. If you want to set up custom folders to store messages from a specific person or about a certain topic (like a home renovation project), you can add and delete those at will.
To get started, open the Mail program. If you have more than one email account set up within the app, choose the account you want to use and select the More option on the left side of the window to see the All Folders list. Click or tap the plus (+) icon next to All Folders to make a new folder for the account. You can also right-click on one of the existing folders to get the option to make a new sub-folder within it. Type in a label name for the folder and press the Enter key to add it.
You can then use this new folder to store the appropriate messages. When you no longer need the folder you created, go back to that mail account, and select the More option. Right-click on the folder you no longer need and select Delete from the drop-down menu.
Several other desktop mail programs also allow you to make your own folders or sub-folders in a similar manner. One major exception is the web-based version of Gmail, which offers a system of custom labels for sorting messages.
