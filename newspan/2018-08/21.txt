The Broadway revival of the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical “Carousel” will close on September 16 after a surprisingly short six-month run.
Though it opened to largely positive reviews and was nominated for 11 Tony Awards, the box office has dropped sharply. Ticket sales peaked the week of April 29 at $1,289,712; for the week ending August 5, the show earned $675,660, about 42 percent of its potential.
Directed by Jack O’Brien and choreographed by the ballet star Justin Peck, “Carousel” stars Joshua Henry as the ill-fated carnival barker Billy Bigelow, Jessie Mueller as his love interest Julie Jordan, and the opera singer Renée Fleming, in her Broadway musical debut, as Nettie Fowler. The show won two Tonys, for Mr. Peck’s choreography and for Lindsay Mendez in a supporting role.
The production is the fifth revival of the musical, which first opened on Broadway in 1945. The last revival, in 1994, played for about a year and won five Tonys.
The new “Carousel” arrived at a moment of debate over the portrayal of women in classic musicals. A Broadway revival of “My Fair Lady,” which drew similar concerns, opened at about the same time but has turned out to be more popular, earning $1,269,449 last week.
