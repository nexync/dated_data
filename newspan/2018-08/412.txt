What’s your mood? What’s your taste? Do you like “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” or “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt”? The Times TV critic Margaret Lyons has recommendations below on what you should tune into this week.
This documentary series about the marching band at Bethune-Cookman University in Florida follows the quintessential sports-story arc: Arduous auditions where some veterans are surprised to be cut, a grueling practice schedule not everyone can endure, a few squabbles that ultimately lead to increased closeness, and finally the big competition everyone’s been waiting for. The show’s 12 episodes clock in around 10 minutes each, but it still manages to be absorbing and compelling.
The second-season finale of this deeply silly, surprisingly sincere comedy finds Sam (Sam Richardson) on the brink of fatherhood — which means he thinks he has to quit the ad agency he co-founded and find more reliable work. His BFF and business partner, Tim (Tim Robinson), of course feels crushed and betrayed. “Detroiters” is refreshingly earnest, and in an era of cerebral but quietly depressing comedies, it’s a welcome change of pace to have a show so gleeful. It hasn’t been renewed yet for a third season, so cross your fingers.
This trilogy comprises three 90-minute TV movies whose first installment aired on BBC in 2011, with two more airing in 2014. (They also made their way to PBS.) Bill Nighy stars as Johnny Worricker, an MI5 spy not always sure of his place in the modern political world. The bigger draw than the plot, though, is the cast: Rachel Weisz, Judy Davis, Winona Ryder, Christopher Walken, Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes, Felicity Jones, Michael Gambon and truly dozens of other dazzling performers build out the show’s weary, sometimes dangerous world. If you prize dialogue over action in your political thrillers, try this.
