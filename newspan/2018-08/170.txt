The grant notice was posted in July, and the program is being overseen by the department’s Science and Technology Directorate and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Independent school districts and nonprofit organizations are among the groups eligible for the grant, and they have until Aug. 27 to apply.
The development of the program could take about 36 months once a proposal is selected, John Verrico, a spokesman for the Science and Technology Directorate, said in an interview on Monday. He said it was too early to say how the program would be rolled out and expanded to the rest of the country.
The grant to develop a program is not tied to any one school shooting, but comes at a time when there have been more than 250 deaths of students and teachers in the country’s schools since 2000, according to Homeland Security. The bleeding-control program is also meant to address providing immediate help during natural disasters, Mr. Verrico said.
The grant, initially reported on Monday by The Young Turks, an online news show, is being publicized as states continue to struggle to address school shootings. This month, schools in Florida will be welcoming students back with more armed guards, fortified fences and heightened security, six months after one of the deadliest school shootings, in Parkland, Fla.
Some states allow districts to arm teachers and staff members, and active-shooter drills have become routine for administrators. In Illinois, firearms are prohibited on school campuses, but businesses have offered free concealed-carry courses to teachers.
Homeland Security asks that proposals include training on medical triage and mass casualty survival techniques, according to a statement of objectives.
The program would complement other resources that promote bleeding-control techniques.
“We’re trying to empower people to be that immediate responder and take action,” she said.
