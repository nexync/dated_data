Tracy Morgan, Conan O’Brien and Gabriel Iglesias are among the performers at the 15th annual New York Comedy Festival in November.
The festival will present more than 200 comedians in prominent venues across the city like Madison Square Garden, Carolines on Broadway and Town Hall. Bill Burr will get the biggest stage, performing at the Garden on Nov. 7. Mr. O’Brien will arrive at the Beacon Theater the day after, presenting an event called “Conan and Friends: An Evening of Stand-Up and Investment Tips,” as part of a larger tour.
Nov. 10 is particularly busy: Comedy lovers will have to choose between Mr. Morgan and Marc Maron at the Beacon Theater, Jim Jefferies at Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden, David Cross (“Arrested Development”) at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Yvonne Orji (“Insecure”) at Carolines on Broadway, or the “Queer Eye” stars Jonathan Van Ness and Antoni Porowski — who will host a stand-up variety show featuring all gay comedians — at Town Hall.
So far, few women are on the lineup. In addition to Ms. Orji, the only other woman listed in the initial announcement is Erin Gibson, who will tape a live episode of her podcast, “Throwing Shade,” at BMCC Tribeca Performing Arts Center on Nov. 9.
And Desus Nice and the Kid Mero, who will soon lead a late-night show on Showtime after a stint at Viceland, will take the stage of the Hulu Theater on Nov. 11.
The festival is produced in partnership with TBS. Tickets go on sale Aug. 13 at www.nycomedyfestival.com.
