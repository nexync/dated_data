The American Folk Art Museum announced Wednesday that Jason T. Busch will take over as its executive director in September, replacing Anne-Imelda Radice, who stepped down in March after nearly six years with the institution.
Folk art, he said, “can help to democratize art and celebrate art from individuals who didn’t have formal training.” The museum displays more than 8,000 such pieces, from traditional folk art to newer works by self-taught artists.
He comes to the museum from his position as director of the Jason Jacques Gallery in Manhattan. In addition, he has been deputy director of the Saint Louis Art Museum and said that he helped to curate the folk art collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Art. He is a former division director for decorative arts at Sotheby’s and has worked as a curator at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford and the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. Mr. Busch is an academic member of the Folk Art Society of America.
“I feel that it’s a real privilege to join the museum at this momentous moment,” Mr. Busch said.
He will continue the work of Dr. Radice, who retired in March after a long stretch of working to revive the once-troubled museum. Before she was appointed in 2012, the museum had sold off most of its gallery spaces and had even debated distributing its pieces to other museums. She started digitizing the collection and balanced the museum’s budget. The museum will celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2021.
Since Dr. Radice’s retirement, Stacy C. Hollander served as interim executive director.
