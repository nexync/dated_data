Ronald Acuna Jr. led off with his first big-league triple and reached base three times, Johan Camargo hit a two-run double in a three-run third inning, and the Atlanta Braves beat the Mets, 4-2, on Thursday night, extending their winning streak to four.
The Mets dropped a season-low 18 games under .500 at 44-62. They have lost 41 of their last 60 games over all and 23 of their last 32 home games.
Todd Frazier returned from a rib cage injury and went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts in his first game since July 8. He was booed when he hit an inning-ending pop-up in the sixth that stranded Michael Conforto on third.
Acuna is hitting .357 (15 for 42) since being moved to the leadoff spot on July 20. He grounded inside the third-base bag and down the line on the night’s third pitch, and when Conforto struggled to find the ball, Acuna sped to third and slid in headfirst as his helmet came off. He scored when Ozzie Albies followed with a single.
Making his second big-league start in center, Acuna threw out Wilmer Flores as he was trying to stretch a single into a double in the sixth. Flores was initially called safe by the second-base umpire Gary Cederstrom, but the call was overturned in a video review.
Brando Nimmo hit his career-high 14th homer leading off the bottom half, and Freddie Freeman hit a go-ahead single in the third as Atlanta took a 4-1 lead. Freeman is hitting .400 (20 for 50) against the Mets this season.
Jesse Biddle pitched a perfect seventh, and Brad Brach struck out Conforto with a runner on second to end the eighth. A. J. Minter worked around a leadoff walk to Flores to remain perfect in seven save chances.
