The leader of the United Nations said on Wednesday that he had picked Michelle Bachelet, a prominent women’s rights advocate and the first woman to serve as Chile’s president, to be the organization’s next top human rights official.
The announcement by Secretary General António Guterres ended the uncertainty over who would replace Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, a Jordanian prince and longtime diplomat who became one of the most forthright critics of abuses by governments in many countries, including the United States, during his four years as the high commissioner for human rights.
Efforts to reach Ms. Bachelet in Chile were not immediately successful.
In conversations with journalists in recent days, Mr. al-Hussein spoke of the pressures he felt as an outspoken critic of repressive world leaders. He said Mr. Guterres had from time to time asked if he could have chosen less provocative language, but did not insist that the high commissioner change his words. “I saw it as advice from a friend,” Mr. al-Hussein said.
In an interview on Friday with the New York Times editorial board, Mr. al-Hussein said it should be part of the position’s responsibilities to be outspoken regardless of who is offended. “I don’t see how you can do the job otherwise,” he said.
