The Trump administration has used some unusual phrases to defend its positions in the news media. Here is a closer look at a few of these remarks.
First, the facts were alternative, Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to President Trump, suggested last year.
And now, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, said “Truth isn’t truth,” adding his own phrase to memorable — and sometimes head-scratching — comments made by those close to the president.
During an interview on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” the show’s host, Chuck Todd, asked Mr. Giuliani about Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, who The New York Times reported was cooperating extensively in the special counsel investigation.
Mr. Todd asked how Mr. Giuliani had responded to requests by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to interview Mr. Trump and whether Mr. Giuliani had delayed the investigation.
Mr. Giuliani was alluding to a statement he made on CNN this month that the president never spoke with James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, about ending an investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the fired national security adviser, thus contradicting Mr. Comey.
Mr. Giuliani’s phrase that “truth isn’t truth” joins Ms. Conway’s assertion in January 2017 that the White House had put forth “alternative facts” to ones reported by the news media about the size of Mr. Trump’s inauguration crowd.
