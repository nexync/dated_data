A Connecticut man was sentenced on Wednesday to eight months in prison for his part in a hacking scandal in which nude photographs of the actress Jennifer Lawrence and other celebrities were made public on the internet, according to the man’s lawyer.
The man, George Garofano, 26, had pleaded guilty in April to gaining access to about 240 Apple iCloud accounts and stealing users’ private information. He was one of four hackers involved in a 2014 phishing scheme that tricked people into revealing their usernames and passwords. The other three hackers have been sentenced.
Mr. Garofano’s lawyer, Richard Lynch, said that Judge Victor A. Bolden, who oversaw sentencing in the United States District Court in Bridgeport, Conn., gave his client a lighter sentence than prosecutors had requested. Prosecutors in the case had argued that Mr. Garofano should serve at least 10 to 16 months in prison, saying the hacking was a serious crime.
After Mr. Garofano serves his sentence, he will be subject to three years of supervised release.
Mr. Garofano, who is from North Branford, Conn., breached not only the accounts of celebrities like Ms. Lawrence, Kate Upton and Kirsten Dunst, but also those of users who were not famous. Ms. Lawrence told Vanity Fair in 2014 that she was worried about how the release of the stolen photos would affect her career.
A spokeswoman for Ms. Lawrence said on Thursday that the actress declined to comment on the sentencing news.
Mr. Lynch said his client was apologetic. “When he gets behind a computer, he forgets what he does impacts other people,” he said.
