On the cover of this week’s Book Review, Daniel Mendelsohn writes at length about not just David Mitchell’s new novel, “Utopia Avenue,” but the entire career of the author of “Ghostwritten,” “Cloud Atlas” and other books. On the podcast, Mendelsohn discusses Mitchell and his work, and some larger ideas about the nature of a literary career.
Maria Konnikova visits the podcast to talk about her new book, “The Biggest Bluff,” in which she recounts her unlikely entry into — and then success in — the world of high-stakes poker, and what the game can tell us about our emotional relationship to risk.
