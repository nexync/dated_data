The House speaker was connected with a conspiracy to enact a $1.3 billion bailout of an energy company, the F.B.I. said.
The conspiracy was “likely the largest bribery, money-laundering scheme ever perpetrated against the people of the state of Ohio,” the United States attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, David M. DeVillers, said in a news conference.Though the criminal complaint did not name the energy company, the two nuclear power plants were owned by FirstEnergy Solutions, a former subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp.
FirstEnergy Solutions is now known as Energy Harbor, a separate corporate entity from FirstEnergy Corp. Energy Harbor owns the two nuclear plants that Mr. Householder helped bail out, according to the Energy and Policy Institute. The institute said that the criminal complaint indicates that three entities — FirstEnergy Corp., FirstEnergy Solutions and FirstEnergy Service Co., another subsidiary of FirstEnergy Corp. — together provided the $60 million for the scheme.
FirstEnergy Corp. said in a statement on Tuesday that it had received subpoenas “in connection with the investigation surrounding Ohio House Bill 6,” and intended to cooperate with investigators. Energy Harbor said they are reviewing the complaint and will cooperate with the investigation.
The speaker, a mainstay of Ohio politics who is up for re-election this year, previously served as House speaker until 2004, when he reached term limits amid reports of possible corruption, the complaint said. He was never charged, however, and successfully reclaimed his old seat in 2016 before being elected speaker in 2019.
