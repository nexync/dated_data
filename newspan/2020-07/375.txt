The utility, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, is upgrading power lines, trimming trees and making other changes to prevent another big fire.
One site we visited was a wooden electrical pole along the scenic Silverado Trail, at the foot of a dry mountain and in the shadow of dead and dying trees. Our guides noted that a crew installed the switch on the pole just two weeks earlier. The device will allow PG&Eâ€™s employees working in a distant control center to cut electricity to the immediate area while maintaining power along other segments of the power line. That will help the company be more surgical about cutting off power than it was last year when it blacked out millions of people for days on end when fire danger was high.
