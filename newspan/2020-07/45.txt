A new documentary series follows Amy Schumer during a busy pregnancy. And a weird romantic comedy hits Hulu.
EXPECTING AMY Stream on HBO Max. In March of last year, the comedian Amy Schumer released a stand-up special, “Growing,” that was filmed while Schumer was pregnant. Making it, Schumer said, was the most difficult challenge of her career. “I’m ecstatic and furious,” she told The New York Times shortly before the special’s release. “And pleased and peaceful and manic and hopeless and so hopeful it’s crazy.” So viewers can expect both highs and lows in this new, three-part documentary, which follows Schumer during her pregnancy. “Expecting Amy” is woven together primarily from cellphone video footage (Alexander Hammer, who worked on Beyoncé’s “Homecoming,” is the director and editor), which adds to the intimacy.
THE NEW YORK TIMES PRESENTS 10 p.m. on FX. This new documentary series from the team behind “The Weekly” will present hourlong documentaries monthly. The first entry, which will debut on Friday night, follows medical workers in New York City during an extraordinary time: This year, as workers fight to keep the city’s health care system running during the coronavirus crisis.
