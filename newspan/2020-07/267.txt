After suing the C.D.C., The Times obtained a database with the characteristics of 1.5 million individuals who tested positive for the virus through the end of May. The data showed that people who were Black or Latino were three times as likely to become infected as people who were white.
The data provided only part of the picture, though, when it came to Native Americans because of gaps in the data: It included geographic information and racial classifications for just 974 of the 3,143 counties in the nation, and did not include some of the places where Native American people make up large parts of the population.
