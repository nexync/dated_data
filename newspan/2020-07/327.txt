It’s the second study in a week to report promising results in monkeys for a vaccine candidate. But the real test will come with human trials that are now underway.
In March, Dr. Barouch and his colleagues designed seven variants of an Ad26 vaccine for the coronavirus. They made tiny changes to the spike gene to see whether they could get cells to make more copies of the viral protein. They also tested variants that would make the spike protein more stable, which might prompt a stronger immune response.
Based on earlier research, Dr. Barouch and his colleagues suspected that the Ad26 vaccine would be very potent. They decided to run their experiment using just one dose, to see whether that was enough to provide immunity.
The company plans on testing both single and double doses. Dr. Rasmussen said that a vaccine that proved effective with a single dose would make it far easier to treat the billions of people who need it. “Theoretically, you would need less of it, so you give it to more people more quickly,” she said.
 Their report has not yet been published in a scientific journal.
AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford have developed a vaccine based on yet another type of modified virus, called ChAdOx1. In May, they released promising monkey data, which was also published on Thursday in Nature. The team is now running Phase 3 trials in people, which could produce results by October.
“It’s exciting to see the number of platforms that are showing promise for a vaccine,” said Stacey L. Schultz-Cherry, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis who was not involved in any of the trials.
