Democrats and activists who have long sought to update the Voting Rights Act say the proper way to honor the fallen civil rights icon is to pass it and name it in his honor. Republicans are opposed.
Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, told reporters on Tuesday that House leaders hoped to have a bill together by the end of the week combining a fix to the Voting Rights Act with new funds to support local election officials and make balloting more accessible.
The House has already passed similar provisions individually, but the idea would be to unite them in a single measure named for Mr. Lewis.
“There can be no greater tribute to John Lewis than having a bill passed that protects and affirms the right for which he worked all his life,” Mr. Hoyer said.
