WARSAW — Poland’s presidential election, widely viewed as the most important since the end of Communist rule in 1989, failed to produce a clear winner on Sunday night, though final exit polls showed President Andrzej Duda leading the challenger, Rafal Trzaskowski.
Mr. Duda, a conservative nationalist, had 51 percent of the votes to 49 percent for Mr. Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, according to the polls, but they are not considered official results and neither candidate conceded the race. That set the stage for an extended fight over the results of Europe’s first presidential election since the coronavirus swept across the continent.
Over the past two weeks, an already bitter contest turned even darker, as Mr. Duda’s campaign leaned heavily on stoking fear of gay people and the free press, and began making arguments tinged with anti-Semitism.
