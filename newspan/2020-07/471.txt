MONDAY PUZZLE — One of the first social niceties we learn as children, perhaps even before “please” and “thank you,” is to greet people (“Say hello to Aunt Bertha!”).
Alan Arbesfeld greets us today, and I think it’s a lovely way to start our solving week.
Mr. Arbesfeld offers us six theme entries that all begin with the “hi” sound, but each “hi” is spelled in a different way.
