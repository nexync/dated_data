State agriculture officials are urging residents not to plant the seeds, which were mailed in pouches featuring Chinese characters.
Officials in at least 27 states are urging residents to report any unsolicited packages of seeds that appear to have been sent from China, warning that they might be invasive or otherwise harmful.
The agriculture departments in those states have issued statements in recent days, noting that residents had reported receiving packages of seeds in the mail that they had not ordered.
The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry reported that some of the packages were labeled to say they contained earbuds or toys.
Public notices about unsolicited shipments of seeds from China were also issued by agriculture officials in Washington State, Virginia, Kentucky, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, Florida, and Alabama.
Packages of seeds have also been sent to residents in Utah and Arizona, according to local news reports. The agriculture departments in at least four other states — Arkansas, Michigan, New Jersey and Oregon — issued warnings but did not say whether any of their residents had reported receiving seeds in the mail.
