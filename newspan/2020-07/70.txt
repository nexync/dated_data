The natural gas project would have crossed the Appalachian Trail. Dominion Energy, one of the pipeline’s two partners, also announced the sale of its gas transmission and storage assets.
The two energy companies won a victory just last month in the Supreme Court over a permit from the U.S. Forest Service, but said that “recent developments have created an unacceptable layer of uncertainty and anticipated delays” for the pipeline. They cited the potential for further legal challenges.
Dominion, which is based in Richmond, Va., provides electricity and natural gas to more than seven million customers across 20 states. Berkshire Hathaway Energy’s operations include a portfolio of more than $100 billion in assets and provide service to 12 million electric and natural gas users.
