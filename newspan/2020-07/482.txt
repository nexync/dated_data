Health|The Pandemic’s Big Mystery: How Deadly Is the Coronavirus?
Even with more than 500,000 dead worldwide, scientists are struggling to learn how often the virus kills. Here’s why.
Amid a surge in cases, India plans to reopen cinemas, entertainment parks and some schools.
Fans celebrate the Stanley Cup champions, well outside the N.H.L.’s pandemic bubble.

The C.D.C. relies on a “symptomatic case fatality ratio” that “is not necessarily equivalent to the number of reported deaths per reported cases.” The best estimate for the United States is 0.4 percent, according to a set of planning scenarios released in late May.
The agency did not respond to requests to explain how it arrived at that figure, or why it was so much lower than the W.H.O.’s estimate. By comparison, 0.4 percent of the United States population is 1.3 million people.
