Data from antibody tests in 10 different cities and states indicate that many people with no symptoms may be spreading the virus.
The researchers analyzed blood samples from people who had routine clinical tests or were hospitalized to determine if they had antibodies to the coronavirus — evidence of prior infection. They had released early data from six cities and states in June. The study published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal on Tuesday expands that research by including four more regions. They also posted data from later time periods for eight of those 10 sites to the C.D.C.’s website on Tuesday.
