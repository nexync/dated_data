The new additions are from the series that is on display on the museum’s Fifth Avenue facade.
The series of bronze statues by Wangechi Mutu that currently adorns the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s facade is scheduled to be on public display until early November. But two of the four pieces, “The Seated I” and “The Seated III,” will remain at the museum long after the exhibition closes as a part of its collections, the Met announced on Tuesday.
When they were unveiled last September, Ms. Mutu’s caryatid sculptures — traditionally female figures carved into architectural support structures like columns — were the first artworks to be presented from the face of the Met’s building on Fifth Avenue. In Ms. Mutu’s renderings, the figures are released from their supporting role. 
Their style also separates them from the typical caryatids that visitors might see elsewhere. “With sloping eyes and long fingers expressive of exceptional reach, they speak as messengers from an Afrofuturist-inflected otherworld,” Nancy Princenthal wrote in the Times.
The series, collectively titled “The NewOnes, will free Us,” was commissioned by the Met, along with paintings by Kent Monkman. These efforts, and the acquisition of Ms. Mutu’s sculptures, are part of a larger push by the museum to increase its engagement with contemporary art.
Carol Bove, a sculptor known for large-scale works that combine modernist and minimalist elements, will be the next artist to tackle the Met’s frontispiece. Mr. Hollein anticipates that her installation, originally scheduled to debut in September, will be exhibited in 2021.
