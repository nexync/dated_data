New technologies, like the gene-editing tool Crispr, can spot the virus in less than an hour. But it will likely be months before these tests hit clinics.
The test cooked up by Columbia University’s Dr. Williams and his colleagues might be simpler still: Spit is added to a premixed slew of chemicals, which then gets incubated at 145 degrees Fahrenheit for half an hour. If the tube turns yellow, the test is positive; if it’s red, negative. The test can detect even tiny amounts of virus, making it more sensitive than similar tests, and gives false negatives less than 5 percent of the time, according to a study that has not yet been published in a scientific journal. Dr. Williams and his team are seeking authorization from the F.D.A.
