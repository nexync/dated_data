The agents’ conditions were among several virus-related factors that led the vice president to change his plans for a visit on Tuesday.
WASHINGTON — Vice President Mike Pence postponed a planned trip this week to Arizona after Secret Service agents set to travel with him tested positive for the coronavirus or showed symptoms, two administration officials said on Thursday.
But the positive tests and symptoms of Secret Service agents expected to be in proximity to the man who is next in line for the presidency were some of the factors that prompted his change of schedule, the officials said. The news of the agents who showed symptoms of Covid-19, or tested positive, was first reported by The Washington Post.
Still, the latest illnesses among the small circle of individuals who interact directly with the vice president were a reminder of the dangers of carrying on with campaign and official government travel as the pandemic rages on.
At least eight campaign staff members who helped plan President Trump’s indoor rally last month in Tulsa, Okla., have tested positive for the virus, either before the rally or after attending, the campaign said. On Thursday, after Herman Cain, a former presidential candidate who had been at the president’s rally in Tulsa, said he had been hospitalized for the coronavirus, a Trump campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, made it clear that Mr. Cain had not seen the president in person while at the event. “Mr. Cain did not meet with the president,” Mr. Murtaugh said.
In May, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pence, tested positive for the coronavirus, as did a military aide to Mr. Trump.
The president, however, has continued to promote an optimistic message that the worst of the pandemic has passed, even as he has suspended planned campaign events and aides who have worked the ones he has staged have fallen ill.
