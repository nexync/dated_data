Ahead of a major retrospective in Los Angeles, the Japanese artist discusses his musical education.
As he collected records (his first single in English was 1967’s “Massachusetts,” by the Bee Gees), he scrutinized the album jackets, which he considered wondrous artworks. He adored the cover of Joni Mitchell’s “Song to a Seagull” (1968), which he was pleased to learn she’d painted herself, and how the jacket of Luke Gibson’s “Another Perfect Day” (1971) appeared to be embroidered with wildflowers. These combinations of sounds and visuals trained Nara’s imagination and foreshadowed the time when, as a grown man and cultural figure in his own right, he’d provide cover art for bands including Shonen Knife, R.E.M. and Bloodthirsty Butchers.
