The procedure, to “revise a bile duct stent,” was performed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. “According to her doctors, stent revisions are common occurrences and the procedure, performed using endoscopy and medical imaging guidance, was done to minimize the risk of future infection,” the spokeswoman, Kathleen Arberg, said in a statement.
“The justice is resting comfortably and expects to be released from the hospital by the end of the week,” Ms. Arberg said.
Justice Ginsburg, who is 87 and the senior member of the court’s liberal wing, has been hospitalized several times in recent months. In May, she participated in oral arguments from her hospital room at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, where she was being treated for a gallbladder condition.
In July, she was treated for a possible infection at the same hospital after experiencing chills and a fever, and she underwent an endoscopic procedure to clean out the bile duct stent.
In her recent announcement, issued July 17, she said the recurrence of her cancer was discovered after a biopsy in February that revealed lesions on her liver.
The discovery of liver cancer was only her most recent medical issue. She has had surgery for lung cancer and radiation treatment for pancreatic cancer in recent years. She has also had surgery for early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009 and treatment for colon cancer in 1999.
Were Justice Ginsburg to leave the court, President Trump would have the opportunity to name a third justice, and Senate Republicans have promised to try to fill the vacancy even in the waning days of his first term.
She has vowed to stay on the court so long as she can perform her duties.
