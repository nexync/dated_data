Theater|The ‘Wildcat’ Episode, or, Did Broadway Love Lucy?
The big question, posed in The New York Times on Dec. 11, 1960.
Another night, her character asked a supporting player, “Say, do you know a fellow named Fred Mertz?” The joke got a laugh (Mertz being the name of her “I Love Lucy" neighbor), but made no sense: Who in the play’s 1912 Texas border town would know Mertz, and why would she ask? Ball was also given to holding up her hand to the audience when she lost her place in the dialogue or lyrics, and would start over.
