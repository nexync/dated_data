On July 5, he performed a similar operation on a second Covid patient, Brian Kuhns, 62, from Lake Zurich, Ill.
Mr. Kuhns spent 100 days on life-support machines before receiving the transplant. Before becoming ill, he had thought Covid was a hoax, his wife, Nancy Kuhns, said, in a statement issued by the hospital.
Two more patients at Northwestern are awaiting transplants, one from Chicago and one from Washington, D.C., said Dr. Bharat, who is the chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director of the lung transplant program.
Last Friday, a Covid patient transferred from another state underwent a double lung transplant at the University of Florida Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Dr. Tiago Machuca said.
Because the extensive lung damage in Covid patients makes transplant surgery especially difficult, most patients would be referred to major transplant centers that are best equipped to perform the risky operations and provide the intensive aftercare that patients need, the surgeons said. Mr. Kuhns was transferred to Northwestern from another health system.
