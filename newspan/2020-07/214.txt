An article on Wednesday about similarities between the public personas of President Trump and his father described incorrectly the illness that afflicted Donald Trump’s mother when he was two and a half years old. The illness she suffered from, peritonitis, is an inflammation of the peritoneum, a tissue lining the abdominal cavity, not the stomach lining.
A picture caption with an article on July 4 about the use of deepfakes in a documentary, based on information from a publicist, misidentified a volunteer whose face was used to cloak one of the documentary’s subjects. He is Miguel Grisanti, not Matias Alvial.
A headline with an article last Thursday about the decline of Brooks Brothers referred imprecisely to Lisa Birnbach’s contribution to “The Official Preppy Handbook.” She was the book’s editor and an author, not its sole author.
An obituary on Friday about Tony Elliott, the founder of the Time Out global publishing empire, misspelled the name of the town in England where he was born. It is Reading, not Redding.
An obituary on July 4 about the marijuana scholar Lester Grinspoon misstated the year that the movie “Reefer Madness,” originally known as “Tell Your Children,” was released. It was either 1938 or 1939 — not, despite what many sources say, 1936.
