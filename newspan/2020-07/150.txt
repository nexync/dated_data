Donald Trump’s father, Fred, never cared for Mary Trump’s mother, Linda, a former flight attendant from Florida whom he considered a gold digger. He turned a blind eye when his eldest son was sick and living with his young family in a frigid Trump-owned apartment with plastic sheeting over its rotting walls. Years later, after his son died, Fred would disinherit Mary and her brother; their uncle, Robert (of the toy trucks), explained: “Your grandfather didn’t want you or Fritz, or especially your mother, to get anything.” When the siblings threatened to sue for 20 percent of their grandfather’s estate, the family cut off the medical insurance that had been provided by Trump Management since they were born. “My brother depended upon this insurance to pay for my nephew’s crushing medical expenses,” Mary Trump writes. “William was out of the hospital by then, but he was still susceptible to seizures, which more than once had put him in a state of cardiac arrest so severe that he would not have survived without CPR. He still required round-the-clock nursing care.” The response from the lawyer representing Fred Trump’s estate: William’s parents should learn CPR.
