The move by the 204-year-old Remington Arms Company came after years of litigation and declining sales.
On Tuesday, the Sandy Hook families released a statement expressing concern that Remington would use the bankruptcy process to escape any potential financial liability stemming from their lawsuit.
“Nearly eight years after my sweet little Daniel, along with six adult educators and 19 other first graders, were murdered in their classrooms, Remington must not be permitted to use its bankruptcy filing to dodge responsibility,” said Mark Barden, whose son was killed in the shooting.
