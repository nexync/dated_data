St. Frances de Chantal in the Bronx, Francis M.’s childhood church.
I was a writer at The Washington Post at the time, and I began working on the McCarrick story. I knocked on the door of the archdiocesan house he had retreated to, and I requested interviews through his legal team but received no answer from him. I was frustrated by the church’s reticence regarding Mr. McCarrick’s career of abuse and disturbed by my increasing difficulty producing an answer when asked by friends why I was still Catholic.
Francis M. has searched for solace and meaning in liturgy.
