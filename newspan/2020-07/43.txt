It’s probably no coincidence that the same subjects we’re taught to avoid in polite conversation — politics, religion, money — are so irresistible to read about. We’ll save religion for another time, but this week we invite you to think about money by way of Stefano Massini’s epic novel of the Lehman Brothers company, and about politics by way of the other books we recommend, from Robert M. Gates’s treatise on foreign policy to DW Gibson’s tour of President Trump’s border wall. We won’t even discourage you from discussing them, politely, when you’re done.
