On Friday evening, Chinese state television reported that the Hong Kong police had issued warrants for the arrests of six democracy advocates who are now overseas. They are wanted on charges of promoting secession and colluding with foreign forces, according to the report — crimes that are punishable with life imprisonment under the security law. The police declined to comment.
One of the six, Samuel Chu, said on Twitter that he had been an American citizen for 25 years.
Also on Friday, Hong Kong’s secretary for justice said that David Leung, the city’s British-trained director of prosecutions, had submitted his resignation. Pro-Beijing politicians and the police had accused Mr. Leung of being too cautious about bringing charges against protesters, though he had prosecuted some high-profile activists. Mr. Leung did not issue a statement.
The spirit of the security law has been used to justify the dismissal of the professor at the University of Hong Kong, Benny Tai. After the rollout of the rules, Mr. Tai, who was convicted of public nuisance for his role in protests in 2014, helped organize the recent primary vote for the pro-democracy camp.
Beijing’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong supported his removal, describing it in a statement as “a just act of punishing evil and promoting good and conforming to the people’s will.” The security law was also invoked this week for the disqualifications of candidates for the legislature.
The government also said it was unconstitutional to vow to block its legislative proposals in order to pressure the administration. Some opposition lawmakers had floated the idea of voting down the government’s budget. Under Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, that could force the resignation of the chief executive, Carrie Lam, and new elections.
