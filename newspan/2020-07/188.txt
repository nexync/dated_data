A few days before Los Angeles announced a shelter-in-place order in March, Colson Baker, who raps under the name Machine Gun Kelly, sat down on a sofa with an acoustic guitar. His tattoos peeked through a white tank top. Tousled blond hair poked out of a Cleveland Cavaliers cap.
“I’m surprised I’m awake, too,” he said.
Mr. Baker had another surprise in store. Accompanied by a bandmate, he tore into a giddy instrumental cover of Paramore’s “Misery Business,” a song in which a teenage girl brags about the boy she stole. Then he uploaded the video to Instagram — caption: #LockdownSessions Day 1 — where it ran up more than 1.2 million views.
Mr. Baker, 30, is better known for pop-rap song like “Rap Devil,” a 2018 diss track aimed at Eminem (sample lyrics: “I’m sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats”) and “Hollywood Whore,” a post-fame song that bites the record industry hand feeding him.
His music, however, is sometimes overshadowed by his tabloid antics, like the time he smoked a joint with Pete Davidson at the Golden Globes, as well as his string of famous girlfriends: both real (Amber Rose, Sommer Ray) and rumored (Halsey, Noah Cyrus).
And his albums compete with a flourishing film career, including, most recently, Mr. Davidson’s “The King of Staten Island.” An unlikely fashion darling — angel-blond hair, bedroom-eyed, 6’4” in socks — he has modeled for John Varvatos and been dressed by Berluti and Balmain.
But in lockdown, with film sets closed and a wardrobe devoted to dirtbag chic, attention has returned to his music. Well, his music and his much-discussed possible relationship with the actress Megan Fox.
In addition to the Paramore post, Mr. Baker has performed impromptu covers of Oasis, Rihanna and John Mayer. The songs — a miscellany of pop, rap, oldies, newbies — are about as hard-core as a squeeze toy.
Filmed on an iPhone in his six-bedroom, Spanish-style house in the San Fernando Valley, the videos make up for what they lack in innovation and polish with antic energy and marijuana-laced intimacy. The #LockdownSessions have drawn as many as 26 million views for each post (there have been about 20) and have cracked YouTube’s Top 10 Songs of the Week.
His label has told him that these off-the-sweatshirt-cuff posts have attracted more online engagement than any of his professionally shot and edited videos. Instead of calling him a fake, a softy, a poser — the occupational hazards of white rappers, perhaps — fans have responded with countless ❤️ and 🔥emojis, and pleas to upload the songs onto Spotify.
That split between Colson Baker, introspective stoner, and Machine Gun Kelly, rap devil, surfaced in early March, when Mr. Baker spent a few nights in New York City promoting “Big Time Adolescence,” a movie starring Mr. Davidson, in which he has a supporting role.
A few hours before a flight to Cleveland to see his 10-year-old daughter’s volleyball game, he detoured to La Biblioteca, an underground tequila bar near Grand Central Terminal, for a mezcal tasting. “I’m just high and in a vibe,” he told the bartender.
He wore a leather trench coat, leather pants, a shredded tank — the outfit of a high-fashion outlaw. With a tangle of chains gripping his throat and pearls spilling from a pocket, he looked like a rangy choir boy gone very bad.
On the drive over, he had smoked a cannoli-sized blunt. At the bar he sipped his way through five shots of mezcal, one of them seasoned with a scorpion. Then he ordered a beer.
“Will they let you on the plane?” a publicist asked.
Leaning back into a banquette with his feet on the table, his eyes went sleepy and his voice slurred. He talked about his forthcoming album, “Tickets to My Downfall,” due out in July, which hurtles away from rap and toward pop-punk, which he regarded as progress. “It took me 10 years to evolve into this sound,” he said.
He then talked about robots (“Dude, robots can’t feel and feeling is all we have left”) and dreams (“I don’t have dreams when I sleep, but when I wake up all I do is dream”). He also discussed his career, which he saw as a breathless sprint from single to single, persona to persona, film to film. He said he found it hard to take pleasure in his success.
“Is it everything I thought it’d be? It should be,” he said. But it wasn’t.
“People were like, ‘You have a name?’ And even I was like, ‘Yeah, weird, huh?,’” Mr. Baker said.
About two hours later, in a chauffeured S.U.V. parked on a residential side street a few blocks from La Guardia Airport, with the windows rolled up and another blunt the size of a baby’s arm in his hand, he wondered how long he could keep up with late nights and the hard partying, the driving too fast, the living like he wants to die.
“I’ll just be like controlled at 8 p.m. and then I’m out till 8 in the morning — what did I just do?” he said, with an added expletive.
The adults around him are also concerned. “You just want him to not fall off one of the many ledges he dances on the edge of, daily,” Mr. Crowe said.
At 11 — scrawny, bullied — Mr. Baker discovered rap and he worked at his beats and bars throughout his teens. “I was just always roaming, the hallways, rapping for everybody,” he said. He would tell his friends that he would one day appear on the biggest stages, that other people would sing his lyrics.
He played another jerk in the Netflix chiller “Birdbox,“ and appeared alongside Mr. Davidson in “The King of Staten Island,” and “Big Time Adolescence.” Last year, he co-starred in “The Dirt, a Mötley Crüe biopic in which he played Tommy Lee, mostly shirtless.
Is He Dating Megan Fox?
Mr. Baker turned 30 in quarantine. He usually celebrates with a Gatsby-esque event. This time he stayed in, mostly, and partied with his band.
His neighbor, Jeff Lewis, who starred in the renovation reality show, “Flipping Out,” complained that it was rowdier than just “chilling.” “There were at least 14 people in the driveway alone,” he said on his Sirius XM show.
One of those people might have included a former girlfriend, Ms. Ray, an Instagram and fitness model, who had chosen that day to stop by and pick up her stuff. Mr. Baker’s romantic life may not be as eventful as the tabloids suggest, but it’s eventful enough.
Is Mr. Baker dating Ms. Fox, who electrocutes him in “Bloody Valentine,” the first video from his next album. (They met while filming the upcoming crime thriller, “Midnight in the Switchgrass,” and she has reportedly left her husband, Brian Austin Green.) He wouldn’t say. But paparazzi photos and Twitter posts certainly suggest an intimate relationship.
In recent weeks, he has been vocal in his support for Black Lives Matter, holding up a “Silence Is Betrayal” sign at a Los Angeles protest, which he posted on Instagram; telling racist fans “I don’t want your business”; covering Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name,” a protest song about police brutality.
So is this the older, and mellower Machine Gun Kelly — a man who involves himself in politics, who apologizes to his neighbor with premium champagne?

 So instead of screaming, he sits on the floor, one knee, tattooed with a marijuana leaf peeking out from torn sweatpants, and plays electric guitar to Avril Lavigne’s star-crossed teen anthem “Sk8ter Boi,” headbanging as he slides up and down the frets.
Alongside millions of fans, his father watches.
A couple of weeks ago, he posted a new video, a compilation of fans making their own #LockdownSessions out of “Bloody Valentine,” using his lyrics as a soundtrack for their own passions and confusions in lockdown. “I’m trying to give people an outlet to smile during such dark times,” he said.
