Our chief classical critic took on the daunting Opus 110 in college, and now relishes risky recordings.
Serkin, who set the highest standards for himself, said in a 1969 interview that he “never had the courage” to perform a complete cycle of Beethoven sonatas. Then it was announced that in honor of the composer’s 200th, in 1970, he would play all 32 in a series of programs at Carnegie Hall. He wound up playing less than half of them in four concerts. I attended all four.
