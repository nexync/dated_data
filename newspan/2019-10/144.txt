Sure you could have drinks and dancing at your reception, or, you could have Connect 4, KerPlunk and cornhole competitions to get the party started.
Meredith and Andrew Shackleford didn’t want their wedding to have an ordinary cocktail hour. Instead of having their guests sip drinks and eat canapés, the couple divided everyone into six teams to compete in a series of games that included croquet, ladder ball, and blindfolded wine tastings. The winning team took home bottles of champagne and a trophy.
The Shacklefords, who are from Vancouver, British Columbia, and married in 2014, and own the wedding planning blog Love & Lavender, aren’t the only ones breaking away from traditional cocktail hour fare. In recent years, a number of rental companies have cropped up to meet this growing demand for wedding games that can be played both indoors and outdoors.
Erin Fogg and her mother, Elaine Mee, founded Power of Love Rentals in 2013 in Portland, Ore. They offer lawn games in addition to table linens, place settings and other wedding décor.
