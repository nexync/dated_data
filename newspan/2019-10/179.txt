Intimate but distant by design, Andy Bragen’s play takes us on a journey many are likely to face with an aging parent.
Fourth Street Theater, 83 E. Fourth St.
The title of Andy Bragen’s new autobiographical show, “Notes on My Mother’s Decline,” forecasts exactly what’s in store: It is just as collected, fatalistic and grief-stricken as you might expect. Perhaps those first two qualities, with their suggestion of emotional detachment, are what helped the playwright cope with the third. Or maybe that’s what Bragen (“This Is My Office,” “Don’t You _______ Say a Word”) would like us to think.
A man of impending middle age identified as Son (the longtime Wooster Group member Ari Fliakos) stands in a white bedroom (Marsha Ginsberg’s set gently suggests a transitional area between home, hospital and some kind of metaphysical limbo state).
The son, who is eventually referred to as Andy, is watching an older woman, Mother (Caroline Lagerfelt). She is dressed in a robe and nightgown and lying on a bed, propped up on pillows. Through most of the show, he describes his mother’s personality and routine in the present tense, as if providing a voice-over narration; Fliakos’s miking gives his voice a slightly disembodied quality.
Knud Adams directs this production for the Play Company and Andy Bragen Theater Projects, which is presented by Next Door at New York Theater Workshop. The audience sits on both sides of the stage, adding intimacy to the already small venue. At the same time, the text’s observational tone and Fliakos’s dispassionate delivery maintain a sense of distance, which can feel overprotective of both characters. We are with them, but at a remove, as if they were in a documentary.
It gets worse, and Bragen spares us few of the indignities of old age.  The show comes alive just as death enters.
