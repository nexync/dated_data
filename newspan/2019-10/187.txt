A firm that has been bidding for the struggling department store Barneys New York said on Thursday that its offer had been accepted, though no deal had been completed.
Barneys, which filed for bankruptcy in August, is holding out hope that a rival bid will come through in the next week, one that it said would preserve its stores and up to 2,000 jobs.
Authentic Brands Group, the owner of more than 50 brands including Nine West and Nautica, said in a statement that it was the successful bidder for Barneys’ intellectual property and outlined its plans to “evolve” the brand, including licensing the name to Saks Fifth Avenue for use in the United States and Canada. The company noted that the sale was contingent on approval from a bankruptcy court hearing next Thursday.
The release added to the tension between Authentic Brands, which is led by Jamie Salter, and a group of investors led by Sam Ben-Avraham, a co-founder of the streetwear brand Kith and the owner of a group of trade shows.
Mr. Ben-Avraham has been racing to put together a bid for Barneys, which he sees as a cultural institution and New York landmark that could evolve into a new experience, rather than license its name and liquidate its stores. He has created a “Save Barneys” campaign, including an @SaveBarneys Instagram account.
“We have until the 31st and are working around the clock, taking meetings, speaking on five phones, and we believe we will have a competitive bid and are the right party to take the Barneys brand forward,” he said.
Barneys lawyers acknowledged the “highly public” process in a court hearing on Thursday, and said that although the fashion retailer did not intend to do anything that would jeopardize the Authentic Brands bid, Mr. Ben-Avraham’s bid would keep all of the stores open and up to 2,000 people employed.
