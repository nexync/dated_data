WASHINGTON — An intelligence official with “firsthand knowledge” has provided information related to President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine and is now protected from retaliation as a whistle-blower, lawyers representing the official said on Sunday, confirming that a second individual has come forward in the matter.
Much is unknown about the official, who has been interviewed by the intelligence community’s inspector general but has not filed a formal complaint.
But the individual has hired the same legal team as the first whistle-blower. That, and the claim of “firsthand knowledge,” suggests testimony that might bolster the impeachment case against Mr. Trump and further undermine one of his main defense claims: that the accusations against him are based on inaccurate, secondhand information.
The New York Times reported on Friday that an intelligence official who has more direct knowledge of Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine than the first whistle-blower, and who had grown alarmed by the president’s behavior, was weighing whether to come forward. The second official was among those interviewed by the intelligence community inspector general to corroborate the allegations of the original whistle-blower, one of the people briefed on the matter said.
For Democratic lawmakers seeking to build their case for impeachment, the new whistle-blower could serve as an important witness for both validating what they know and potentially providing new leads for investigators. Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who is leading the House’s impeachment inquiry, urged other potential whistle-blowers to come forward on Sunday night.
One member of the legal team confirmed on Twitter that the firm was now representing “multiple whistleblowers” but declined to say how many. The inspector general has said that to corroborate the first whistle-blower’s complaint, he interviewed multiple people who would be afforded protections, and it was unclear if the lawyer could be referring to those people or other people.
Since the first whistle-blower emerged, the White House has tried to unmask his identity, and dismiss him as a “deep state operative” with partisan motives to “take down” Mr. Trump. The president stuck to form on Sunday evening in trying to dismiss the new whistle-blower.
House Democrats called their first witness in the impeachment inquiry, and he came with dozens of pages of text messages.
Today: The House Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry against President Trump have called their first witness — a U.S. diplomat involved in the negotiations with Ukraine. Julian Barnes on what that diplomat’s testimony revealed about where the inquiry is headed.
It’s Monday, October 7.
For the first time, today, lawmakers will hear from a diplomat directly involved in U.S. activities with Ukraine.
The first witness to testify, Kurt Volker, the now former U.S. special envoy for Ukraine.
Last Thursday, Kurt Volker walked into the House of Representatives and testified for nine hours.
Three committees are going to question Volker.
Volker is a very interesting figure. He is a longtime diplomat. He was ambassador to NATO in the Bush administration. And Volker was the special representative for Ukraine. He was the envoy in charge of trying to make progress in the fight between Russia and Ukraine — this ongoing war.
He’s a highly respected national security professional. He started his career at the CIA, was a foreign service officer. He was very close to John McCain and has run the McCain Institute.
He was mentioned several times in the whistle-blower’s complaint which sparked this inquiry.
— Volker is named in the whistle-blower complaint. And as the controversy over President Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart has exploded in Washington, Volker has found himself thrust into the center of it.
He is a top State Department envoy to Ukraine — at least he was, until he quit.
He resigned from his post. He resigned from his State Department job. And the reason he did that is, one, he was no longer going to be effective at trying to bring peace in Ukraine with all the questions. But it also allowed him to come before the House and testify candidly.
Here’s what’s interesting about it — Volker didn’t come just with the information in his head. He came with dozens of pages of text messages. And just hours after he finished his testimony, the House investigators released the most interesting ones.
Text messages released overnight linking a Ukrainian investigation into the Bidens in the 2016 election to a White House visit and maybe even military aid.
These texts take place between July and September — a pretty crucial period here. We’re going to hear from three main people.
One is Volker, special envoy to Ukraine.
With them, Gordon Sondland, a hotel owner and Republican donor appointed by President Trump to be U.S. ambassador to the European Union.
The other is Gordon Sondland.
Why would Sondland be involved in these communications? I mean, Ukraine isn’t even part of the E.U.
Well, he’s been quoted as saying, quote, “the president” asked him to get involved.
He is a friend of Trump and the American ambassador to the European Union.
And the other diplomat is Bill Taylor.
Bill Taylor is effectively running the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, since there is no permanent ambassador at this moment.
He’s the top diplomat in Ukraine, sent in, handpicked, by Kurt Volker to represent the United States there.
Those are the Trump administration officials. As a group, they all think of themselves as advocates for Ukraine. They’re trying, in their minds, to improve things in the country. They’re trying to do what’s best for Kiev.
The other person texting here is Andriy Yermak. He’s a top adviser to the Ukrainian president, Zelensky. And looming in the background throughout these conversations is Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer.
Stunning.  He said, it’s not complicated at all. It is the definition of complicated.
So let’s dive into these texts. Where should we start?
Well, we should start with the first one. It’s from July 19. Kurt Volker is writing to Rudy Giuliani. And he writes, “As discussed, connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.” And then we fast forward to later in the day, when Volker is texting with Gordon Sondland — remember, he is the E.U. ambassador. And Volker writes: “Had breakfast with Rudy this morning — teeing up call w Yermak Monday. ... Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help” with the investigation.
Well, that’s a reference to the two investigations that Mr. Trump is pushing for. One is an investigation into this company Burisma, where Hunter Biden, Joe Biden’s son, used to be a board member. And the other is this investigation that Trump wants into the 2016 election and Ukraine’s involvement.
So this is, based on the date, about six days before Trump will have a call with Zelensky. And Volker and Giuliani are having a conversation about communicating with the Ukraine president’s aide about how important it will be for Zelensky to say that he will do these investigations.
This establishes how critical those investigations were to Trump. That’s what that call on July 25 is. And so there’s all this flurry of organization, maneuvering, trying to get the Ukrainians to agree to it.
Before the call even happens.
O.K. So what’s the next text message that matters?
The alternative here is a Ukraine that’s cut off from the United States — that does not have a good relationship, and therefore is at the mercy of its larger, more aggressive neighbor, Russia.
So these three American diplomats, they are recognizing that Zelensky is being put in a bit of a difficult position.
That’s right. They realize that Trump and Giuliani are pushing for something — something that the Ukrainians may be reluctant to give. But several of these diplomats clearly think they need to persuade the Ukrainians if this relationship with Trump is going to get off the ground.
O.K. So take us to July 25 — to the moment of the call. What do these text messages tell us about that?
Right before the call, we see Volker, the envoy to Ukraine, talking to Yermak, the adviser to Zelensky. And Volker is setting up the call. He is kind of outlining what the Ukrainians need to do in it. He writes, “Assuming President Z convinces Trump he will investigate / ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down” a date for the “visit to Washington. Good luck!” And this shows us both what the Ukrainians want and what the Americans want. The Americans want this investigation that is critical to Donald Trump. And the Ukrainians want this public show of support, an invitation to the White House — a sign that America is still in Ukraine’s corner.
And it feels like those two things are contingent upon one another.
Reading this text message, it’s very clear that you’re only going to get the White House visit if you do the investigations and you say publicly you’re going to do the investigations.
So this is a kind of quid pro quo.
Very clearly. But it isn’t the big quid pro quo that people have been talking about. It’s not the one about military assistance. This is about a White House visit. But remember, that’s very important to the Ukrainians as well.
And why? Why is a White House visit so important to the Ukrainians that the Americans would understand it’s a point of leverage in seeking these investigations?
Look, Ukraine is in a very precarious place in this world. They are seeking closer ties to Europe, but they’re under huge pressure from Russia. They’re in a war with Russia. And having the United States put a friendly arm around Ukraine is very important to them. It is a sort of protection for them.
Right. And next, of course, the July 25 phone call between Zelensky and Trump happens. And Trump mentions all that the U.S. does for Ukraine, asks for a favor. And that favor is for Zelensky to begin investigating Ukraine’s connection to the 2016 election, and Joe Biden and his son. So what happens in this text traffic after that call?
So we hear from Yermak, the aide to the Ukrainian president. And he’s writing to Volker. And he has good news: The “phone call went well.” And Yermak starts to press for dates for this visit. And this is a clear sign that the Ukrainians are going to play ball, that they’re going to give Trump what he wants. And they’re expecting they’re going to get their White House visit in return.
Right. I’m looking at this passage. And Yermak is saying, by the way, President Zelensky chose September 20, 21 or 22. So, you know, just let us know.
And Volker responds: “Great — thanks and will do!” This is a sign that, at this moment in time, everything’s moving forward. White House has made an ask. Ukrainians think they’re going to get their White House visit in return.
So we can assume from this back and forth between Yermak and Volker that Zelensky has agreed on some level to conduct the investigations that Trump has asked for in the July 25 call and will get this White House visit in return.
That’s what it looks like from these text messages here.
But as we’re going to see, it’s going to get more complicated.
So from the Ukrainian point of view, things are going to move forward now. They want their White House meeting. And they have given President Trump what he wants. But what we’re going to see here is that it’s not quite enough. Trump and Giuliani want more. They want not just the private promise from Zelensky, but they want a public declaration that he’s going to do these investigations that are critical to Donald Trump.
Look, this tells us it’s not just enough to say a vague we’re going to investigate. But Trump and Giuliani want to see a real specific here. They want the Ukrainians to lay out exactly what they’re going to look into, and that’s the 2016 election and a company tied to the Biden family. This is an amazing amount of micromanaging for a foreign government, a sovereign government.
A key partner of the United States. And they are trying to get the government to say something very, very specific.
And does Zelensky’s administration issue such a statement?
I mean, this is kind of stunning, because here is as crystallized a version of this as perhaps you could ever imagine.
It’s transactional diplomacy at its bluntest. The Ukrainians want something. The U.S. wants something. But what’s different here is this is not usually what the American government asks its partners for. I mean, usually, you have the U.S. government saying, we want steps for you to fight corruption or to improve your business practices or improve how your military is run. Here, they’re asking for a political investigation that will benefit Donald Trump.
So the fact that these two countries are negotiating like this, that’s not the problem. It feels like, in some ways, this is what diplomacy is all about. It’s the content. It’s what is on the table here that is so unorthodox.
Absolutely. Countries, diplomats constantly do negotiations about what one side will do and what the other will do. But diplomacy is about negotiating for the national interest. And here, we have the Ukrainians negotiating for their national interest. And we have the Americans negotiating for the interests of Donald Trump.
And his re-election.
Yes, his re-election.
This is the distillation of a quid pro quo.
So the White House sending signals it wants to cut a significant military aid package to Ukraine.
And as these texts go on, it’s revealed what else is on the table.
Something that has critics questioning why the president appears to be favoring Moscow yet again.
After a news media report talking about the Ukraine aid being frozen.
That military aid that was passed into law by Congress. It’s the very same military aid for Ukraine that was supposed to help, quote, “keep Russia at bay.” And yet, Donald Trump has reportedly been slow-walking it all year.
Hmm. So right away, his suspicion is that there is now a second kind of quid pro quo in the mix here, which is military aid will be released if Zelensky agrees to do these investigations — no longer, as you said, just a White House visit.
That’s right. And you can tell that the other diplomats are a little bit uncomfortable talking about this quid pro quo so explicitly, because Sondland’s response to Taylor is a simple “call me.” And you see Bill Taylor outline what he says is his “nightmare scenario” — the scenario where the Ukrainians make a public commitment to do these investigations, but the U.S. still doesn’t release the military assistance. The consequences of that, he writes, is that the Russians would love it, and he would quit.
Meaning he would quit his job as a diplomat in protest of such an outcome.
Sondland responds as if he knows these text messages will someday be read by the whole world.
By us on a podcast.
This is the essence of the controversy. This is the essence of the impeachment inquiry that we’re in right now.
By the end of this text thread, Julian, it’s pretty clear that these three U.S. diplomats to varying degrees have become uncomfortable with just how much muck they stepped in. Yet they’ve all seemed to do their part in advancing the president’s desires.
That’s right. All three of these diplomats believe in the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship. They believe the U.S. can help Ukraine. But they’ve all decided that to make that happen, they’re going to help out Donald Trump. And that’s a compromise. That’s a decision they made that looks very questionable right now.
Is any of this that’s being discussed in these texts illegal?
It really doesn’t matter. Remember, impeachment is a political process. The question in an impeachment case is, did the president abuse his power? And so it doesn’t matter if there is a law broken. What matters is if the president bent the foreign policy of the United States for his own political benefit.
And if members of the House and Senate believe that he did that.
Where do these texts messages — what we have just learned from everything that was on Volker’s phone — where does that leave the impeachment process?
These text messages show the extent that the Trump administration was using the apparatus of government to advance its political goals. This wasn’t a one-off phone call. It was U.S. policy to pressure the Ukrainian government to lean on the new Ukrainian president to conduct an investigation that President Trump wanted for his political benefit. And for Democrats, these unguarded text messages between diplomats are the kind of evidence that allow them to bolster their case for impeachment. And it makes it harder for the president’s allies to defend him.
Thank you. Oh, dear.
You have to take the call?
O.K. I’ve got this call now.
Bye. [PICKS UP PHONE] Julian here.
Since Friday, the leaders of the House impeachment inquiry have widened their investigation, subpoenaing the White House for a trove of documents and requesting information from Vice President Mike Pence to better understand the administration’s campaign to pressure Ukraine for political favors.
So the Democrats — unfortunately, they have the votes. They could vote very easily, even though most of them, many of them don’t believe they should do it.
Speaking to reporters, President Trump acknowledged for the first time that Democrats in the House have enough votes to impeach him, but predicted that Republicans in the Senate would protect him from conviction and removal from office.
And then we’ll get it to the Senate. And we’re going to win. The Republicans have been very unified. This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country.
On Sunday, the lawyers for the whistle-blower whose complaint triggered the impeachment inquiry said that they were representing a second whistle-blower — an intelligence officer with firsthand knowledge of the president’s interactions with Ukraine. The existence of two whistle-blowers, both of whom were alarmed by Trump’s conduct, is expected to strengthen the Democrats’ case against the president.
Hello, everybody. We’re in Las Vegas. I just got out of the hospital a few hours ago. And I’m feeling so much better.
Senator Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign has acknowledged that he suffered a heart attack last week around the time he underwent a procedure to clear a blocked artery. For several days, the campaign had refused to answer questions about his condition. Speaking to reporters outside the hospital, Sanders said that the heart attack would not stop his campaign, and that he would appear on stage for the next Democratic debate on October 15.
I just want to thank all of you for the love and warm wishes that you sent to me. See you soon on the campaign trail.
The lawyers representing both whistle-blowers said the emergence of a second account should take the focus off the identities of the individuals coming forward.
“Our hope is that the focus will appropriately shift to the substance and merits of the allegations rather than the individual whistle-blowers, each of whom has a legal right to remain anonymous,” said Mark S. Zaid, one of the whistle-blower’s lawyers.
Mr. Zaid said the official’s act of coming forward to the inspector general had secured whistle-blower protections, and it was not clear if the whistle-blower would file a formal complaint.
The official has also not communicated yet with any congressional committees, Mr. Zaid said. But Democrats said the speed with which the case was becoming public was itself a strong sign of wrongdoing.
Even before the second whistle-blower’s emergence, lawmakers leading the impeachment inquiry were preparing for another jam-packed week of fact-finding that could significantly shape their case. They are scheduled to talk to at least two senior American diplomats: Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former American ambassador to Ukraine who was abruptly removed from her post this year after running afoul of the White House, and Gordon D. Sondland, Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the European Union who closely managed the relationship between the White House and the new Ukrainian government.
Two associates of Mr. Trump’s private lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said to have played roles in his shadow campaign to push for investigations in Ukraine that could benefit the president have also been called to testify. Additional requests for documents and witnesses are also expected.
The first whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer who was detailed to the National Security Council, filed a complaint in August outlining how Mr. Trump used his power to push Ukraine to investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and current presidential candidate, as well as his son Hunter Biden, including in a July 25 phone call with the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky.
The disclosure of a new whistle-blower, first reported by the ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos on his show “This Week,” appeared likely to help House Democrats’ reconstruction of events, even as the White House has so far refused to comply with requests for documents related to Mr. Trump’s efforts to press Ukraine to investigate a leading political rival, and any attempt to conceal his actions.
But on Sunday, the White House shrugged off the news, arguing that it did not change the fact that Mr. Trump did nothing wrong.
“It doesn’t matter how many people decide to call themselves whistle-blowers about the same telephone call — a call the president already made public — it doesn’t change the fact that he has done nothing wrong,” said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary.
Mr. Giuliani framed the news of the new whistle-blower on Sunday as a political hit on the president. “SURPRISE Democrat lawyer has other secret sources,” Mr. Giuliani wrote on Twitter. He added that the bottom line was that there was “no quid pro quo” attached to Mr. Trump’s pressure on Ukrainian officials to investigate his political rivals, and called the story an “ORCHESTRATED DEM CAMPAIGN LIKE KAVANAUGH,” referring to the sexual misconduct allegations against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing.
But with information evolving unusually quickly, few senior congressional Republicans or White House officials have been willing to step out publicly to defend Mr. Trump’s actions. The White House, which has been riven internally about how to handle impeachment proceedings, with no one clearly in charge, did not have any senior officials making the case on the Sunday news shows to defend Mr. Trump.
Of those congressional allies who did make public comments on Sunday, several either focused on attacking Democrats’ handling of the case or said they would reserve judgment until they saw more facts.
Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and a key member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was interested to learn more about the new whistle-blower and offered no defense of Mr. Trump’s actions toward Ukraine. Instead, he said he first wanted to see the results of the Senate’s bipartisan investigation of the matter before making a judgment.
Others were more squarely behind the president.
Representative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah and a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on “Fox News Sunday” that he was “not at all” concerned by the emergence of another whistle-blower because he had already seen a rough transcript of Mr. Trump’s July call with Ukraine’s president that, in his view, was not problematic.
On ABC’s “This Week,” Representative Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican who is one of Mr. Trump’s most steadfast defenders, said the president was merely interested in rooting out legitimate accusations of corruption and that Democrats were unfairly vilifying him for it.
But pressed a half-dozen times to say whether he approved of Mr. Trump’s public remarks this week calling on China to investigate the Bidens, Mr. Jordan would not answer.
Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said in a heated exchange on “Meet the Press” that Mr. Trump had “vehemently, angrily denied” to him withholding aid for Ukraine in exchange for investigating his political rivals.
“Unlike the narrative of the press that President Trump wants to dig up dirt on his 2020 opponent, what he wants is an accounting of what happened in 2016,” Mr. Johnson said.
