A judge on Thursday ruled that a defamation lawsuit filed by the firm at the center of the Panama Papers should be heard in the Los Angeles area.
NEW HAVEN, Conn. — Netflix on Friday released “The Laundromat,” a movie based on the Panama Papers, despite an attempt by two lawyers linked to the documents to stop the streaming premiere.
The movie, starring Gary Oldman, Antonio Banderas and Meryl Streep, was released by the streaming platform after a limited showing in theaters.
The two lawyers, Jürgen Mossack and Ramón Fonseca, filed a lawsuit against Netflix in federal court in Connecticut on Tuesday, saying the movie defamed them and could prejudice criminal cases against them.
A judge on Thursday ruled there was no valid reason to file the case in Connecticut and ordered it transferred to the Los Angeles-area federal court district.
The Panama Papers were a trove of documents leaked from the two lawyers’ firm, Mossack Fonseca in Panama, in a data breach that shed light on how the rich hide their money.
