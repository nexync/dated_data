According to Global Forest Watch, which analyzes data from remote-sensing satellites, nearly 70,000 fire alerts have been recorded this year, almost all of them since June, when the season began. As many as 3,000 fires were reported across the country on some days in September. Sumatra and Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo, have been especially hard hit.
