Democrats want to test the limits of the White House’s refusal to hand over documents and witnesses related to Ukraine.
They want to force executive branch officials to answer to their demands, generating a detailed record of refusals that could shape an impeachment article charging Mr. Trump with obstructing Congress. Democrats also still see other meaningful avenues for gathering evidence that go around the Trump administration’s defiance, including questioning private citizens, former officials, career diplomats near retirement and the whistle-blowers whose revelations fueled the inquiry.
Though they did not issue their request publicly, Democrats moved on Wednesday to line up at least one additional witness deposition, with a former White House foreign policy adviser, and requested she produce documents related to their inquiry.
Fiona Hill, who until this summer served as senior director for Europe at the National Security Council, was expected to appear Monday for a deposition, two officials involved in the inquiry said. Ms. Hill turned over her responsibilities shortly before Mr. Trump’s July phone call with Mr. Zelensky. Axios first reported the request.
Two key State Department figures will also face choices in the coming days about whether to step down and testify to Congress or remain in the administration and keep quiet, according to current and former diplomats.
