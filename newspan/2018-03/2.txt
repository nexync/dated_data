Opinion|What Is Porn?
Yes, there can be good porn. As a theater professional I have seen porn actors who have explored the human body’s limits bravely, openly, nearing the edge of recklessness. I have also viewed porn where the human spirit, removed from standard religious and moral constraints, howls in glee.
There are times I think that a particular porn actor shames the often puritanical stars of Hollywood. Of course, I have also viewed porn that is atrociously dishonest, meaning that the performances are forced or, at times, cruel. All of this, it seems clear to me, reflects the human condition.
And finally, I often see porn on the nightly news, in the headlines coming out of Washington, in the lies told on TV commercials, and in our endless push toward more wars — all of which are is more harmful than viewing sexual adventurers performing for us.
