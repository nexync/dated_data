Passover begins tonight, and if you’re picking up supplies for your Seder, we thought you should know: There is such a thing as matzo hierarchy.
“The top is handmade shmurah matzo, then there is machine-made shmurah matzo, and after that is regular machine-made matzo,” according to Rabbi Motti Seligson, a spokesman for Chabad-Lubavitch.
Passover commemorates Jewish liberation from slavery in Egypt, and matzo represents a sliver of that Exodus — the Jews fled so quickly, the Torah tells us, that there was no time for their bread to rise. For that reason, observers refrain from eating bread (and other leavened goods, chametz) during the holiday.
But what separates shmurah — which the rabbi called “the Bentley of matzo” — from other popular options, like Streit’s, the purveyor that not long ago closed its longstanding flagship on the Lower East Side, is that shmurah matzo is rabbinically supervised at every step, from farmer to field to factory.
At a time when people care increasingly about how their food is sourced — Is it “natural”? Is it organic? Is it fraudulent? — this closely scrutinized class of matzo is seeing a resurgence in New York, Rabbi Seligson said.
It first became popular in New York in the 1950s, he explained, when the rebbe of the Lubavitcher group of Hasidic Jews, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, one of the most influential Jewish leaders of the 20th century, whose following was rooted in Crown Heights, launched a campaign encouraging residents, congregations and bakeries — in Brooklyn and around the world — to offer shmurah matzo.
Decades later, the tradition long cherished by Orthodox communities is gaining traction with less religious, more secular groups, Rabbi Seligson said. Case in point: The Obama Seder, the first presidential Seder, reportedly had shmurah matzo.
Where Friday is lacking, the weekend weather will pick up the slack.
We may have rain today, but we’ll have a sunny Seder on Saturday and a clear Easter on Sunday.

It’s a gray Friday, but it’s a Good Friday.
The annual Way of the Cross procession, a tradition in our city since 1996, will cross from Brooklyn to Manhattan this morning, making stops at several prominent sites for readings and performances.
It begins at Cathedral Basilica of St. James in Downtown Brooklyn at 10 a.m., continuing to the Brooklyn Bridge, City Hall Park and Zuccotti Park before reaching its final destination, at St. Peter’s Church in Lower Manhattan, three hours later.
The walk drew nearly 3,000 participants last year; those joining today will be accompanied by John Bartlett, a retired firefighter from Staten Island who will be carrying the cross; the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn; the archbishop of New York; and other religious leaders.
