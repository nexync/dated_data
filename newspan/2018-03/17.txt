Mike MacDonald, a pioneer of the Canadian stand-up comedy scene, died on Saturday in Ottawa. He was 63.
His brother J. P. MacDonald said that Mr. MacDonald, who had been dealing with various health problems, died of “heart complications ” at the Ottawa Heart Institute.
Mr. MacDonald, who was known for gentle observational humor punctuated by often outlandish facial expressions, was a regular at the annual Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal, where he made the most consecutive appearances of any performer.
He also had several specials on CBC and Showtime and appeared on the talk shows of David Letterman and Arsenio Hall.
“Mike MacDonald was pretty much the first Canadian superstar in our business,” Howard Wagman, owner of the comedy club Yuk Yuk’s Ottawa, where Mr. MacDonald frequently performed, told CBC News. “He was a groundbreaker. He was an original. He was truly Canadian.” Canadian comedians like Tom Green, who called him “one of the greats of stand-up comedy,” considered him an influence.
Mr. MacDonald was born on June 21, 1954, in Metz, France, the son of a career Canadian Air Force officer, and grew up on military bases around the world until his father retired and settled in Ottawa.
He began his career as a drummer and got his start in comedy in the 1970s at an Ottawa punk-rock nightclub, the Rotters Club, before moving to Toronto.
Over the years Mr. MacDonald spoke candidly about his battles with drug abuse and bipolar disorder. (Speaking of his mental illness in his act, he said, “There’s only two kinds of comedians: undiagnosed and diagnosed.”) And in a Facebook post in 2012, he announced that he had been told that he had hepatitis C and that the disease had caused his kidneys to shut down.
He received a liver transplant about five years ago and became an advocate for organ donations, weaving mention of it into his act.
In addition to his brother, a singer who performs under the name Johnny Vegas, Mr. MacDonald’s survivors include his wife, Bonnie.
