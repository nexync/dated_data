He knows none of it. To Mr. Hagerman, life is a spoiler.
— What do you think of Mr. Hagerman’s “Blockade” on the news? Is it a worthy undertaking? Or is it irresponsible? Why do you think so?
— Would you ever consider doing something similar? Why or why not?
— Have you ever reacted strongly to a news event? If so, what was the event and how did you handle it? Did you respond like Mr. Hagerman by taking a break from media for a while? Did it inspire you to become more engaged in the topic in some way? Or did you fall somewhere else on that spectrum?
— In your opinion, are we being bad citizens if we don’t keep up with the news? Do you think all people have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world? Does engaging with current events actually do anything at all? Why do you think the way you do?
— Are there other ways to be a “good” citizen besides consuming media? If so, what are they? What — if anything — have you done to contribute to society in a way that aligns with your own passions and abilities?
