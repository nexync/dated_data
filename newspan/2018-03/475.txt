BARRY 10:30 p.m. on HBO. One week removed from a triumphant return to “Saturday Night Live,” Bill Hader kick-starts a new era of his career with “Barry.” He plays a weary and tightly wound hit man who learned the skills of the trade in Afghanistan. But when he digs into the life of his next mark, an aspiring actor, he finds a passion for acting bubbling to the surface, and begins to take classes, much to the chagrin of his handler. “You don’t expect this comedy to find its target in the way it does,” James Poniewozik wrote about this series in his New York Times review; he named it a Critic’s Pick.
GREAT PERFORMANCES AT THE MET 12 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Last fall, the Met Opera was besieged by live sheep, ghostly violins, slamming doors and shattering dishes in Thomas Adès’s “The Exterminating Angel.” “This riveting, breathless, score — full of quick-cutting shifts, pointillist bursts, and episodes of ballistic intensity — may be his best work,” Anthony Tommasini wrote in his Times review. The opera, inspired by the classic Luis Buñuel film of the same name, follows a hellish dinner party, where the guests find themselves unable to leave; the opera includes the highest note ever sung at the Met.
CALL THE MIDWIFE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This British import has unflinchingly portrayed childbirth in all its messy glory for six seasons. It’s more than a medical show, though, with the almost exclusively female ensemble cast weaving deep relationships and tackling social issues like abortion, incest and racism. The seventh season kicks off with two back-to-back episodes as the midwives of the Nonnatus House continue to endure the brutal winter of 1963 and await the arrival of a new midwife.
