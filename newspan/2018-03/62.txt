What can we say about the state of our country when an adult film star sounds more believable and more intelligent, and is more sympathetic, than the president of the United States?
I do not subscribe to Donald Trump’s conclusion that anything in the media he does not agree with constitutes “fake news,” but I must acknowledge that the media have gone overboard in reporting the stories of Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, two of the many women who assert that the president engaged in extramarital affairs with them.
The much-touted “60 Minutes” interview with Stormy Daniels was believable, captivated the nation and scored spectacular ratings for CBS. But it is no revelation that the thrice-married ladies’ man president who boasted of sexually assaulting women is a person with no moral fiber or character.
His die-hard supporters, many of whom consider themselves to be people of deep faith, do not care what he has done so long as he maintains his few bedrock “principles”: providing tax breaks to the wealthy, appointing conservative Supreme Court justices, and marginalizing racial and sexual minorities and yanking the welcome mat away from immigrants. The non-bombshell “60 Minutes” interview is much ado about very little.
