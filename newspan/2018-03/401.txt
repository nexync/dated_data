When to watch: 9 p.m., on AMC.
Also Monday: Part 1 of Judd Apatow’s loving hagiography “The Zen Diaries of Garry Shandling” airs from 8 to 10 p.m. on HBO; Part 2 airs Tuesday from 8 to 10:30.
When to watch: 8 p.m., on ABC.
The revived “Roseanne” is finally here, and luckily ABC is airing two episodes back-to-back as the premiere. The pilot skews disappointingly acrid, but subsequent episodes have more of the original run’s style and rhythms.
Also Tuesday: The documentary “Dolores,” about the organizer and activist Dolores Huerta, airs as part of PBS’s Independent Lens lineup at 9 p.m. (but check local listings). It’s also the third-season finales of “Baskets” on FX and “The Detour” on TBS, neither of which has been renewed yet for a fourth season.
When to watch: 10 p.m., on FX.
It’s the sixth and final season of this spectacular, challenging espionage drama about two Russian spies posing as an ordinary American couple, and the sense of dread is so intense it has turned my anxiety into a diamond. The episode jumps ahead three years to 1987, putting Paige in college.
Also Wednesday: The Season 7 spring premiere of “Suits” airs at 9 p.m. on USA, kicking off the final arc for Meghan Markle and Patrick J. Adams, who are both leaving the show but for different reasons. When it’s good, “Suits” is a lot of fun, but this episode’s conflict is contrived, not juicy.
When to watch: 8 p.m., on Freeform.
 Welcome to Bristol Cove, where the locals have noticed some unusual goings-on in the ocean, and one furious mermaid has found herself be-legged and on land. “Siren” is the latest entry into the dark-teen genre, and it’s a solid contender, hitting the “small town with secrets” stuff and turning general mermaid mythology into something much darker. It’s too violent for very young viewers, but it’s in the “Vampire Diaries”/“Pretty Little Liars” range.
