President Trump’s inaction in handling the opioid epidemic (“Mr. Trump’s Bluster on Opioids,” editorial, March 21) is heartbreaking.
The point of “draining the swamp” was to more effectively address problems that career politicians neglected, with the overprescription of opioids being a prime example. Instead, we have a president who would rather project the image of improvement than actually institute effective changes.
This is also seen in the issue of infrastructure, which Mr. Trump is happy to let fall by the wayside, knowing that his base wants him to build an impractical border wall instead.
His solutions for the opioid problem reflect his desire for brash and dramatic “solutions”; his proposal to arm teachers occupies the same world as his call to execute drug dealers. What’s heartbreaking is that there are sensible, boring ways to fix such problems but that Mr. Trump most likely will never put them to use.
