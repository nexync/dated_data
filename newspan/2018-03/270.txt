It was a quiet day at Video Room, the 500-square-foot independent video store on 80th Street and Third Avenue. 
At its peak — the mid-1980s through the early ’90s — Video Room, then located on 84th Street and Third Avenue, had about six people at the counter, with phones trilling endlessly and lines of customers.
Now, usually one employee works the counter to help the occasional walk-in.
That of course changed.
In January, the store stopped renting VHS tapes. Since 1997, it has specialized in DVD rentals, but now also offers a digital tape transfer service.
On a recent afternoon, James Tozer, 12, wandered in with his sitter. “Do you have games?” he asked.
“Nope. Sorry,” Mr. Feingold said.
“No, they’re for rent,” Mr. Feingold said.
“People like to go to a place and read boxes. The reading of the boxes is the key to everything,” said Howard Salen, 67, who has been a Video Room employee since 1986.
“We rent to people who want something specific: foreign films, classic American films, things that Netflix probably won’t have,” Mr. Salen said. “The BBC and other foreign TV series are our most popular.” The store has at least 5,000 foreign titles and 20,000 DVD titles, he said. They are all located behind the counter, unboxed, alphabetized and slipped into thin plastic sleeves.
But is that enough to keep customers coming back?
