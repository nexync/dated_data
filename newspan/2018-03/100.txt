Annemarie Lehrmann Hillman and Douglas Joseph Rosenthal were married March 17 at the District Winery in Washington. Judge Amit P. Mehta of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, for whom the bride served as a law clerk, officiated.
The bride, 32, is a litigation associate in the Washington office of Sidley Austin, the Chicago-based law firm. She graduated cum laude from Yale, and received a law degree, cum laude, from N.Y.U.
She is a daughter of Ingrid H. Lehrmann of Clifton Park, N.Y., and Paul L. Hillman of Cleverdale, N.Y. The bride’s father owns a group of transportation companies based in Glens Falls, N.Y., bearing his name.
The groom, 35, is a trial lawyer at the Justice Department in Washington. He graduated from Princeton and received a law degree from Harvard.
He is the son of Joan K. Rosenthal and Barry P. Rosenthal of Washington. The groom’s mother is a retired social worker in Washington. His father, also a lawyer, retired as the general counsel of the JBG Companies, a real estate investment trust, now known as JBG Smith, based in Washington.
The couple met in December 2014 at a party given by a mutual friend in Washington, and though they liked each other, they did not act on those feelings. Two months later, on Valentine’s Day 2015, they reconnected in a familiar place: the home of the same mutual friend in Washington who was having yet another party.
