Craig Mack, the rapper whose “Flava in Ya Ear,” one of the most important rap songs of the 1990s, helped build the foundation for Bad Boy Records, one of hip-hop’s most influential labels, died on Monday at his home in Walterboro, S.C. He was 47.
Richard Harvey, the Colleton County coroner, said the death was “natural” and did not otherwise give the cause.
Mr. Mack, who rapped under his given name, was born in the Bronx on May 10, 1970, and raised on Long Island. He began rapping as a teenager under the name MC EZ and released one single in 1988, “Just Rhymin’ ” backed with “Get Retarded,” as part of MC EZ & Troup.
At the time, Long Island was a burgeoning hip-hop talent center, home to Rakim, De La Soul and the duo EPMD. Mr. Mack was friends with EPMD and eventually went on tour with them, doing odd jobs. He helped their D.J., DJ Scratch, assemble and disassemble his turntables at shows.
After a few years without forward movement in his recording career, Mr. Mack took advantage of an opportunity to rap for Sean Combs, then known as Puff Daddy, outside the New York nightclub Mecca, and secured a record deal with Mr. Combs’s label, Bad Boy.
Mr. Mack was the first rapper to release music on Bad Boy, which would become one of the definitive New York rap labels of the 1990s and the foundation of a multiplatform empire for Mr. Combs.
The Notorious B.I.G. also appeared on the remix of “Flava in Ya Ear,” one of the essential remixes of the 1990s, with a stark black-and-white music video — an early high-profile production by the director Hype Williams — that was an arresting, mature shift in tone for the genre.
He continued recording music under his own Mack World Records imprint, two collections of which were eventually released: “Operation Why2K?” in 2012 and “The Mack World Sessions” last year. He had lately been working on music with the producer Erick Sermon of EPMD.
This world gives you death, but I wanna live.
