Women’s rights, and art by and about women, are the subjects of exhibitions at a number of museums this year.
• In New York, the Center for Women’s History at the New-York Historical Society will mark its one-year anniversary with several programs. Exhibitions include the Joyce B. Cowin Women’s History Gallery, which focuses on women who have made an impact on the American experience through activism, art, literature and politics. Women’s Voices, an interactive, multimedia digital experience, showcases stories of famous and forgotten women and the movements and groups to which they belonged. “We Rise,” a documentary narrated by Meryl Streep, highlights the diverse group of women and ideas that arose in New York before the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote in 1920.
• Across town at the Museum of the City of New York, “Beyond Suffrage: A Century of New York Women in Politics” (through Aug. 5) takes a long look at political activism by women in New York City, from the fight to win the vote (granted to women in New York State in 1917) through current issues. Included is a look at how women often toiled behind the scenes for causes like health and labor, and the role New York played in women’s rights efforts in the 1960s.
• Works by the New York artist Red, in a show called “100 Women and More,” will be on display through May 7 at Soka University of America in Aliso Viejo, Calif. Portraits of influential women throughout history, dating as far back as 1500 B.C., are created through burning or ink on 5-by-7 wooden ovals, along with short biographies.
• Later this year, the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington will turn to fashion for its exhibition on Rodarte (Nov. 2 to Feb. 10, 2019). The American label is the brainchild of sisters Kate and Laura Mulleavy of Southern California, who are the first designers to be recognized with a solo exhibition organized by the museum. The focus of the show is to place the work of Rodarte “within the landscape of contemporary art and fashion,” according to the museum. The show is expected to include about 90 ensembles, as well as accessories, photograph and videos.
