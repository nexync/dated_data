Lies. Of course the White House is in chaos. It’s just that Trump has lived his whole life in a state of chaos, so it feels perfectly normal to him. The only energy around Trump is a vortex of complicity and incompetence.
Furthermore, it should be clear to us all at this point that Trump’s public relations approach to dealing with unfavorable news is simply to rush to the nearest microphone — or log into Twitter — and say that the exact opposite is true, even when his statement is an easily provable lie.
Being right is never the point; retaliation is the point.
That, again, is just a lie. Reporters covering this White House have been writing for months that people have trepidations about joining this White House.
Part of that is due to the extraordinary level of turnover in this administration.
This is exactly the opposite of what Trump told us would happen.
In April 2016, Trump wrote on Facebook, “I am self funding and will hire the best people, not the biggest donors!” when posting an article about Democrats’ hopes to work in a potential Hillary Clinton administration.
Indeed, ABC News put together a video montage of Trump promising to hire the “best people” over 10 times.
It all turned out to be a lie.
Trump is the worst boss who hires the worst people: People who confess to crimes, are secretly operating as foreign agents, allegedly beat their wives and have absolutely no expertise in the area in which they work.
When you choose loyalists and sycophants over experts and professionals, this disaster of an administration is what you get.
