Before there was Euro Disney the theme park, there was Euro Disney the comic books. Now, after more than six decades, the European adventures of Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge will be released in the United States.
The Disney comics written by European cartoonists, including Romano Scarpa, Luciano Bottaro and Daan Jippes, have been translated into English as part of a new series introducing American readers to some of Disney’s international artists.
Fantagraphics, a graphic novel imprint, is publishing the collection as part of its “Disney Masters” series. Starting in May, the series will feature full-color hardback volumes of the comics, many of which are in English for the first time. “It’s an international look at Disney comic creation,” Michael Catron, the series editor, said.
The first volume is by Mr. Scarpa, a prestigious Italian cartoonist who started working for Disney in 1953. The 200-page volume features a story about Mickey battling against a poison rainstorm. Mr. Scarpa, who died in 2005, was one of the best-known Italian Disney authors.
The new series will build on Fantagraphics’ existing collection of Disney comic book volumes from well-known American cartoonists such as Carl Barks, Don Rosa and Floyd Gottfredson.
Other volumes in the series include contributions by the Dutch cartoonist, Mr. Jippes; Freddy Milton, from Denmark; Mr. Bottaro, from Italy; and the American artist Paul Murry.
