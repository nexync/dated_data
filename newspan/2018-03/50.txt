“Will I be the oldest person here?” I asked the chairman of the nonfiction writing program at Columbia University, shortly after I was accepted. He laughed and said no. There were two or three older, but not by much.
“It takes a lifetime to make a writer,” he continued.
And I’ve had the lifetime.
I was 64 when I entered graduate school. I had just left the work force — not retired, just tired. Tired of hitting the glass ceiling and of policies that failed to protect employees from abuse. As disenchantment with my job grew, writing became a healthy distraction.
I applied to Columbia with no expectation of acceptance and no idea how to pay for it. My husband and I had just finished paying for our kids’ education and we didn’t have enough for retirement. But then one snowy February evening, the head of the writing program called as I stirred a pot of soup, and said, “You’re in, and there will be a scholarship.” I dropped my wooden spoon.
Sure, I’d written copy at ad agencies for 20 years, started a memoir and taken some online classes. But did that make me a writer? And the Ivy League part scared me. I imagined I wasn’t smart enough. But I also realized I had some things to say.
I sat in workshops and seminars during my first semester at Columbia, ashamed of my age and surrounded by brilliant young people. They were polite, but I assumed my work held little interest for them. I don’t swipe for sex. I haven’t pulled an all-nighter in decades. I thought they’d laugh at my flapping upper arms and my wrinkly neck, even though many of them admire Nora Ephron.
Some of my instructors were close in age to me, winners of Pulitzers with decades of writing and publishing experience. Some were just a little older than my children. I wondered, was it too late for me to do this?
My peers wrote about online dating, strange roommates, odd living situations, first big loves and rejections. Others wrote memoirs about life with a meth-addicted father or what it means to be biracial. We all struggled to be emotionally honest on the page. For me, that meant finding restraint and perspective by stepping back, seeing my own complicity in much of what’s happened in my life.
My classmates transported me back to my own 20s and 30s. I attended the University of California, Berkeley, during the second wave of feminism. In the 1970s, solidarity with the antiwar movement meant cooking for the male demonstrators. Now things are different. Gender identification is not assumed. Respect for difference is. I’ve been asked not only for my name but also for my preferred pronouns.
Inevitably, I blundered. One icy January morning I dug out the warmest coat I owned. On my way into class, shivering vegans jeered at me. What was I thinking? My kids are vegan. The coat, trimmed in rabbit fur at the neckline, now hangs at the back of my closet where my cat occasionally tries to kill it or have sex with it.
After several workshops in which everyone felt overexposed, I realized no one cared how old I was. Workshops are like the painting critiques I endured as an undergraduate in the art department at Berkeley. But they’re different now — criticism no longer terrifies me. My defensiveness has been worn away. I’m better able to hear the helpful parts and understand what I would have taken personally years ago. I’m finally a good student. And I don’t have to worry that what I write will make things awkward with my parents at Christmas.
I have fewer distractions than my younger classmates. Dating and the insecurity that went with it are memories. Figuring out my sexuality and experimenting with illegal substances no longer consume my weekends.
One professor said, “You have to write badly before you can write well.” Along with my fear of being too old, my first semester held plenty of writing badly. But I kept going, figuring they’d admitted me and provided a scholarship for a reason.
Now I’m in my final semester. I’m amazed by my talented peers and by their easygoing acceptance and candor. Despite the age difference, we’ve fed one another in many ways — emotionally, intellectually and literally (I’ve brought tomatoes from my garden, while another student brought freshly baked bread). Although my professors have been stellar, much of my education has come from reading and listening to my fellow students — on a grandmother in India; an Armenian family’s path, post-genocide; sorority life in 2017; and what it means to be transgender within an authoritarian regime.
I’ve been warned by my professors that a degree in writing is unlikely to bring riches. That’s okay. I’ve been enriched beyond measure. And like my peers, I’ve got some stories to tell. A lifetime of them.
