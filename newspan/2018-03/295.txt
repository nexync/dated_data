In “What Poisons Are in Your Body?” (column, Feb. 25), Nicholas Kristof painted a number of chemicals with a broad brush and left readers to believe that the mere presence of these chemicals in the body posed an imminent threat to human health.
Mr. Kristof’s concerns come at a time when chemical oversight is stronger than it has ever been thanks to a law enacted in 2016, which significantly strengthened the regulation of chemicals in commerce.
This means that consumers can benefit from various lifesaving and life-enhancing chemicals, knowing that chemicals are subject to rigorous federal review.
