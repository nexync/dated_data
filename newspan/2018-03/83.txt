When the International Criminal Court first said it was looking into widespread murders under President Rodrigo Duterte’s antidrug campaign in the Philippines, he said he welcomed a chance to take the stand. On Wednesday the swaggering president changed his tune, denouncing what he called “baseless, unprecedented and outrageous attacks on my person” and saying he will pull the Philippines out of the I.C.C.
Thankfully, that doesn’t put the court out of business in the Philippines, where the police and vigilantes have killed thousands of drug dealers. It takes a year for a country to withdraw from the I.C.C., so the preliminary investigation opened by the chief prosecutor into a complaint filed by a Filipino lawyer can proceed.
The report submitted by the lawyer laid out evidence that Mr. Duterte has been responsible for over 8,000 deaths since he opened his war on drugs as mayor of Davao City in 1988. Mr. Duterte won the 2016 election in a landslide on a promise to kill more criminals and eradicate drugs in Philippine society.
There is no question that drugs are a blight in the Philippines, and Mr. Duterte remains enormously popular. Among his fans is President Trump, who has praised Mr. Duterte for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem” and advocated the death penalty for drug dealers.
But suspending democratic protections leads to greater abuses. What began as a war on drugs has expanded to include Mr. Duterte’s critics, including the media and international human rights organizations.
The International Criminal Court is supposed to step in if national courts don’t bring to justice perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. (The United States, long resistant to giving any international body legal jurisdiction over Americans, is one of a handful of countries that have not joined the court.) The Philippine president’s belated attempt to elude the court should only spur it to greater efforts.
