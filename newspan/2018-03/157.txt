Poull Brien — the documentary director and producer behind the 2012 film “Charles Bradley: Soul of America,” about an aspiring soul singer in his 60s — has signed a three-year lease with a two-year option for a 1,100-square-foot second-floor loft space in this four-story building, which is on a commercial strip. A wall of south-facing windows allows a good deal of natural light into the studio, which is to be used for production, film editing and photo shoots. The tenant received a month rent-free for the build-out.
