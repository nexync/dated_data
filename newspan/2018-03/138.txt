The director Eli Roth made his name with adults-only horror films like “Hostel,” but he’s setting out to scare a younger audience with “The House With a Clock in its Walls,” which has just released its first trailer.
Adapted by Eric Kripke (TV’s “Supernatural”) from the young-adult novel by John Bellairs, the story follows an orphan, Lewis (Owen Vaccaro), who moves into the spooky titular abode with his uncle (Jack Black).
“The House With a Clock in its Walls” arrives in theaters on Sept. 21.
