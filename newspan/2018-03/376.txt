• The Trump administration said it would exempt the European Union and other allies from stiff steel and aluminum tariffs that go into effect today, but in a twist, the administration may impose import quotas to prevent too much foreign metal from flooding into the United States.
The move came as President Trump announced plans to impose about $60 billion worth of annual tariffs on Chinese imports, in punishment for what the White House says is China’s pattern of co-opting American tech and trade secrets.
China hit back Friday morning, proposing reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of American-made imports, and said that it would also pursue legal action against the U.S. at the World Trade Organization.
Separately, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, will be replaced by John R. Bolton, a hard-line former U.S. ambassador who supported Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U.

There are functioning schools and a hospital (above, displaying the image of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan). And the Turkish presence has deterred the Syrian government from bombing the area.
The victory in Afrin has emboldened Mr. Erdogan, who has vowed to continue his military campaign across northern Syria.

Allen Walker Read, a longtime English professor at Columbia University, debunked some theories in the 1960s, including that the term had come from Andrew Jackson’s poor spelling, a Native American word or an Army biscuit.
Today, O.K. is “an Americanism adopted by virtually every language, and one of the first words spoken on the moon,” the Times obituary of Mr. Read noted in 2002.
