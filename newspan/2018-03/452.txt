Since my retirement as a commissioner on the board, I have been advocating for the release of long-termers who are now aged or addled but transformed by time and maturity, and who pose no risk to the community. I can do this because I’m not concerned about political fallout and my job security.
So I congratulate the board for its integrity in granting parole to Mr. Bell. The decision shows that the panel members understand their role: to assess the candidate’s risk to the public after the person has served the court-determined sentence and to grant parole, with continued supervision in the community, unless the parole panel can articulate clearly why the person poses a threat.
This job does not include re-sentencing because of the nature of a crime; your editorial is entirely correct that “vengeance is not supposed to guide a system of justice.” Victims who call for eternal lockup should also know that vengeance doesn’t heal.
