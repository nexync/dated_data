THE LATE LATE SHOW WITH JAMES CORDEN 12:35 a.m. (Tuesday) on CBS. The post-Golden Globes shouts of “Oprah 2020” may have slowed, but it’s hard to imagine that the topic won’t at least be alluded to when Oprah Winfrey appears on “The Late Late Show.” Ms. Winfrey plays the role of Mrs. Which in the Ava DuVernay-directed Disney film adaptation of the children’s novel “A Wrinkle in Time,” which opened over the weekend. Her co-stars Mindy Kaling (whose new sitcom, “Champions,” began last week) and Reese Witherspoon will also appear on the show.
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE (2012) on Netflix and Amazon. If you liked Ava DuVernay’s adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time” — or for a primer on the director before you see that film — a natural place to start is with her breakthrough movie, about a nurse, Ruby (Emayatzy Corinealdi), whose husband, Derek (Omari Hardwick), has been given a multiyear prison sentence. In her review for The Times, Manohla Dargis called the film “a plaintive, slow-boiling, quietly soul-stirring drama about a woman coming into her own.” Its cast includes David Oyelowo, who plays a bus driver. Ms. DuVernay’s prison documentary “13th” (2016) is also available on Netflix, and her historical drama “Selma” (2014), which stars Mr. Oyelowo as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., can been watched on Amazon.
THE HAIRY BIKERS’ PUBS THAT BUILT BRITAIN on AcornTV. The cheeky television hosts Si King and Dave Myers dig into the history of English drinking establishments. In this BBC Two series, the pair known as the Hairy Bikers travel England visiting interesting pubs. It’s a bit like “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” for cask ale devotees.
