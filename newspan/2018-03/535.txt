VARIETY PUZZLE — It’s fitting that our merry pranksters get cute today. I’ll mention only a couple of things about my experience solving this backward creation: First, I’m grateful that so many clues were straightforward (ha-ha), and second, I very specifically felt discomfort and distress at the exact same point I discovered those words in this passage. I don’t know whether to chalk that up to suggestibility or if the Cox-Rathvon team made that happen somehow.
You see, you run this passage, from Moira Marsh’s “Practically Joking,” backward from 176, the final square at the bottom right, to 1. You also read the attribution of the quote from V to A, in the clues, rather than regular alphabetical order.
The most disconcerting part about solving this puzzle for me was keeping the numbers straight. Whenever my mind deduced a word from near the beginning of the quote (“discomfort but not necessarily distress”) my writing hand rebelled at filling in the prescribed boxes because they were toward the end of the grid — I moved to the upper left rather than the lower right, if that makes sense. You may have had a completely different experience.
This acrostic made me think of palindromes. There’s a 543-word phrase here that reads the same backward as it does forward, as well as dozens of other examples if you care to further your reverse reading.
My favorite new fact gleaned here, however, was the existence of LOU REED spiders. They’re quite incredible!
This is all the fault of Gene Weingarten, humor columnist for The Washington Post. He’s been prodding us for a long time to do something impish on this particular date. His original idea was trickier than this, but it defied the format available to us — and we can’t describe his gimmick because he may manage to perpetrate it elsewhere someday. Anyhow, a happy whatever-day-it-is to all solvers. And here’s a bonus comic strip penned by Gene.
