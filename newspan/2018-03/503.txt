This week’s word: nene.
If it looks like a goose and honks like a goose, it should just be a goose, right? However, the nene (pronounced nay-nay) is special. Not only is it Hawaii’s state bird, it’s also the world’s rarest goose.
Its webbed feet have adapted to living on hardened lava, but it is a weak flier. Nenes were once hunted nearly to extinction, but conservation efforts have bolstered their population.
Another reason to know your nenes is that, although rare in the wild, they often come up in crossword puzzles. Nene has been an entry in Times crosswords 295 times since 1944.
You can find out about the nene and other birds that appear regularly in our Crossword Aviary.
