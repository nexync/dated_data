Opera Philadelphia has of late prioritized embracing new work and unorthodox programming; last month, New York Times critic Zachary Woolfe wrote that the company “has swiftly become one of the most creative and ambitious in this country.” On Tuesday, the company announced its 2018-19 season, which will include a second annual citywide festival and two world premieres.
The festival, O18, will race through five operatic performances from Sept. 20-30. (“It may be a risk, but it’s one well worth taking,” Anthony Tommasini wrote of last year’s iteration.) On Sept. 20, the Perelman Theater will host the premiere of “Sky on Swings,”an opera about two women suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, by the composer Lembit Beecher and the librettist Hannah Moscovitch. Starting on Sept. 22 at the Barnes Foundation, the countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo will perform in “Glass Handel,” an art installation that fuses the music of Handel and Philip Glass.
The multimedia piece will include live painting, a new dance work by Justin Peck, and videos from James Ivory — who just won an Oscar for his “Call Me By Your Name” screenplay. The festival will close with a three-night cabaret performance titled “Queens of the Night,” with Stephanie Blythe and Dito van Reigersberg.
The company’s regular programming at its home base, the Academy of Music, features more known quantities. Brenda Rae stars in Donizetti’s “Lucia di Lammermoor” starting Sept. 21; Britten’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” arrives on Feb. 8 with Tim Mead and Anna Christy as Oberon and Tytania; Puccini’s “La Bohème” begins April 26, with Mimi played by Vanessa Vasquez, a Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions winner. Mozart’s “Don Giovanni,” conducted by Karina Canellakis, plays at the Perelman theater starting March 7.
