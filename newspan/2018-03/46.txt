We’d Like to Know: Where Would You Go in Wakanda?
The Travel Desk would like to solicit your ideas of what an actual Wakanda trip would look like. We will feature 10 of the most innovative submissions in a future Travel issue.
In the film “Black Panther,” the mythical African nation of Wakanda, known to outsiders as a small and mostly agrarian country, is protected by a holographic camouflage, which shields its advanced society from the rest of the world. Among the many great things about the film is its emphasis on Wakanda’s technological gems, along with showcasing the landscape of the modern country. However, to the casual filmgoer, there is a lot that can be left to the imagination.
The Travel Desk would like to solicit your ideas of what an actual Wakanda trip would look like. Do you see Wakanda as a series of magical neighborhoods floating in midair? Would the magnetic levitation subway in Wakanda travel around its capital city like a graceful roller coaster? Maybe you might see the Wakanda countryside as a collection of broad valleys and lakes, with the glimmer of the distant metropolis as a backdrop? What kinds of things would you do in Wakanda? Would there be an abundance of infinity pools and virtual reality bowling alleys? The possibilities are truly endless.
In a future Travel issue, we will feature 10 of the most innovative submissions, so start brainstorming and have fun!
