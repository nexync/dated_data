Dropbox’s rich valuation should give investors pause.
Dropbox faces fierce competition, doesn’t make a profit, its user growth has slowed, and outside shareholders have negligible voting power.
Yet for now, at least, investors think the company has an amazing future.
This optimism is reflected in the price of Dropbox’s shares after they traded publicly for the first time on Friday. They leaped to $29 per share from $21, giving Dropbox, which charges businesses and individuals to store files on its computers, a market value of $12.7 billion. Putting that number in context reveals the bullishness of investors. Dropbox didn’t have any profits in recent years, so comparisons have to be done using revenue and cash flows.
At $29, Dropbox is trading at 11.5 times last year’s revenue of $1.1 billion. That is far higher than the 2.6 times sales for the companies in the Nasdaq index, according to Bloomberg data.
Of course, Dropbox’s shares have benefited from demand for initial public offerings by technology companies. The stock might give back the gains, just as Snap’s did after its I.P.O. last year.
Still, Dropbox’s fans believe that the company has a strong financial future, despite competition from the likes of Google and Amazon. One of their main arguments is that the company can increase its revenue faster than its costs, a dynamic that should expand profit margins over time. Rishi N. Jaluria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, zeros in on its free cash flows, the amount of cash generated by a business after subtracting spending on plants and certain lease payments, to show this.
His measure of free cash flows was equivalent to 16 percent of revenue last year, but, in his estimation, that margin could rise to 19 percent this year, then 22 percent in 2019.
After Friday’s huge pop, Dropbox’s stock has arguably “priced in” the impressive future cash flows that some analysts expect. Indeed, using Mr. Jaluria’s forecasts, Dropbox’s shares are already trading at a far higher cash flow valuation than that of Salesforce, a software and cloud computing company with a long track record.
What is more, Dropbox has areas of concern that should, in theory, give investors pause. The number of paid users grew 25 percent last year, slower than the 35 percent rate in 2016. Its average revenue per paying user edged up just 1 percent last year. Facebook’s shares trade at the same multiple to sales as Dropbox’s. Yet its revenue per user surged 26 percent last year.
Dropbox closed up 36 percent in its market debut.
Dropbox finished at $28.48, up 36 percent from its initial public offering price.
The file-storage company on Thursday sold 36 million shares at $21 apiece. That was above its expected range of $18 to $20 a share and valued the company $9.2 billion.
• So far this year, 38 companies have listed shares on American exchanges, raising $12.8 billion. That’s up 13 percent from a year ago and the most year to date since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters.
• The shares of companies that have debuted on American exchanges this year are up, on average, 15%.
• Since the start of 2017, shares of tech companies that have gone public are up 72 percent.
The closer investors look at President Trump’s tariffs against China, the less they seem to like them.
This can be seen in the way the stock market has responded to the trade restrictions, which were announced on Thursday but were flagged a few days earlier. The S.&P. 500 index was down 5.95 percent this week, falling every day but one. And the selling at the end of the week looked like like it was turning into a rout, with the S.&P. 500 skidding 2.52 percent on Thursday and 2.1 percent on Friday.
We know that Mr. Trump watches the stock market’s response to his policies. He was reassured when the stock market rose after he announced tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Will this week’s nosedive unsettle him to the point he softens his stance on trade with China? Mr. Trump sounded unfazed on Friday. “I think the stock market is going to be great,” he said.
Trump signs spending bill.
The president abruptly backed down from his threat to veto the $1.3 trillion spending bill and signed it into law on Friday, avoiding a government shutdown.
Early in the day, the president had tweeted his displeasure with the bill, citing Congress’s failure to fund his long-promised border wall.
But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for a massive wall on the nation’s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigrants. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security — including new technology and repairs to existing barriers — but not Mr. Trump’s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday. It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered, and allocates the rest of the funding for new aircraft, sensors and surveillance technology.
In most of the interviews on Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg was asked if he would be willing to testify before Congress, a task he has previously delegated to other senior Facebook executives.
He then went on to offer Facebook’s standard response to questions about why it has previously chosen other executives for Congressional hearings.
The goal there is to get Congress all the information that they need to do their extremely important job. And we just want to send the person whoever is best informed to do that.
The question in Congressional testimony is, “What is the goal?” That’s not a media opportunity. At least it’s not supposed to be.
Mr. Zuckerberg was surely being coy. When Congress requests the presence of a C.E.O. embroiled in a high-profile controversy, they’re usually not looking for information. They want a pelt to hang on the wall, and celebrity chief executives are particularly attractive.
So it’s definitely a media opportunity… but for members of Congress, not the C.E.O.
If Mr. Zuckerberg wants proof of that, he can ask John Stumpf, the former C.E.O. of Wells Fargo, and the bank’s current chief executive, Tim Sloan, how much information they were asked to provide. He could ask the same of the C.E.O. of United Airlines, Oscar Munoz, about his trip to Capitol Hill just after a passenger was dragged off one of his airplanes. For that matter, Mr. Zuckerberg could walk down the hallway and ask Facebook’s general counsel, Colin Stretch. Just last fall Mr. Stretch endured a Senate lashing over the use of Facebook by Russian operatives.
When Mr. Zuckerberg is brought in to testify, the committee’s “goal” will be to ensure the American public understands why social media platforms can’t be trusted to regulate themselves. Mr. Zuckerberg’s goal will be to try to avoid acting in a way that would elevate his role as the designated villain in the story.
Mr. Zuckerberg seems resigned to the fact that he will likely end up testifying. “I would imagine at some time there will be a topic where I will be the sole authority on, and it will make sense for me to do it,” he told Ms. Segall.
After this past week, he will have little leeway to refuse. Having been roundly accused of hiding in the crucial early days of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he won’t want to provide further evidence that he is inaccessible when people need to see him most.

Did China intervene to support its stock market?
China’s state-backed funds have a history of stepping in to smooth out swings in the country’s stock market. And so on Friday as China stocks tumbled amid fears of a trade war with the United States, those funds began buying, Bloomberg reports, citing unnamed sources.
They purchased large-cap stocks, including Sinopec and China Life Insurance Co., Bloomberg reports.
Shares of both those companies erased losses late in the trading session, and the large-cap CSI 300 Index finished down 2.9 percent after falling as much as 4.6 percent.
Maybe not so fast on a Target-Kroger deal?
Shares in both retailers are up in premarket trading this morning after Fast Company reported that the two sides are weighing a union. Shares in Kroger were up 4 percent, while those in Target were up over 2 percent.
The purported rationale: the usual one. Retailers are under pressure from Amazon and need to get bigger both in brick-and-mortar stores and online.

Broadcom’s shareholders approved the chip maker’s decision to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. The move is expected to be completed after the market’s close on April 4.
The vote comes nearly two weeks after President Trump blocked Broadcom’s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm, citing national security concerns.
The decision was a blow to Broadcom and its chief executive, Hock Tan, who had gone to great lengths to deflect concerns by American regulators and the Trump administration. That included appearing in a televised speech at the White House with Mr. Trump last November, during which Mr. Tan promised to redomicile Broadcom in the United States.
Will the U.S.-China trade fight be a flicker or an inferno?
They’re here. President Trump imposed $60 billion worth of tariffs and penalties on Chinese goods. China is threatening tariffs on $3 billion worth of U.S. goods like nuts, wine and pork. Now S.&P. 500 futures and markets in Asia and Europe are down this morning, following yesterday’s steep sell-off (which was driven in large part by Boeing).
The context: Mr. Trump has made subtext — China is the U.S.’s main economic rival and must be treated as a strategic competitor — text. Few in the U.S. are happy with Beijing’s trade and intellectual property policies. But the world is now watching to see whether the fight turns out to be a spat, or a prolonged and damaging conflict.
Peter Eavis’s take: A trade fight that eventually relaxes some of China’s disadvantageous conditions could bolster the long-term prospects of U.S. firms. And if the U.S. is able to recruit other countries to its cause, China may relent. Still, much could go wrong.
On the other tariffs: The E.U. is still waiting for confirmation of exemptions from the imported metals tariffs. They may get quotas instead. Meet Century Aluminum, the tiny manufacturer that pressed for those penalties.
The state’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is expected to announce today that Bank of America Merrill Lynch is settling an investigation over its electronic trading practices.
Mr. Schneiderman is expected to announce that the bank routed some clients’ trade orders to so-called electronic liquidity providers like Citadel Securities, then doctored trade confirmations and post-trade reports to say it had executed them in-house. The attorney general said the process was applied to some 16 million client orders between 2008 and 2013.
He has previously gone after Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank over their electronic trading practices.

Which lenders will follow Citi on gun sale limits?
Its new requirements, for businesses who borrow money from it or want to offer its co-branded credit cards, include limiting sales to those 21 and older, requiring background checks, and banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.
