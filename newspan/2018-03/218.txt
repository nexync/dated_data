Almost everyone who lives or works in a big city knows the feeling: You’re sitting inside a quiet subway car when the doors open and a throng of children — often on a class trip — boards the train. Your quiet car is suddenly loud and packed with people jostling for space. Sometimes, it’s worth moving to another car.
On my morning commute yesterday, one of these throngs entered my subway car, but this time I didn’t mind at all. The teenagers — a mix of black, white, Latino and Asian — were in a buoyant mood. Many were carrying signs. They were headed to a gun protest outside the White House.
At times yesterday, the protesting students seemed to be everywhere — on social media, on television, in communities. And they offered a needed jolt of inspiration in a dark political time. David Axelrod, the political strategist, has said that today’s central political battle is cynicism versus idealism, and it’s clear which side the students are on.
If you haven’t yet looked at photos, videos or media coverage of the protests, I encourage you to do so.
• The students held a 17-minute silence outside the White House yesterday to honor the 17 victims from Parkland, Fla. (and Nathalie Baptiste of Mother Jones has a short video).
• The Times collected images from around the country.
• “The laws are going to be written, they’re going to be passed, and they’re going to be upheld, because we are not going to stop until it does,” said Cate Whitman, a junior at LaGuardia High School in New York, during a rally.
A new militarization. Among the many reasons to be worried about a State Department run by Mike Pompeo (and Donald Trump) is what my colleague Roger Cohen has called “a radical militarization of American foreign policy.” Former military officers occupy a growing list of top government jobs, which suggests that military action may increasingly replace diplomacy as America’s main foreign-policy tool.
“The tea leaves here are not encouraging,” Stewart Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote for its website. He notes that Pompeo has been an outspoken advocate of paramilitary covert action and expanded it while running the C.I.A.
