• U.S. trade partners are resorting to persuasion, threats, personal appeals and diplomatic leverage to jockey for exemptions from new American metal tariffs.
A trade war would threaten to diminish living standards globally and risk reducing the World Trade Organization, the arbiter to such disputes, to insignificance.
In the U.S., President Trump has the support of the steel industry, but others in his base are worried: Midwest farmers are concerned that retaliation could hurt their exports.
Our Op-Ed columnist Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate for his research on trade, writes that “the tariffs could unwind the whole global trade system.” You can ask him your questions here.
That was Stephen Bannon, the former chief strategist for President Trump, addressing the party congress of the National Front in Lille, France.
The speech was part of a tour through Europe, in which he seeks to support the Continent’s strongmen (like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary) and populists (like Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Front).
• In China, the rubber-stamp legislature’s vote was almost unanimous: Presidential term limits are gone, as expected, allowing Xi Jinping, 64, to rule for life.
China’s leaders appear to be discarding a lesson that their fathers drew from the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution: the danger of concentrating power in an unassailable leader.
Meanwhile, President Trump’s series of erratic moves — from threats of new tariffs to an impromptu overture to North Korea — has helped cast Mr. Xi as the more stable leader in Asia.
• In Syria, government forces intensified their assault on the rebel-held Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta. Meanwhile, Turkish forces are said to have advanced to the outskirts of the Kurdish-controlled town of Afrin.
As the Kurdish-dominated coalition shifted its fighters to battle the Turkish assault, our correspondent visited the somewhat quiet headquarters of the Syrian Democratic Forces in the town of Ainissa.
There, the uneasy alliance of Kurds and Arabs, helped by U.S. forces and held together by the fight against the Islamic State, risks being tested as the Kurds consolidate their control.
• Educators in Britain, after decades spent in a collective effort to minimize risk for children, are now, cautiously, trying to provide it.
The shift, they say, signals the end of a decades-long drift toward overprotecting children.
For experts, a limited exposure to risks provides experiences that are essential to childhood development and useful in building resilience and grit.

The headlines from Washington are often controversial, but one of the U.S. capital’s most-celebrated springtime traditions begins next weekend: Its famed cherry trees are predicted to be in peak bloom.
More than 3,000 of the trees were presented as a gift by the city of Tokyo in 1912. The gesture of international good will has a rich history, but one of its more contentious episodes occurred 80 years ago: the Cherry Tree Rebellion.
The trees had already become a favorite of Washingtonians by 1938, when construction was set to begin on the Jefferson Memorial. The site for the monument was along the Tidal Basin, where many of the trees had been planted.
The planned removal of the trees was opposed by parts of Washington society, in particular by the city’s newspapers. A group of women even briefly chained themselves to a tree on the site in an effort to stop construction.
An exasperated President Franklin D. Roosevelt dismissed the controversy — which died down soon after the memorial’s groundbreaking — as a “flimflam game” designed to sell newspapers.
“If anybody wants to chain herself to the tree and the tree is in the way, we will move the tree and the lady and the chains, and transplant them to some other place,” he said.
