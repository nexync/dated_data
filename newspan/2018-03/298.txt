The “cynical ploy” by Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, to refuse to consider any Supreme Court nominee from President Barack Obama, so as to let Americans “have a voice in the selection” through their votes in the 2016 presidential election, may give rise to the same fate of future attempted appointments.
Judicial appointments have become far too political, something they were never intended to be. As you said, Justice Neil Gorsuch could easily be issuing opinions four decades from now.
I believe that the time has come to limit the term of a Supreme Court justice to 8 to 10 years. At the very least this change would prevent radical political appointees from handing down ultraconservative opinions for possibly 40-plus years.
If we can’t remove politics from political appointments, then we should at the very least place a term limit upon them. But this will require a constitutional amendment.
