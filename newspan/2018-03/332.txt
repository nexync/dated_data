Re “Delta Took a Stand on the N.R.A.; Georgia Lawmakers Want to Make It Pay” (news article, March 2): Wouldn’t it be inspirational if Delta Air Lines offered airfare discounts to high school students planning to travel to Washington to attend the student convocation later this month to press our elected representatives to pass sensible gun legislation? It would give a needed lift to these brave young people, who are doing what adults have lacked the fortitude to do.
It would also be good for business, promoting sales for hundreds of thousands of young people to “fly Delta,” as opposed to the handful of gun advocates who took advantage of the discount to attend the National Rifle Association convention.
The idea could catch on, with other airlines, bus companies and hotel chains offering similar discounts for fares to other cities where students are planning demonstrations on that day.
