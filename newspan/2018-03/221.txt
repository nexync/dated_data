In “ ‘Millennial’ Means Nothing” (Op-Ed, March 7), John Quiggin suggests that the Pew Research Center would do better to eschew generational analysis altogether rather than tighten our definition of millennials. Yet he proceeds to give a number of important examples of the ways in which historical context can have an effect on the collective experiences and values of a generation.
We agree that when it comes to understanding people’s values, behaviors and life outcomes, these generational signals often pale in comparison with other, more fundamental factors like race, class and gender.
We also agree that generational labels quickly become unproductive when they turn into overgeneralized caricatures. But the risk of overgeneralization does not justify ignoring that the social, political, economic and technological context in which one comes of age can have a meaningful effect worthy of studying.
The answer to the public’s desire to understand generational signals is not to silence the conversation but to inform it.
