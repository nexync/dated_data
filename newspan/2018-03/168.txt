• President Trump believes he has settled into the job enough to rely on his instincts rather than on the people who work for him, according to his friends and advisers.
That self-confidence surfaced over the weekend as Mr. Trump abandoned a strategy of showing deference to the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 election. He criticized Robert Mueller and what he characterized as a partisan investigation, leading some Republicans to warn him against shutting down the inquiry.
• Unusually, they responded in kind: “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” Mr. Comey wrote on Twitter, apparently referring to his upcoming book. Others used far harsher language.
• Ever taken a quiz on Facebook?
The social network is again defending its protection of user information after a political data firm harvested private information from more than 50 million profiles. The data was obtained in 2014, when users were paid to take a personality quiz and download an app that scraped information from their profiles and those of their friends.
Lawmakers in the U.S. and Britain are calling for greater scrutiny after a joint examination published over the weekend by The New York Times and The Observer of London. The report explained how the firm, Cambridge Analytica, developed voter-profiling techniques that were used in Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
• Facebook did not inform users whose data had been harvested, and the lack of disclosure could violate laws in Britain and in many American states.
• Black men raised in the U.S., even in the wealthiest families, still earn less in adulthood than white men with similar backgrounds, according to a study that traced the lives of millions of children.
The review, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, found that black and white women from families with comparable earnings had similar individual incomes.
• The research debunks widely held hypotheses about income inequality.
• After Hurricane Harvey swamped the city in August, some residents learned that the flooding in their neighborhood wasn’t an accident.
Homes in Cinco Ranch sat on land that had been designed to flood, as part of a system to protect central Houston — a fact that wasn’t publicized when a developer was allowed to build there.
• Our video follows several families that learned their homes should never have been built in the first place.
Listen to ‘The Daily’: Trump and the F.B.I.
President Trump called the firing of Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy F.B.I. director, a “great day for democracy.” Mr. McCabe says it’s further evidence of efforts to undermine the Russia investigation.

• The N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament included upsets aplenty, with the elimination of five top seeds on Sunday. The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, also lost, after its unprecedented victory over the No. 1 seed Virginia in the first round.
In the women’s tournament, Tennessee was upset in the second round for the second straight year.
• Our reporter Nikole Hannah-Jones notes The Atlantic’s examination of “The Nancy Pelosi Problem,” especially its citation of research (pointed out by the Columbia psychologist Eric Schrimshaw) showing that people reacted positively when a fictional male senator was described as “ambitious” and with “a strong will to power” — but with “moral outrage” when the fictional senator was female.
One of our critics lists 17 performances that stood out at the annual music festival.
A business research organization recently predicted that about one-third of workers in the U.S. will have to switch occupations by 2030 because of automation.
We visited the (partially) automated future at a FedEx facility in North Carolina.
Jefe is a member of FedEx’s new fleet of autonomous robots, purchased to transport large and unwieldy packages around one of the company’s facilities.
We call them “nonconveyable” packages. So think things that are over 60 inches long, widely shaped, not in a cardboard box, over 100 pounds. This allows us to take the people out of that driver position to reallocate them to other places in our building.

— Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, on suggestions that President Trump might fire the special counsel.
In March 1957, when Elvis Presley was 22, he purchased an opulent mansion in Memphis, called Graceland, for just over $100,000.
The land had been owned for generations by the family of S. E. Toof, a newspaper publisher, and it was named after a female relative, Grace. Grace’s niece and her husband built the mansion in 1939.
Mr. Presley installed a pool with a jukebox nearby, hosted friends and relatives, and created a “Jungle Room” with green carpets and a Polynesian theme.
After struggling with ill health and prescription drug abuse, he died of a heart attack at Graceland on Aug. 16, 1977, and is buried there. He was 42. Read his Times obituary here.
Five years later, Graceland opened to the public and became one of the country’s most popular tourist destinations (the address is 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard). Many visit yearly for the anniversary of his death.
Last year, just before the 40th anniversary, Graceland underwent a $140 million expansion, including a large hotel and entertainment complex. You can take a virtual tour here.
