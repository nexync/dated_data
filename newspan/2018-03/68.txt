A COLONY IN A NATION, by Chris Hayes. (Norton, $15.95.) Hayes, a white journalist for MSNBC, draws on his childhood growing up in the Bronx to explore race, subjugation and power. He frames his discussion around what he sees as two “distinct regimes” in the United States: “In the Nation, you have rights,” he writes. “In the Colony, you have commands.” His analysis draws on the country’s colonial roots to expose what he sees as a founding hypocrisy: White colonists fought for independence — and the right to subjugate others.
