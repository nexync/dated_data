PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — It was fish for breakfast and fish for lunch and fish for dinner.
“I hate fish,” Khan Hin said.
Mr. Hin’s palate is American. His vernacular, slang from the streets of Stockton, Calif., is American.
And his family’s experience is all too American. His older sister was at school in Stockton in 1989 when a man sprayed gunfire on the schoolyard. Five children ages 6 to 9, all of Cambodian or Vietnamese heritage, were killed. Nearly 30 others, including Mr. Hin’s sister, were injured. The killer had repeatedly spewed hatred of Asian immigrants.
At the hospital, Mr. Hin’s sister got to meet Michael Jackson, which was an American dream of sorts, although it wasn’t worth two bullets in her body.
While President Trump has brought renewed attention to the fate of legal and illegal immigrants alike, deportations of Cambodians began in 2002, when the government of Cambodia signed a repatriation agreement with the Bush administration. So far, around 600 legal permanent residents of Cambodian descent have been deported from the United States, many directly from prison.
