It is 7:15 p.m. I am at the grocery store closest to my home on the East Side. I am thinking of dinner. I am thinking of work. I am wondering what I should buy and what I should eat. They are not always the same.
I’m lost in my mind as I work things out. I hear a voice. I’m not sure if it is speaking to me, or simply an open-ended query.
I never talk to strangers, but I am compelled to respond.
She sighs and thanks me for my honesty. We both laugh, half heartily, half hesitantly.
I move on to the spinach, and to thinking: We are two people in millions in New York City. We are crossing paths on our separate ways home. We probably never would have spoken. We will probably never speak again.
I never even saw her eyes. It is Monday. The sun set at 5:43 p.m. today. I caught some of it on my way home.
I will not have an avocado later. Perfectly ripe avocados are hard to find.
