The ABC family sitcom “black-ish” has not been shy about plunging into difficult and controversial issues, like the 2016 election, racial slurs and police brutality. But a recent politically charged episode was pulled after a dispute between the network and Kenya Barris, the show’s creator.
“Given our creative differences, neither ABC nor I were happy with the direction of the episode and mutually agreed not to air it,” Mr. Barris said in a statement.
The episode, titled “Please, Baby, Please,” was slated to air on Feb. 27 but was replaced by a rerun. According to Variety, the episode centers on Dre (Anthony Anderson) telling an improvised bedtime story to his infant son that touches on social and political issues in the United States, including a debate over the right of athletes to kneel during the national anthem.
“One of the things that has always made ‘black-ish’ so special is how it deftly examines delicate social issues in a way that simultaneously entertains and educates,” a network representative said in a statement to Variety. “However, on this episode there were creative differences we were unable to resolve.” ABC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Television episodes being pulled off the air is rare but not unheard-of. Last year, a Donald Trump-inspired episode of “Law & Order: SVU” was shelved. Mass shootings and other tragedies like the Boston Marathon bombing have also caused shows to delay, alter or cancel episodes.
“black-ish” is in its fourth season. The show has drawn solid ratings, earned Emmy nominations and led to a spinoff, “grown-ish,” airing on Freeform.
