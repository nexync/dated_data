The World War I drama “Journey’s End” is an old-fashioned movie from a well-worn source, the play by R.C. Sherriff, who fought in the war himself. The first movie version, directed by James Whale with Colin Clive, opened in 1930, a year before their immortal work in “Frankenstein.” The new film’s air of stodgy nobility resembles that of “The Four Feathers” (1939), one of many movies for which Mr. Sherriff wrote the screenplay.
The scene is 1918 in the north of France. British units take turns rotating into the front lines, where a German attack is imminent. A newcomer, Raleigh (Asa Butterfield), has pushed to serve under Captain Stanhope (Sam Claflin), his sister’s sweetheart, danger notwithstanding. Osborne (Paul Bettany), a father figure in the company who insists that the men call him “uncle,” warns Raleigh that he’ll find the shell-shocked Stanhope changed.
Yet early screen depictions of World War I, like “The Big Parade” and “All Quiet on the Western Front,” show more passion and visual invention. A rattling sound design and the cinematographer Laurie Rose’s excellent use of low light aren’t enough to make the experience immediate.
