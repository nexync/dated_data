Ms. Prats, 52, of East Harlem, then tied her purple ribbon to one of the many handrails and short birch trees outside of the Church of the Epiphany, an age-old Roman Catholic church in Gramercy Park, joining thousands of others before her who, for the last four weeks, have turned the church’s outside plaza into a public display of deeply felt love and loss.
The sentiments varied in subject, with most concerning hardship on a more personal level. “Please keep my father safe and alive during his upcoming heart surgeries,” one read; another said, “I hope my grandmother gets better every day.” Several others addressed the anguish of the daily news cycle. “I pray for the victims of the Parkland shooting,” someone wrote. “To the lives lost in Syria,” said another.
The ribbons were the idea of the Rev. James Mayzik, who arrived at the church in September from Fairfield, Conn. There, he had asked his congregants to do something they weren’t used to: write down personal prayers — ones that went beyond broad calls for world peace — on a small piece of paper and hand them to him.
On Easter Sunday, Father Mayzik plans to tie different colored ribbons around a large cross in the plaza’s center and leave them up for 50 days. He hopes to preserve the prayers in some way, he said, and return next year with more.
Karen Bettilyon slowly strolled through the plaza on her way out of services on Friday, reading as many ribbons as she could.
One, written by a child, asked for students and teacher to be safe from gun violence, she said. Another prayed for the families in Puerto Rico who were still struggling in the wake of Hurricane Maria.
Visiting her daughter from Chicago, Ms. Bettilyon, 57, said she had looked for a service to attend for Good Friday, but had not known about the “prayer plaza” at the Church of the Epiphany beforehand.
