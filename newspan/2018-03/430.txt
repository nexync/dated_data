“I would think it would tarnish,” Ms. Moreno, 86, told Ryan Seacrest, who was hosting the red carpet broadcast for E!
Ms. Moreno — a Puerto Rican who is one of just 12 people to hold an EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) — said the skirt was made from a single piece of obi fabric, which is traditionally used to construct kimonos.
The dress, which was created in Manila, was made strapless for Sunday’s event. 
“Wait till you see what I’m wearing!!!” Ms. Moreno tweeted late last month.
Ms. Moreno now stars in the television show “One Day at a Time,” a reboot of the 1970s-’80s Norman Lear sitcom of the same name. In January at the Golden Globes, Ms. Moreno made another notable entrance, cruising down the red carpet on a red scooter with Mr. Lear at the helm.
