Facilitating trips to Nazi concentration camps for German students is unquestionably a powerful educational tool that can greatly deepen their comprehension of one of the most tragic chapters in their countryâ€™s history.
And there is hope that the anti-Semitism and neo-Nazism festering in Europe today can be combated by enlightening young Germans about what happened just over 70 years ago.
By empowering them to get a firsthand look at the eternal memorials to the millions who perished, we are opening their eyes to the devastation and destruction that unadulterated bigotry and religious intolerance leave in their wake.
Not only would it be social malpractice if German lawmakers fail to collectively support these educational outings, but it would also be an abdication of their responsibility to the German leaders of tomorrow, their children.
