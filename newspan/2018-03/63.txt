• U.N.-backed chemical weapons experts are due to visit Britain today to analyze the nerve agent, Novichok, used in a recent attack on a former Russian double agent and his daughter. Above, police officers at the site.
Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has expelled 23 Russian diplomats, and Russia has retaliated in kind. But, no surprise, Vladimir Putin won a fourth term as president. Below, he addressed a rally celebrating his annexation of Crimea.
• Brexit woes.
An influential committee of British lawmakers says the country should seek to postpone its exit from the European Union if talks drag on during the next few months.
Meanwhile, Britain’s strained National Health Service is paying French doctors to perform some operations on its behalf. The irony is painfully obvious to those who remember how the Brexit vote was won partly on a misleading promise by politicians that leaving the bloc would free up 350 million pounds (about $490 million) each week to fund the N.H.S.
• In a Twitter storm, President Trump accused Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, of filling his team with partisans, after Mr. Mueller sought documents related to the Trump Organization’s Russian connections.
It’s another sign that the president may try to fire Mr. Mueller — and that he’s beginning to dismiss his advisers’ guidance in favor of his own instincts.
• Facebook is under fire in Britain and the U.S.
A collaboration between our reporters and The Observer of London showed that a firm specializing in the new field of psychological voter-profiling used private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users, taken without their permission.
The firm and its American arm were players in the campaigns for both Brexit and the presidency of Donald Trump. Above, one of our sources.
Facebook banned the American arm — Cambridge Analytica, financed by the hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer and championed by the now-exiled Trump adviser Stephen Bannon — after we began asking questions.
• Democracy rising.
Voters across Europe are gravitating toward illiberal populists. But Slovakia appears to be bucking the trend, our correspondent writes.
Protests recently forced the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Fico, and they have shown little sign of abating as young demonstrators — whose parents lived under Communism — appear determined to safeguard hard-won freedoms.
Watch our video on the public outcry.
That’s the nickname for Jean-Marie Le Pen, above, the patriarch of France’s far right. His unrepentant extremism led his own daughter, Marine, to kick him out of the country’s far-right National Front party.
But his memoir, “Son of the Nation,” is now a best seller.
Our correspondent spent time with Mr. Le Pen, who is nearly 90, at a gloomy old mansion in the Paris suburbs he inherited from a backer.
• China named Yi Gang, above, an American-educated economist, as its new central bank chief. The move came two days after Xi Jinping began a new term as president.
• Russian money has deep roots in British life, including in the Premier League, one of Britain’s key cultural exports. That could complicate any efforts by the British government to target the London assets of Russian oligarchs.
• The smuggling of U.S. technological secrets is outpacing Cold War levels, American experts and officials say — and China, Iran, North Korea and Russia are behind it.

In March 1957, when Elvis Presley was 22, he purchased an opulent mansion in Memphis, called Graceland, for just over $100,000.
The land had been owned by the S. E. Toof family for generations, and it was named for one of the female relatives, Grace. Grace’s niece and her husband built the mansion in 1939. Above, Mr. Presley with Yvonne Lime at Graceland around 1957.
Mr. Presley installed a pool with a jukebox nearby, hosted friends and relatives and created a “Jungle Room” with green shag carpets and a Polynesian theme.
After struggling with ill health and prescription drug abuse, he died of a heart attack at Graceland on Aug. 16, 1977, and is buried there. He was 42. Read his Times obituary here.
Five years later, Graceland opened to the public and became one of the country’s most popular tourist destinations, drawing visitors from around the globe. Many visit yearly (the address is 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard) to mark the anniversary of his death.
Last year, just before the 40th anniversary, Graceland underwent a $140 million expansion, including a large hotel and entertainment complex. You can take a virtual tour here.
