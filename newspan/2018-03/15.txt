• President Trump signed off on tough tariffs on steel and aluminum, promising to be “very flexible” after facing a global outcry.
Mr. Trump suggested some allies, including Canada, Mexico and Australia, might be spared. But some nations aren’t taking any chances. A group of 11 — including Australia, New Zealand and Japan — signed a broad free trade deal in a direct challenge to Mr. Trump’s protectionist agenda.
And our news podcast, “The Daily,” examines Mr. Trump’s claims about tariffs and trade deficits.
President Trump said that protections on steel and aluminum imports were in the interest of national security. But could the threat be the tariffs themselves?
• China is all but certain this weekend to throw out a 1982 rule that has restricted the country’s presidents to two five-year terms. The beneficiary, President Xi Jinping, could be in power for life.
To position himself for this moment, our correspondent writes, Mr. Xi “deployed speed, secrecy and intimidation to smother potential opposition inside and outside the party.” Here’s a look at Mr. Xi’s rise to power.
Despite the display of support, murmurings of opposition suggest that Mr. Xi and his subordinates have not fully sold the idea to a broader public. Such stirrings of discontent, our Beijing correspondents write, could build over time.

Militias Are Burning Villages in Congo. We Tracked the Toll.
We obtained satellite images that show how lakeshore villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been destroyed in recent attacks, forcing 140,000 people to flee their homes.
In a remote corner of the Democratic Republic of Congo, armed militias are burning villages. Scores of people have been killed, and over 100,000 have been displaced. It’s often hard to tell what’s going on in distant parts of the world. But by using satellite data, we can monitor this conflict in almost real time and detect flare-ups that may indicate violence is starting to spread. What we’re seeing doesn’t look good. This was the scene in western Uganda in February: waves of refugees fleeing violence in the D.R.C. and crossing Lake Albert. “At the height there were between five and a half and six thousand people coming across per day.” Andrew Harper was on the shore. “They grabbed everything that they owned, which was basically nothing, and they brought it with them on the boat. All these very clear signs were indicative that whole areas had been basically cleansed.” The refugees said that armed men had burned houses, forcing entire villages to flee across the lake, most to the town of Sebagoro. Many came from here, in Ituri Province. But the scale of the violence was unclear. So we analyzed aerial data. NASA satellites captured the locations of active fires every day, and many were burning on the days that people fled. Now, most were probably forest fires, not acts of violence. So we used OpenStreetMap data to pinpoint populated areas and obtained new high-resolution satellite pictures of those villages. They tell a clear story. Here’s one village photographed before the violence began, and the same village on Feb. 17. Nearly every structure is burned. This pattern emerged in village after village, all along the lake shore. Humanitarian groups estimate that more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed. Now, while satellite data gives us a clearer picture of the unrest, Ituri’s history helps us understand why the violence has suddenly erupted at this time. In the early 2000s, two communities, the Hema and the Lendu, were involved in a bloody conflict. More than 50,000 people were killed before peace was restored. “Why this currently is happening now is fairly suspicious. These communities were reconciling. Relationships had improved.” Stearns says that this time, it’s not ethnic tensions, but political motivations that are most likely driving the conflict. “The country has been in a period of political turmoil as President Joseph Kabila fights for his political survival. It is one of, unfortunately, many, many different, often interlocking conflicts.” More recently, the violence in Ituri has spread inland. “The situation has escalated, with figures of displacement basically doubling in a week.” Our reporting suggests that after the lakeshore villagers fled, the violence spilled over this mountain ridge, driving people westward, many toward the town of Bunia. “Up to 100,000 people are displaced in the Ituri province. This is probably not a very good sign.” So, while it’s unclear what’s stoking this violence, it’s troubling how suddenly it flared. And for the many displaced, who knows when, or even if, they’ll be able to return home?
• The U.S. secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is on a five-nation tour of Africa, warning against Chinese investment and wearing a tight smile when asked about President Trump’s insulting description of the continent.
Separately, in our latest visual investigation, we show how villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been destroyed in recent attacks, forcing 140,000 people to flee.
This Times Insider piece explains how we used active-fire data from NASA and Openstreetmap to bring the atrocities to light.
That’s how one woman summed up the mood on International Women’s Day, which was marked with a sense of urgency this year, in the era of #MeToo and Time’s Up.
At The Times, we unveiled a project, “Overlooked,” that starts with the stories of 15 remarkable women who did not receive a Times obituary.
The names are surprising: Sylvia Plath, Ida B. Wells, the Bollywood legend Madhubala and Qui Jin, China’s Joan of Arc.

President Trump has recently conducted a series of televised conversations with lawmakers as well as with regular citizens.
Forty-one years ago, President Jimmy Carter held a similar unscripted discussion, answering questions from callers during a live radio broadcast from the Oval Office.
Mr. Cronkite invited listeners to call the White House at 900‐242‐1611. According to CBS, more than 9 million Americans tried.
Some of the dozens of questions that Mr. Carter answered were distinctively of the late 1970s: about the gas tax, Mr. Carter’s pardoning of draft dodgers in Vietnam and the early days of the U.S. space shuttle program.
Others — about tax overhaul, drug abuse and relations with Cuba — still resonate today.
One caller asked why members of Congress were getting a $12,000 raise while Mr. Carter was proposing that taxpayers receive a rebate of only $50.
“Gerald, that is a hard question for me to answer,” Mr. Carter replied.
The program caught the public’s attention (“Saturday Night Live” ran a spoof the next week), but it was never repeated.
