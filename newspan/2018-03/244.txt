This week is the anniversary of the birth of Gabriel García Márquez, the Colombian novelist, who was affectionately known as Gabo in Latin America.
Born on March 6, 1927, García Márquez defined the writing style known as magical realism, but his escapades in real life were just as noteworthy.
He started his career as a journalist, at one point enraging the Colombian dictator Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla so much that García Márquez fled to Europe for two years.
He became such close friends with Fidel Castro that he would show the Cuban leader drafts of his unpublished books.
At one point, he vowed never to write as long as the Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet remained in power (a promise that was broken long before Pinochet’s 17-year reign ended).
And after being denied a U.S. visa for more than three decades, García Márquez arrived in America in 1995, at the invitation of President Bill Clinton.
Before García Márquez died in 2014, a friend said the title of the author’s memoir summed up his life. “All his motivation is contained in that title, ‘To Live to Tell It’ — it is the pleasure of telling the story,” said the friend, Jaime Abello.
