2,968 — The Angels’ Albert Pujols, with 614 career home runs, would join Willie Mays, Hank Aaron and Alex Rodriguez as the only players in history with 600 home runs and 3,000 hits.
After spending most of his career at third base and winning three Gold Glove awards, Machado will move to shortstop, a position he played in the minors.
When shortstop J.J. Hardy was out with an injury in 2016, Machado started 43 games at short, but only played third base last season.
The only player to win Gold Gloves at two infield positions is Placido Polanco, who won at second base (2007, 2009) and third base (2011).
After starting 502 games at second base (and 149 at short) during his career with the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Miami Marlins, Gordon is making the move to the outfield.
He is a two-time National League All-Star with a Gold Glove with the Marlins in 2015, but Seattle is set at second base with Robinson Cano.
The only player to win Gold Gloves as an infielder and outfielder is Darin Erstad, who won Gold Gloves as an outfielder in 2000 and 2002 and as a first baseman in 2004, all with the Anaheim Angels.
Jose Altuve, Houston — Four consecutive seasons with 200 base hits. From 2014 through 2017, Altuve has collected 845 hits; Charlie Blackmon of the Colorado Rockies is second with 747. Altuve has also stolen at least 30 bases six straight seasons.
Edwin Encarnacion, Cleveland — Six consecutive seasons with 30 home runs. He has the most home runs in baseball, 231, during that stretch.
Nolan Arenado, Colorado — Three consecutive seasons with at least 35 home runs, 130 runs batted in and 350 totals bases.
Max Scherzer, Washington — Six straight seasons with 200 strikeouts, and five consecutive seasons with 200 innings pitched.
Chris Sale, Boston — Five consecutive seasons with 200 strikeouts.
Jeff Samardzija, San Francisco — Five straight seasons with 200 innings pitched.
With the acquisition of Giancarlo Stanton, the Yankees now have the only two players who hit at least 50 home runs last season in their lineup. Aaron Judge became the first rookie to hit 50 (he finished with 52), and Stanton led the majors with 59 as a Miami Marlin.
