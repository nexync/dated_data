The “we” in “What We Started” are the demigods of electronic dance music — the people who liked EDM before EDM was cool. In this documentary, directed by Bert Marcus and Cyrus Saidi, they gush about the genre’s milestones and metaphorically high-five one another while trying not to bore the uninitiated into a drugless stupor.
That’s a tricky balancing act. “What We Started” appears to have been conceived with contradictory audiences in mind. On one hand, it tries to present an accessible history of electronic music, starting with its outgrowth from disco, house and techno and continuing through its commercialization and fusion with pop. On the other hand, a subcultural cliquishness creeps into the movie. If you already know all these names and have bought your tickets to Ultra Music Festival, for which “What We Started” could double as a promotion, dig in.
The aesthetic debates recall the axiom that the bitterest fights have the smallest stakes. We learn about how D.J.s who play prerecorded sets from USB sticks have it too easy and hear arguments about the artistic differences between mass audience EDM and its underground progenitor. An interlude on drug enforcement’s approach to the scene briefly puts the party on hold.
For generational contrast, the movie focuses on the British D.J. Carl Cox and the Dutch wunderkind Martin Garrix. A late scene in which they swap notes makes for a vaguely moving torch-passing. It’s a rare moment in “What We Started” that doesn’t treat outsiders like bystanders at a rave.
