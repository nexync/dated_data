A Girl Scouts troop established in February at a homeless shelter in Queens will expand to 14 additional shelters throughout New York City and is expected to serve about 500 girls.
With a portrait of Alexander Hamilton as a backdrop, Karina, Sanaa, Christina, Nayalynn and Tanae — ages 5 to 11 — talked about the troop’s origins, its expansion and what the Girl Scouts meant to them.
“Now more girls just like me will be able to participate and get the same,” she said.
The New York Times is using only the girls’ first names to protect their privacy.
Troop 6000 has 27 members, who live with their families in a budget hotel that was converted into shelter space in Long Island City. Although the troop came together under difficult circumstances, the members’ stories have resonated with city officials and donors around the world. The publicity has helped bring attention to the plight of the city’s homeless children, who make up nearly 40 percent of the shelter system in New York.
Ms. Burgess, a single mother of five children, including Karina and Christina, became homeless last year after her rental building was sold to make way for condominiums. Ms. Burgess, a community engagement specialist at the Girl Scouts of Greater New York, asked her employer whether it would be possible to create a troop at the shelter.
Her request came at the same time that Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, a Queens Democrat, and officials within the Girl Scouts and the Department of Homeless Services were looking for a way to bring the program to homeless girls.
“I hope that you know this and feel this: that what you’ve done is so powerful and so important in changing our city for the better,” Mr. Van Bramer said.
