SEOUL, South Korea — For two years, from a cramped office in central Seoul, activists and volunteers from five countries have been doing something never tried before: creating interactive maps of places where North Korea is thought to have executed and buried prisoners.
The group said North Koreans were executed for such crimes as smuggling mushrooms to China, stealing copper from factories, distributing South Korean dramas, human trafficking and “a slip of the tongue,” usually a reference to criticism of the government.
It said public executions took place most often between 1994 and 2000, during which North Korea struggled to control its people, who were suffering in a nationwide famine.
