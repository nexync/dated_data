Every summer we take a group of incoming student leaders away for a few days. As part of the experience, we rise at 5 a.m. to visit a Cistercian monastery where a group of monks live in almost complete silence, pursuing a lifestyle that has not changed much since the 11th century. Young people find this commitment utterly confronting. It is far more outrageous to them than any possible expression of sexuality.
The monks follow “The Rule of St. Benedict,” written in the sixth century, one of the more wise and humane works in Western history. It begins with the invitation “Listen carefully, my son, to the master’s instructions, and attend to them with the ear of your heart. This is advice from a father who loves you.” The writer Flannery O’Connor — a woman of few but well-chosen words — was sustained by this austere and beautiful tradition. Thomas Merton was a Cistercian, too. His great book “The Sign of Jonas” ends with a piece written in the heat of summer of 1952 called “Fire Watch,” a meditation on sleep, silence, prayer and community. Coco Chanel spent her adolescence in the orphanage of a Cistercian abbey; Chanel No. 5 has always struck me as an ineffable combination of silence and sex.
