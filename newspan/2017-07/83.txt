In April, the activist hedge fund Jana Partners noisily declared itself an investor in Whole Foods Market and demanded that the grocery chain consider selling itself.
Now, after Whole Foods announced a $13.4 billion deal to sell itself to Amazon, the investment firm is declaring victory — and selling its holdings.
Jana disclosed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it sold off its roughly 8.2 percent stake in the grocery chain over the past month. The hedge fund began selling its holdings on June 19, but got rid of the bulk of its stake, 16 million shares, on Tuesday.
All told, the firm sold its Whole Foods shares for an average price of about $42.87 — or roughly 39 percent more than the price before the activist investor revealed its stake.
In selling all its holdings, Jana signaled that it did not expect anyone else to surpass Amazon’s takeover bid of $42 a share in cash.
Based on securities filings, Jana appeared to make a profit of roughly $305 million on its trade.
That amounts to a healthy, and quick, return for Jana, an activist hedge fund founded by Barry Rosenstein in 2001. Jana has acquired stakes in a wide range of companies, like Tiffany & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
When the investment firm began its campaign to shake up Whole Foods in April, the activist demanded four seats on the grocer’s board, as well as other changes to the company’s strategy.
Jana’s 8.2 percent stake made the hedge fund one of Whole Foods’ biggest investors.
But the firm’s campaign did little to endear itself to Whole Foods’ co-founder and chief executive, John Mackey, who derided Jana as greedy investors out to make a quick profit.
