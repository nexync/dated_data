A Yiddish-language feature made with nonprofessional actors on the streets of Brooklyn? Joshua Z. Weinstein’s “Menashe” is not the product of a time machine but the belated rebirth of a venerable tradition.
Their audience was large. Before World War II, many millions spoke the common language of Eastern European Jews. Since then, the number of speakers has dropped to several hundred thousand — mostly ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jews and a few devoted Yiddishists.
But, as portended by the supernatural prologue of Joel and Ethan Coen’s comic horror film, “A Serious Man” (2009), the 21st century has brought Yiddish back to life onscreen — with a difference. Never the audience for Yiddish films, the Hasidim, who typically shun popular entertainment, have now become its subject.
In 2005, Yakov and Mendy Kirsh, two ultra-Orthodox brothers from Monsey, N.Y., made a low-budget thriller, “A Gesheft” (“The Deal”), with an all-male cast. This was followed in 2011 by Eve Annenberg’s quite different “Romeo and Juliet in Yiddish,” a clever transposition of Shakespeare featuring a cast of young apostate Hasidim.
