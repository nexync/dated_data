‘The Daily’: A Day With I.C.E.
Every day from before sunrise until late into the night, undocumented immigrants across the United States are being picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, the front-line soldiers in President Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
Increasingly, the arrests are collateral: Officers detain people they come across while looking for somebody else.
My colleague Jennifer Medina recently spent a day in the field with immigration officers in California who are enforcing the president’s new policies, and documented their encounter with the Delgado family.
More from Ms. Medina’s day with I.C.E., including photographs and video.
