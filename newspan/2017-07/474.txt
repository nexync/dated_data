1932 | I’m Not ‘Mrs. Putnam.’ I’m Amelia Earhart.
The $500 given to her by The New York Times was a godsend, Amelia Earhart allowed. And the orchids sent by Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, the grande dame of The Times, were simply lovely.
But after navigating the Atlantic Ocean alone in May 1932 — to the world’s acclaim — the aviator had a bone to pick with us.
Ms. Earhart had been “Miss Earhart” when she crossed the Atlantic in 1928 as a passenger — the first woman to make a transoceanic journey by air. Her personal account of that thrilling adventure was cabled exclusively to The New York Times from Burry Port in Wales.
After she married Mr. Putnam in 1931, she became “Mrs. Putnam” in headlines, including the one trumpeting her triumphant solo journey across the ocean.
She objected publicly to the practice of being identified by her husband’s name, as The Times itself reported a month later, when she asked journalists please to use her flying name.
Times editors initially seemed deaf to her request.
Sometimes, however, writing to a publisher can get results.

In 1937, it was “Miss Earhart” who was forced down at sea. The circumstances of her disappearance still elude any certain conclusions, though the 80th anniversary has renewed speculation and searches.
Here at The Times, the intrigue no longer concerns “Mrs. Putnam” or “Miss Earhart” but “Ms. Earhart” — an honorific that owes its resuscitation to Sheila Michaels, who died June 22.
This time, perhaps, Amelia Earhart would not object.
