After Minneapolis Police Shooting, Many Ask: Why Wasn’t Body Camera On?
State investigators have said that a camera on the squad car was also not turned on, and that the officers’ body cameras were not activated until after the shooting. A lawyer for Officer Noor did not return an email seeking comment.
Last week, days before Ms. Damond’s shooting, a Minneapolis television station, using a snapshot of data from March, reported that body camera usage in the Minneapolis Police Department appeared to be minimal. Records showed that on average, officers each uploaded five or six hours of video footage for the entire month.
In Ms. Damond’s case, the lack of body camera footage is concerning, said Teresa Nelson, the interim executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota.
After the shooting, three days went by without an explanation from officials. Ms. Damond’s grieving family and friends demanded an answer: What reason could Officer Noor have had for shooting her?
“I had no evidence about how they were using the body cameras, but I know that there weren’t specific structures in place to make sure they were using the cameras in accordance with policy,” Ms. Singleton said.
