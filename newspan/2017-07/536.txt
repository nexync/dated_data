Richard Atkins was at the beginning of a promising musical career — until a single disastrous performance changed the course of his life.
This film recounts the rise, fall and ultimate second coming of the talented psychedelic folk musician Richard Atkins. In 1968, Atkins was building toward success he was certain would approach that of the Byrds or Simon & Garfunkel. He’d won a contract with Mercury Records, and recorded with the Wrecking Crew, a group of Los Angeles session musicians famous for their work with the Beach Boys.
But stage fright triggered a disastrous make-or-break performance in a small Hollywood nightclub, and everything abruptly fell apart. Atkins gave up music in the prime, and for 50 years he refused even to listen to a radio, so painful were his memories of a career he was convinced could have been. His story became a narrative of failure, but without the happy ending we generally like to document.
In this film, he explains how resilience and talent took him far, but ultimately found their limit. And he shows that the same twists of fate in life that lead us to success can ruin us at any point. In their wake, we are left to romanticize the potential of what could have been.
But this tale has a third act. Atkins, now 68, has decided to give performing a second try. And he is confronting once more a fear of the stage that has haunted him for most of his life.
I met Atkins several years ago after my father was impressed by his performance at an open mic night and introduced us; perhaps his bittersweet story, coupled with the mournful tone of his music, could make for a meaningful film. Like most people today, I’d never heard of Atkins’s only album, “Richard Twice” (named for Atkins and his bandmate Richard Manning). But when I heard the songs, all but lost to history, I loved them and felt others would too.
So we decided to tell his story, as much about his beautiful music and resilience as it is about acceptance, both of your past and where it took you. To simply be all right with what happened.
