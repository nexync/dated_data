Shortly after President Trump arrived in France on Friday for an official visit, he took a moment to tell the country’s first lady, Brigitte Macron, what he thought of her physical appearance.
“Beautiful,” Mr. Trump said, turning to the first lady of France. She appeared to grab Mr. Trump’s wife, Melania, by the arm and take a step backward. Mrs. Trump stood next to her, smiling.
The encounter happened during a tour of the Hôtel National des Invalides, a museum complex in central Paris that houses the tomb of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was broadcast live on a Facebook video stream on Mr. Macron’s official Facebook account. A clip of the episode soon spread widely online and in the news media.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly commented publicly on the physical appearance of women he has encountered either as a presidential candidate or as president — including the comedian Rosie O’Donnell and, now, the first lady of France.
Earlier in June, Mr. Trump interrupted an Oval Office phone call with the prime minister of Ireland, Leo Varadkar, to comment on the physical appearance of Caitriona Perry, a Washington correspondent for Ireland’s national broadcaster.
Mr. and Mrs. Trump are in France to celebrate Bastille Day, the French national holiday, and to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the American entry into World War I, a conflict largely fought on French soil.
