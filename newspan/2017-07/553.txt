The new study indicating that 12 billion metric tons of plastic will be present on Earth by 2050 is alarming confirmation of what we have seen on our beaches and in our oceans for years.
With between 5 million and 13 million metric tons of plastic entering the ocean each year, beaches are the front line of the fight against plastic pollution: Plastic bags, straws, bottles and packaging collect while threatening our health, the planet and future generations.
Here in California, voters recently chose to uphold the country’s first statewide plastic bag ban. In New York City, local representatives passed a law that placed a 5-cent fee on all plastic bags, but the ban didn’t last long.
The New York Legislature passed a law to block the city law and place a moratorium on any new city bag-fee legislation until 2018, part of a disturbing national trend of states pre-empting local government efforts to address plastic pollution.
With these new numbers on plastic pollution in hand, I hope that legislators across the country will see that we cannot wait another day to start solving this crisis.
