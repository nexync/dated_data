A British court ruled on Monday that Britain’s extensive sales of arms to Saudi Arabia are legal, rejecting claims by rights groups that the Saudis have violated international law by using those weapons to kill civilians in Yemen’s civil war.
The decision by London’s High Court was praised by Prime Minister Theresa May, who told Parliament that the ruling vindicated the government’s position that it strictly enforces the export of arms, the British news media reported.
But groups including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and Oxfam denounced the ruling, saying the court had ignored evidence that the Saudis have devastated Yemen’s civilian population with indiscriminate attacks.
A Saudi-led coalition has been bombing and blockading Yemen since March 2015 to help rout Houthi insurgents backed by Iran. The Houthis control large parts of the country, including the capital, Sana.
The war in Yemen has killed at least 10,000 people, displaced millions, led to an economic collapse and left many in danger of famine. It has also contributed to a cholera outbreak that by Monday had sickened more than 300,000 people, according to the Red Cross.
In dismissing the coalition’s claim, the court ruled that Britain’s Defense Ministry had access to a “wider and more sophisticated range of information” and that the Saudis had “sought positively to address concerns” that they respect international law.
