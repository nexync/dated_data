I can say that after 40 years nursing continues to be a fulfilling profession, and my wife agrees. My son, my soon-to-be son-in-law and my nephew value their decision to become nurses, as do their spouses.
Men should look at nursing as a career choice that provides security while offering a continuously rewarding opportunity in specialties like palliative, primary, trauma and critical care, where nurses ease suffering and make a true difference in people’s lives.

Here is the perspective of a wife who is actually married to a male nurse.
My husband exudes masculinity when I watch him work in the emergency department. He is a thinker, a leader and a doer. He embraces his role and title as a registered nurse. Luckily, so do other men in nursing.
My husband left his job in corporate America to pursue a career in nursing. Not for the money, although he makes well over $100,000 a year, but to come home every day knowing that he saved a life.
Nurses care for people in their most vulnerable states, while solving problems, acting quickly under extreme pressure and thinking outside the box.
I’m proud of my husband — my husband, the nurse.
