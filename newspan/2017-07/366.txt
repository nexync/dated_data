New York|A Touchy Topic?
It was spring 2013, and I was an assistant in publishing, walking into my very first book launch party. It was at a swanky apartment in SoHo, with marble floors and a doorman who directed me to the elevator.
The doors had barely shut when an older man with distinctive features rushed into the elevator. He apologized for delaying me. I gawked in reply.
We got off on the same floor, and quickly I lost him in the crowd.
“I know,” I said. After all, I was in the book business.
I passed the time with the other assistants, loading up on free cheese and wine, pretending not to be in awe. We stood dutifully in a corner, so as not to get in the way of anyone important.
I pointed out the man from the elevator.
“I wrote my senior thesis on his most notorious novel,” I said. I decided to approach him, and the other assistants were quick to offer advice.
The wine had other ideas. When he was alone at the bar, I excused myself and marched over to him. I hovered until he turned to me, kind but expectant.
