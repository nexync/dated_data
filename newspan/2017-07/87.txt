Joseph Rago, a 34-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial writer for The Wall Street Journal, was found dead at his home on Thursday evening. Police officers discovered Mr. Rago’s body at his apartment in Manhattan at around 8 p.m. after a request to check on him, a spokeswoman for the New York Police Department said.
Mr. Gigot had notified the newspaper’s security officials after Mr. Rago did not appear at work on Thursday, according to an article published on The Journal’s website on Friday. The officials then contacted the police.
Foul play is not suspected, the police spokeswoman said.
Mr. Rago, a graduate of Dartmouth College, won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing in 2011 “for his well crafted, against-the-grain editorials challenging the health care reform advocated by President Obama,” his citation said.
Mr. Rago’s death was met with an outpouring of grief inside and outside The Journal newsroom, which he had joined as an intern in 2005.
