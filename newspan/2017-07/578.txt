France is joining a growing movement to force the extinction of vehicles that run on fossil fuels, saying on Thursday that it would aim to end the sale of gasoline and diesel cars by 2040.
The target is less ambitious than ones set by countries like Norway and India. Still, coming from a major car-producing country, Franceâ€™s declaration gave additional momentum to efforts to fight climate change and urban smog by promoting the use of electric cars.
