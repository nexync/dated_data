Eon and MGM also said that the script would be written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who have teamed up on the screenplays for the last six Bond installments, starting with “The World Is Not Enough” in 1999. The next Bond movie — the 25th in the series, if you exclude “Never Say Never Again” from 1983, which was made by an outside production company — will be produced by Eon’s Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli.
