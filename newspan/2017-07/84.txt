Mandy Patinkin is returning to Broadway. The Tony-winning actor will assume the lead male role in “Natasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812” for three weeks, from Aug. 15 through Sept. 3. He’ll take over from the “Hamilton” alumnus Okieriete Onaodowan in a show that picked up 12 Tony nominations and continues to perform strongly at the box office.
“The Great Comet,” Dave Malloy’s musical adaptation of a portion of Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” was highly celebrated when it arrived at the Imperial Theater last fall. “It is both the most innovative and the best new musical to open on Broadway since ‘Hamilton,’” Charles Isherwood wrote in a review in The New York Times. The show’s accolades included Tony nominations for Denée Benton and Josh Groban, the actors in the lead roles, and Tony Awards for scenic design and lighting design, in June.
Mr. Patinkin, 64, will inherit Mr. Groban’s role of Pierre, a hard-drinking, bitter aristocrat who plays piano and accordion onstage.
