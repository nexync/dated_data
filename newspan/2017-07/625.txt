Good morning on this muggy Monday.
We’ll be checking back in with our respondents to see if they’ve followed through on their summer goals. Tell us about your plans in the comments.
It should be clear and sunny for the morning commute, but watch out for showers around lunchtime.
The afternoon will be warm with a high of 88, as well as windy and wet, so bring an umbrella.
This afternoon’s 20 percent chance of rain may continue into the evening, but the wind should die down.

The Macy’s Fourth of July fireworks show is back on the East River this year, but it’s a bit farther north.
The five barges that will hold the 60,000 or so explosives will be positioned between 24th and 41st Streets.
So be warned: Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights will not be the prime viewing spots this year.
Instead, try Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, said Susan Tercero, vice president for Macy’s branded entertainment. F.D.R. Drive will be closed to cars at 7 p.m. Access points are at Houston Street and 23rd, 34th and 42nd Streets.
In Brooklyn, head to WNYC Transmitter Park in Greenpoint and Grand Ferry Park and East River State Park in Williamsburg. In Queens, try Hunters Point South Park and Gantry Plaza State Park in Long Island City.
Or, as a ferry captain recently suggested to us, you can hop on an NYC Ferry and try to catch the show from the water.
And tune in to 1010 Wins for a musical score timed to the show.
New York Today is taking the day off on Tuesday, in observance of the Fourth of July. We’ll be back on Wednesday.
