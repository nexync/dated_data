Ten states still have not regained all the jobs they lost in the recession, even after six and a half years of recovery, while many more have seen only modest gains. The figures help illustrate the uneven nature of the rebound since the recession ended in June 2009. Wyoming had 3 percent fewer jobs last month than it did in December 2007, when the recession began, the Labor Department said on Friday. That is the biggest percentage loss among the states. Alabamaâ€™s job total trails its pre-recession level by 2.7 percent, followed by New Mexico, where job totals are 2.6 percent lower. Some larger states are also still behind. New Jersey has nearly 1 percent fewer jobs than it did at the end of 2007, and Missouri is just below its pre-recession level. The other five: Mississippi, Nevada, Maine, Connecticut and West Virginia.
