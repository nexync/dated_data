The brothers Zach and Alex Frankel were reared on the Upper West Side of Manhattan but live in Brooklyn now and missed the local smoked fish emporiums of their childhood. So they are doing something about it: opening on Saturday on the border between Williamsburg and Greenpoint their own version of the appetizing shops they love. Zach Frankel has been in the restaurant business as a manager and chef; his brother’s career has been in music. Together, as they put it, they’re “paying homage to Barney Greengrass, Murray’s and Russ & Daughters,” with the usual white glazed tiles and old family photos. In addition to selling smoked fish, pastrami, bagels and bialys, they have a chef, Ashley Berman, chopping chicken livers, making matzo ball soup and braising brisket based on a recipe from Anita Frankel, the brothers’ grandmother, for fork-tender beef, a tad sweet in the older generation tradition: Frankel’s Delicatessen & Appetizing, 631 Manhattan Avenue (Bedford Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , frankelsdelicatessen.com.
