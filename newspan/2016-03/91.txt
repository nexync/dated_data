Leave it to Prince to announce his new memoir with a last-minute invitation-only performance at a Manhattan nightclub.
After dozens of albums — including four in the last 18 months alone — the prolific, often inscrutable singer and songwriter will turn at least some of his attention to publishing with the release of an autobiography next year, he announced from the second-floor balcony at Avenue in the Meatpacking District on Friday night.
Prince then excused himself to put on “some dancing clothes,” returning more than an hour later for a quick concert.
In an announcement, the Spiegel & Grau imprint of Random House called Prince “one of the most iconic, acclaimed, and inspiring artists of our time.” The book’s acquisition was arranged by Chris Jackson, Spiegel & Grau’s executive editor, known for his work on “Between the World and Me” by Ta-Nehisi Coates, which won the 2015 National Book Award for nonfiction, and Jay Z’s “Decoded,” a memoir-through-lyrics from 2010.
“Millions of words have been written about Prince — books and articles, essays and criticism — but we’re thrilled to be publishing Prince’s powerful reflections on his own life in his own incandescently vivid, witty and poetic voice,” Mr. Jackson said in a statement.
Spiegel & Grau said it expects to release the memoir — described as “an unconventional and poetic journey through his life and creative work” — in the fall of 2017.
At Avenue, before Prince materialized to speak and then again to perform, members of the media and publishing industry mingled and danced under flashing red lights and a disco ball.
On Friday night, Prince’s appearance stuck to that stripped-down set-up — in theory, at least. After revealing his plans for the book and getting into the proper attire, Prince sat at a keyboard above the intimate crowd, playing and shouting along to pre-recorded backing tracks from his D.J.’s laptop as they boomed through the club.
“Ain’t nothing random about this funk!” he added.
