MOSCOW — Nadya V. Savchenko, a captured Ukrainian military pilot who, in a show of defiance, raised her middle finger to a Russian judge and sang the Ukrainian national anthem in court, ended a dry hunger strike on Thursday by drinking water, according to her lawyer.
But she may have done so after falling for a trick by Russian intelligence officers, her lawyer, Mark Feygin, said.
The Ukrainian news media reported that Ms. Savchenko had agreed to drink water after receiving a letter from President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. Mr. Feygin said he received the letter from a person he understood to be a Ukrainian consular official. Mr. Poroshenko’s office, however, issued a statement saying the president had sent no such letter but had asked only that Ms. Savchenko’s sister convey his concern and support.
Ms. Savchenko’s refusal to drink water had gone on for five days, through the closing arguments in her trial and her defiant final statement to the court, and she had vowed to carry on. Ms. Savchenko, a 34-year-old veteran of a Ukrainian deployment to Iraq before her more recent duties in Ukraine, was detained under unclear circumstances and is on trial in Russia for the murder of two journalists.
The Russian authorities accuse her of acting as an artillery spotter and directing mortar fire at a rebel checkpoint where the television reporters were filming. Ms. Savchenko denies this. Her backers say she was captured before the mortar strike and illegally bundled across the border to Russia to stand trial. Since then, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, among others, have called for her release.
Mr. Feygin said that while she has broken the dry hunger strike, she would continue to refuse food, the Ukrainian news media reported.
