At the Oscars, bits by the host, Chris Rock, in which he was inserted into nominated films like “The Martian” were among the highlights of a much-criticized ceremony. The director J.J. Abrams’s company Bad Robot had a hand in those spoofs. And now Mr. Rock and Mr. Abrams will sit down for a conversation at the Tribeca Film Festival next month, one of several talks that organizers announced on Monday.
The actor Tom Hanks (whose “A Hologram for the King” is on the festival schedule) will speak with the television host John Oliver; the filmmaker and actress Jodie Foster will sit down with the director Julie Taymor; and Baz Luhrmann, creator of the coming Netflix series “The Get Down,” will talk with the writer Nelson George. Tina Fey, Patti Smith, Alfonso Cuarón, Francis Ford Coppola, Catherine Hardwicke and Idina Menzel will also take part in Tribeca Talks.
The festival will run April 13-24. For Tribeca Talks ticket information, dates and locations, go to tribecafilm.com.
