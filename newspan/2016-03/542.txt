“The Martian,” Ridley Scott’s big-budget Hollywood adaptation of Andy Weir’s novel, gave a sense of how a state-of-the-art mission to the red planet might look. Now “A Space Program” offers a decidedly low-tech alternative.
As much installation video as documentary, Van Neistat’s film is the record of an extended tongue-in-cheek simulation of a voyage to Mars by the artist Tom Sachs and a crew of assistants that was performed before an amused audience at the Park Avenue Armory in 2012. It comes at the front edge of a boomlet of Sachs openings: a solo show at the Noguchi Museum in Queens next Wednesday, and an exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum in April.
Whatever else the film carries, it packs some serious whimsy. The Mars landing is handled by an astronaut successfully completing an ancient Atari video game; planetary explorations to gather and dispatch samples feature a handsaw and bottle rockets. Displaying primitive ingenuity, the movie recalls Georges Méliès and the early days of cinema. And as a tribute to NASA, “A Space Program” is rich in the core elements that have always propelled humanity’s flights of fancy: imagination and the right tools.
