Designed in 1961 by the architect John Lautner, the house is one of Los Angeles’s most beloved landmarks: it served as a backdrop for films (“The Big Lebowski,” “Charlie’s Angels”), countless fashion shoots (Vanity Fair, Vogue, Dior) and splashy parties (Rihanna’s 27th birthday). Goldstein bought the residence in 1972, working with Lautner and others to renovate it over the years, adding a rooftop tennis court next door and his own nightclub underneath, the appropriately titled Club James.
With concrete angles and hidden, retractable glass walls, the indoor-outdoor Space Age bachelor pad is “a sci-fi nerd’s wet dream,” as the “Veep” actor Reid Scott, who toured the residence for the first time, put it. Or an accident waiting to happen. You can fall in the koi pond beneath the walkway into the living room (and people have), wander off the edge of the master bedroom floor that extends like a ship’s bow into the Los Angeles skyline or stumble on the walkway to the James Turrell skyspace in the lush jungle landscape on the four-acre property.
