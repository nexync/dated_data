Houston — Ted Cruz is probably the most relieved man in the state of Texas tonight, though he’s probably not surprised. Whatever likability issues our junior senator has — and Mr. Cruz has them, even here, in spades — the state’s Republicans stayed true to his conservative crusade, and held Donald J. Trump at bay.
Alas for Cruz supporters, the news wasn’t quite as good as it appeared. A resounding victory would have been one that brought him 50 percent of the Republican vote here, which, in turn, could have given him all of Texas’ 155 delegates, a cohort Mr. Cruz desperately needed even to begin to close in on Mr. Trump.
“I don’t think he will win 50 percent of a single congressional district,” said Bob Stein, a longtime pollster and professor of political science at Rice University. It would be only a minor consolation to the Cruz campaign that Mr. Rubio failed to reach the 20 percent threshold required to win any statewide delegates. So far, Mr. Cruz looked to have amassed about 32 delegates, which means he’s not exactly breathing down Mr. Trump’s neck overall.
