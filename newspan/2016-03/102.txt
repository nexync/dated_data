He was a big, lumbering man with closely cropped white hair, but when demonstrating how to catch a grounder, there was a fluidity and assurance to his movements that I had seen only the few times I had gone to Yankee Stadium. Billy — I hadn’t known that was his name — began to take me over to Trojan Field in Bronx Park and hit me endless ground balls and long flies with his old taped bat, and finally, a couple of years later, succeeded in turning me into a pretty decent ballplayer.
He also told me stories about his days playing with the Harlem Black Bombers in the Negro leagues. He’d laugh and whack me on the back when he told me the difficulties he and his teammates had finding a place to sleep in certain parts of the country. It seemed people would come out to watch them play, but wouldn’t give them a place to sleep.
Years after I had moved from the “old” neighborhood, I was playing third base for James Monroe High School when I thought I saw a man who might have been Billy sitting far up in the nearly deserted left-field stands. But when the game was over, he had gone.
