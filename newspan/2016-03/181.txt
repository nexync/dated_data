A lawyer representing Jenrry Mejia, the Mets pitcher who was permanently barred from Major League Baseball for failing three drug tests, said Friday that baseball used unscrupulous tactics in its handling of his doping offenses.
The lawyer, Vincent White, referred in vague terms to various ways he believed M.L.B.’s inquiry into Mejia was corrupt. Speaking at a news conference at his Queens law firm, he refused to provide details or any form of substantiation for his claims.
M.L.B. rejected White’s accusations in a statement.
White said Mejia would challenge baseball’s sanctions. M.L.B.’s drug-testing program, which is jointly administered with the players’ union, caught Mejia using anabolic steroids three times. He was penalized twice in 2015, then received the permanent suspension last month.
Mejia, 26, said in an interview last week that he was guilty only of the first doping offense. After the second positive test, which Mejia said was inaccurate, he was pressured by M.L.B. officials to share information about his doping connections, he said.
Baseball officials denied making any such threats.
The players’ union and Mejia’s agent, Peter Greenberg, have not publicly commented on Mejia’s case, citing confidentiality provisions in baseball’s drug-testing policy.
Baseball’s antidoping protocols allow for Mejia to apply for reinstatement after a year, in 2017. But the minimum penalty is two years so Mejia would not be eligible to play again until 2018.
