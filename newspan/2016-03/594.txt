“Do you remember a boy named Bengino from a few years ago?” my co-worker says, entering the classroom in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn.
Normally, seasoned teachers stop to think of former students, but I have a knack for quick recollection.
I hadn’t noticed my colleague’s sullen expression until I glanced up.
The news causes me to fall back in the chair.
Benji, a public school student in the inner city, was content in school past 3 o’clock.
I held up a hand, which he slapped with confidence that should have been bottled and branded.
I look at the door Benji would enter. Suddenly, I want to throw my arms around him and squeeze. I want to feel his high-five. But mostly, I want to teach him the dance he loved so much.
