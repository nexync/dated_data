Urban Stages Theater, 259 W 30th St.
In 1900, in a riverside town near Birmingham, England, a 14-year-old white girl who worked in vaudeville had a baby fathered by a fellow vaudevillian, a black American. And so the story behind “Mabel Madness,” Trezana Beverley’s consistently beguiling solo show at Urban Stages, began.
The child, who later became famous as Mabel Mercer, was raised by her grandmother at first, while her teenage mother toured, then by convent nuns. Ms. Beverley, who both wrote and stars in this one-act musical play, makes Mercer’s story compelling, taking her to Paris, where she developed her low-key, storytelling vocal style; she frequently performed while seated in an armchair. Cole Porter, a regular at the club Bricktop’s, adored her.
She left for the United States in 1938. A group of friends, including Marlene Dietrich, paid her way, on the ocean liner Queen Mary, because they feared for her safety as Hitler’s forces advanced. She eventually found love — with Harry Beard, her manager. She quickly found ardent fans, among them Frank Sinatra, who sat raptly in the audience during her New York club appearances and asked her to teach him how she did it.
When Ms. Beverley sings, she makes the case beautifully for Mercer’s greatness of style. The show’s numbers include a thrilling “Summertime,” a chilling “Love for Sale” and a delightful “Just One of Those Things” (in which she alternates between singing as Sinatra and as Mercer, who died in 1984).
The production itself, directed by Frances Hill and Peter Napolitano, could be more polished. But the heart is there, and Nicholas Blade Guldner’s video design, with evocative vintage black-and-white images, adds a great deal to its atmosphere.
