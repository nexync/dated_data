At galleries from Copenhagen to Chicago, the beauty of thinking outside the box.
Since opening her gallery three years ago, the Danish dealer has built her reputation on an unerring sense of what’s next in art, fashion and furniture. She was the first to show the colorful Brutalist sculptures of Pettersen & Hein and the neon-and-resin lights of Sabine Marcelis, and was an early supporter of Thomas Poulsen, better known as FOS, whose work now graces the interiors of Céline stores in London and New York. Although Foerlev studied at the Sotheby’s Institute of Art, her impeccable taste seemed almost predetermined: She grew up in a house built for her grandfather by the legendary architect Arne Jacobsen. (Her great-grandfather’s home, outfitted by the most cutting-edge craftsmen of his day, is now part of the National Museum of Denmark.) ‘‘I feel like I’m channeling their desire to work with forward-thinkers,’’ she says.
In 2010, Ryngaert made his curatorial debut installing the work of a Korean furniture designer in the window of a Brussels fashion boutique. He was just 27, yet had already been collecting for years; his then-roving gallery, Victor Hunt, was an attempt to support the experiments of his young designer friends in ways that the established galleries weren’t. “I started not only paying for production, but also hired a production manager who handles fabrication, so that the designers can concentrate on their creative process,” says Ryngaert. And yet, Victor Hunt, so named to take the focus off its owner, is no idealistic underdog. It gained a permanent downtown address in 2011, and has garnered buzz at Design Miami and Collective Design with innovative glass lighting by Sylvain Willenz and kaleidoscopic clocks by Humans Since 1982. By early next year, Ryngaert plans to unveil a project that’s ambitious by any standards: an entire house and its contents, from soup to nuts, designed by Tomás Alonso.
