Financed by loans from Indian Railways and other sources, President Rajapaksaâ€™s government rebuilt the line over five years. On a sunny afternoon in October 2014, the president made the inaugural journey to Jaffna aboard the Queen of Jaffna train, known in Tamil as the Yarl Devi. Garlanded with flowers and banana leaves, it rolled into Jaffna to an explosion of cheers and firecrackers.
I made all my travel arrangements in Sri Lanka through the Experience Travel Group, a London-based company that specializes in tours through South Asia. The founder and owner, Sam Clark, set me up with a car and driver in Colombo, and arranged for my guide in Jaffna (44-20-79-24-7133 |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| experiencetravelgroup.com).
Choices of hotels in Jaffna, which is relatively new to tourism, are few, but I stayed at the decent Jaffna Heritage Hotel near the center of town, which has 11 clean rooms, a small pool and a good restaurant. A single room goes for about $89 a night. (Temple Road, Nallur, Jafna; 94-21-222-2424; jaffnaheritage.com/jaffnahotel).
