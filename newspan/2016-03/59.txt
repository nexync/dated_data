One of the N.F.L.’s flashiest stars just a few years ago, Robert Griffin III signed a two-year contract Thursday with the Cleveland Browns, a franchise on a perpetual mission to find a quarterback. Financial terms were not immediately available.
Griffin has not been the same since his dazzling rookie season with Washington in 2012. The Browns, who tried to trade up and draft Griffin four years ago, believe he can still lead on and off the field, and they are giving him a chance to revive his career and win their starting job.
Cleveland has started 24 quarterbacks since 1999, and the team is expected to take one with the No. 2 overall pick in this year’s draft.
JETS RE-SIGN LINEBACKER The Jets re-signed linebacker Erin Henderson to a two-year contract. Henderson, 29, played in every Jets game last season after sitting out all of 2014. He had 45 total tackles and was a key contributor on special teams.
