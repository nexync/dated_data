Good morning on this warmer Wednesday.
After almost two years of fits and starts, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s affordable-housing plan passed the City Council on Tuesday.
The plan requires developers who build in rezoned areas to create low-cost rental units representing around 20 percent to 30 percent of all units.
For renters, who have seen the number of rent-controlled apartments decline over the years, this could be a chance to get an apartment below market value.
But not everyone is a fan of the plan.
The vote at the City Council chambers got rowdy, as our reporter, J. David Goodman, wrote.
As some protesters were guided out, others joined hands — possibly stuck together with Super Glue, Council officials said — and had to be removed by the police.
We get it: Changes to the zoning code affect the essence of the city.
The zoning code of 1916 (the country’s first zoning ordinance) required tall buildings to have setbacks, which give some older structures their tiered exteriors.
In 1961, the zoning code was altered and encouraged more broad plazas and arcades. A good example is the area around the Seagram Building, on Park Avenue.

Ah, that feels nice.
• Scoreboard: Hornets sting Nets, 105-100.
• Alternate-side parking: in effect until tomorrow.
It might be hump day, but two colorful celebrations are kicking off this evening: the Jewish feast of Purim and the Hindu festival of Holi.
In New York, there are plenty of ways to celebrate both.
• Or use The Times’s recipe to cook up a batch of hamantaschen (with poppy seed filling).
Chag sameach and Holi mubarak!
