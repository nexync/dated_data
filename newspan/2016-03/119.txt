Although they’re not related, the musical-comedy team Savannah & Chase, a.k.a. Savannah Brown and Chase O’Donnell, might be described as the Smothers Sisters. “Too Blondes,” their goofy, effervescent show at the Metropolitan Room on Wednesday evening, began with the kind of comedic confusion that used to be a running joke in Tom and Dick Smothers’ television variety show.
This one-hour variety show is a tenuously connected collection of semi-improvised sketches in which the women play ambitious show business aspirants who banter, sing, dance and fantasize. Ms. Brown’s alter ego suggests a madcap hybrid of Marilyn Monroe and Gracie Allen. Ms. O’Donnell’s character frets that her career is over because she hasn’t become a star at 22. For her torch song parody, “Going Dark,” which she claims to have written at 15, she dropped the name Anne Frank and wailed about having her soul “ripped out” by a heartbreak that she later admitted she has yet to experience.
In one of the longer bits, the pair pretended to audition for the role of the white Diana Ross in a show about the Supremes, but the humor was a little too flighty to land. They’re good dancers, and their vigorous “Dance Versatility” number is an absurdist potpourri of styles, from ballet to hip-hop to Bob Fosse.
The backup musicians, Sheridan Stevens on piano and Oliver Switzer on guitar, contributed to the good humor. The most offbeat number, “Leader of ISIS,” written and performed by Mr. Stevens (Michael Liebhauser co-wrote the lyrics) while the women took a break, was a bizarre hybrid of traditional cabaret love song and terrorist threat that suggested a deadpan comic broadside by Tom Lehrer. It left me wanting an entire show of Mr. Stevens’s work.
