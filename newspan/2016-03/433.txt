On social media and in public rallies, civil rights groups, businesses and politicians expressed dismay at the law, which was passed by the Republican-controlled legislature and signed by the governor within just 12 hours during a hasty special session on Wednesday.
American Airlines, which employs 14,000 people in the state and has its second largest hub in Charlotte, along with other companies with operations in the state, including Apple, Dow Chemical, PayPal, Red Hat and Biogen, all issued statements critical of the new law.
The immediate trigger for the legislature’s action was the passage of an anti-discrimination ordinance in Charlotte last month that would permit transgender people to use public bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity, rather than their gender at birth. But the law passed by the legislature on Wednesday night, which prohibits municipalities from passing their own ordinances allowing such bathroom use, also prevents cities from protecting gays and bisexual people against discrimination generally.
Conservative groups, using the hashtag #keepncsafe, were quick to praise the legislature and thanked the governor for signing a bill they said would protect women and children from unwanted advances from biological males in bathrooms.
Critics of the law, which also prohibits local governments from setting minimum wages above the state level and strips veterans of anti-discrimination protections, vowed to fight back in the court of public opinion as well as investigate legal remedies. On Twitter, Mr. McCrory’s Democratic opponent in the governor’s race, Attorney General Roy Cooper, posted a video and joined numerous critics who voiced their anger under the hashtag #WeAreNotThis.
And on Twitter, a new account calling for a boycott of the state emerged in response to the law. Chris Sacca, a Silicon Valley investor, implied he would no longer invest in businesses in the state.
