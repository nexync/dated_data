Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he would not seek a recount of the results in Missouri’s Democratic presidential primary, conceding defeat to Hillary Clinton.
Mrs. Clinton has a narrow lead of 1,531 votes. Under state law Sanders could have sought a recount because the margin was less than one-half of 1 percent.
Mrs. Clinton will get an extra two delegates from Missouri for winning the statewide vote. She won all five of Tuesday’s primary contests, including Florida, Ohio, Illinois and North Carolina.
The Republican race in Missouri remains too close to call between Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.
Some votes have yet to be counted, including an unknown number of overseas absentee and military ballots as well as provisional ballots, which are offered to voters who are not listed on precinct registers or when their registration records cannot be found.
