Andreas Staier’s harpsichord recital at the Frick Collection on Sunday evening was easy to respect but sometimes hard to love. Mr. Staier is an excellent and thoughtful performer on early keyboard instruments — the fortepiano as well as the harpsichord — but somewhat dour in mien, and his program here was almost unrelievedly gloomy.
Melancholy here, Mr. Staier said from the stage, referred not so much to a passing mood as to a philosophical concept, one of the four temperaments of antiquity, mingled with notions of worldly vanity, decay and death. Just shoot me now.
In works by Jean-Henri d’Anglebert, Johann Caspar Ferdinand Fischer, Louis Couperin and Louis-Nicolas Clérambault, movement after movement was indicated to be played tenderly, slowly, very slowly, gravely. There were also two tombeaus (memorials).
Mr. Staier mustered a bit of a sparkle when he discussed Couperin’s “Tombeau de M. de Blancrocher.” Blancrocher, a lutenist a.k.a. Charles Fleury, died from injuries suffered in an evidently alcohol-related fall down a staircase. Mr. Staier took some delight in pointing out a tumbling theme that Couperin wrote into the music.
Surely, you kept thinking, there would have to be an encore after this program to lighten things up a bit. There was none, but in fairness, the last work, the big Passacaglia from Georg Muffat’s “Apparatus Musico-Organisticus,” mostly did the trick.
In this ebullient, overstuffed outpouring of notes, which all but exploded the traditional form, Mr. Staier finally unleashed the full range of his virtuosity, veering perhaps toward some mix of the sanguine and choleric temperaments of old: an utter joy.
