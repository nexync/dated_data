Carmen M. Ortiz, the United States attorney for Massachusetts, announced an investigation on Wednesday into alleged civil rights violations at the prestigious Boston Latin School. Earlier this year, two black students used social media to draw attention to what they described as simmering racial hostilities there, and an investigation by the district found administrators had violated internal policy in one of seven episodes related to race. Last week, a group of civil rights organizations urged Ms. Ortiz to investigate claims of racism and harassment at the school. Ms. Ortiz said that Mayor Martin J. Walsh and Tommy Chang, the superintendent of the cityâ€™s schools, were cooperating with the effort.
