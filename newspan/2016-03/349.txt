Releasing a new album by surprise can be a smart marketing strategy — if you are already a big star.
This week, Kendrick Lamar’s new album, “untitled unmastered.” — which, according to Mr. Lamar, consists of demos from his album “To Pimp a Butterfly” — shot to No. 1 on Billboard’s chart, with 142,000 sales and 43.5 million streams in the United States, according to Nielsen.
Like a growing number of prominent albums, “untitled unmastered.” (TDE/Aftermath/Interscope) arrived with no advance notice, yet generated a wave of attention on social media and from the entertainment press. For decades, the music industry’s marketing M.O. has been to stoke an artist’s fans for weeks or months by releasing singles and advertising an album’s title and look. For artists like Lady Gaga or Taylor Swift, the campaigns have been on the scale of a major movie release, emphasizing an album’s release date to generate blockbuster sales numbers in their first week.
At the same time, plenty of big-name acts have been exploring the value of surprise. Radiohead scored the first major coup in 2007 with “In Rainbows,” which the band released itself through a pay-what-you-wish model, another innovation. But the current wave largely follows the success of Beyoncé’s self-titled album in December 2013, which was at first released only through iTunes, the only publicity came from Beyoncé’s own social media accounts, at least until the release itself was celebrated by the media as a major news event.
Also this week, Adele’s “25” (XL/Columbia) holds at No. 2; “ColleGrove” (Def Jam), an album by the rapper 2 Chainz with appearances by Lil Wayne, opens at No. 4; and Justin Bieber’s “Purpose” (RBMG/Def Jam) is No. 5.
