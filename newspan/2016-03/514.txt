Apple’s ambitions to go head to head with Netflix and create its own lineup of exclusive movies and TV shows has long been the subject of much chatter and speculation.
But its first original TV project — a nonscripted series about apps — might sound more like a marketing campaign than a blockbuster production.
The series represents Apple’s first original effort outside the music category, where it has released programming such as Taylor Swift’s 1989 world tour, a docu-series with Vice about the local music scene and exclusive video interviews with artists like Adele.
Mr. Cue said that the new series did not signal a broader ambition by the company to greatly bolster its presence in original productions and streaming video. Last year, Apple was rumored to be exploring options for original programing and held talks with a number of big TV companies about offering a streaming television service.
The new app show came about after Mr. Silverman brought the idea to Apple. Mr. Silverman, who is an executive producer of the TV series “Jane the Virgin,” “Marco Polo” and “Flaked,” worked with Mr. Cue nearly a decade ago when he was an executive producer of “The Office,” which was made available on iTunes.
“We thought it was perfectly tailored for Apple,” Mr. Cue said.
