LONDON â€” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Tuesday that it had hired Fredrik Reinfeldt, the former prime minister of Sweden, as a senior adviser for its business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Mr. Reinfeldt served as prime minister of Sweden from 2006 and 2014 and was president of the European Council in 2009.
Mr. Reinfeldt is the latest in a series of former elected officials to join an investment bank following their time in office.
Harold Ford Jr., the former congressman from Tennessee, joined Merrill Lynch as a vice chairman in 2007, considered a run for United States Senate in New York in 2010 and later moved to Morgan Stanley as a managing director and senior client relationship manager in 2011.
Eric Cantor, the former House majority leader, joined the boutique investment bank Moelis & Company as vice chairman and a director after he lost his seat in Congress in 2014.
Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, served as a paid adviser to both Lehman Brothers and Barclays after leaving office and severed his ties with the British bank last year ahead of his unsuccessful run for the Republican presidential nomination.
