Adrienne Corri, an actress whose movie career lasted nearly five decades and encompassed a wide range of roles, but who was probably best known as the victim in an infamous rape scene in Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange,” died on March 13 at her home in London. She was 84.
The cause was a massive coronary, her son, Patrick Filmer-Sankey, wrote in an email.
Her fearlessness stood her in good stead two decades later when Kubrick cast her in a harrowing scene in “A Clockwork Orange” (released in the United States in 1971), his adaptation of Anthony Burgess’s dystopian novel of the same name.
In the scene, the movie’s antihero, a thug played by Malcolm McDowell, barges into her home with three of his cronies before they assault her husband and trash their house as Mr. McDowell belts “Singin’ in the Rain.” Mr. McDowell cuts off Ms. Corri’s clothes, then tells her helpless husband to watch before he rapes her. Kubrick insisted that Ms. Corri appear naked for multiple takes.
That scene and other violent and sexually explicit material initially earned the film an X rating in the United States. It remained controversial for years after its limited British release, drawing protests and news reports of alleged copycat crimes.
Nevertheless, “A Clockwork Orange” was nominated for four Oscars, including best picture, director and screenplay, in 1972.
Adrienne Riccoboni was born in Glasgow on Nov. 13, 1931, and raised in Edinburgh. Her son said she left home as a teenager and performed with traveling theater groups before attending the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London.
She had two children, Patrick and a daughter, Sarah Filmer-Sankey, with the film producer Patrick Filmer-Sankey in the 1950s. They both survive her, as do a sister, Brenda Simonetti, and a granddaughter.
Ms. Corri’s marriage to the actor Daniel Massey ended in divorce.
