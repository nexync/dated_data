The Shukhov Tower, a 1920s broadcast transmission tower in Moscow that is a landmark of modernist structural engineering, has been placed on the 2016 World Monuments Fund Watch list of endangered global cultural heritage sites.
Activists in Moscow organized two days of events over the weekend to observe the tower’s 94th birthday, including tours, lectures and films about the structure’s international significance and about Vladimir Shukhov, its pioneering creator. They said that the situation is so dire, with the tower awkwardly propped up and completely neglected by officials, that only direct interference by President Vladimir V. Putin can save it.
The Shukhov Tower was completed in 1922, just after the Russian Civil War. It is composed of hyperboloids arranged in order of diminishing size. During a campaign to save the tower in 2014, signatories of a petition to Mr. Putin included Elizabeth Diller, a creator of New York’s High Line, and the Dutch architect and theorist Rem Koolhaas.
The Russian branch of Docomomo, an international organization that works to document and conserve buildings, has started a new petition to Mr. Putin.
Joshua David, the president of the World Monuments Fund, also speaking via Skype said at the news conference that the grass-roots experience of creating the High Line in New York is a good model for saving the tower in Moscow.
At a Kremlin meeting last December, Mr. Putin praised activists for rallying to save cultural heritage sites and dressed down officials for not doing enough.
