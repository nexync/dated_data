Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how daily news, features and opinion pieces come together at The New York Times. In this piece, Jodi Rudoren answers questions from readers about her four years as The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief.
Jodi Rudoren spent nearly four years as The Times’s Jerusalem bureau chief. She covered two Gaza wars and two Israeli elections, failed peace talks and terror attacks. And, according to her editors, she inspired more reader mail than any correspondent in history.
Ms. Rudoren is back in New York, as deputy international editor, and we invited readers to submit questions to her — about The Times’s coverage of Israel and the Palestinians, life in Jerusalem, anything at all. And they did. More than 200 readers emailed the day we invited submissions.
Many of the questions readers asked were about bias in The Times’s coverage. In this podcast, Ms. Rudoren addresses accusations of Pro-Israel and Pro-Palestinian bias as well as questions about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (“not a popular man in Israel”), Israeli politics (“extremely volatile”), Israeli sentiment on President Obama (“across the political spectrum there is deep suspicion and negative feeling about Obama”), and life in Jerusalem (“much, much safer than being in New York”).
