Donald J. Trump says regularly that he “cherishes” women and that he would be their greatest advocate as president, but his latest feud with Ted Cruz — in which he threatened the Texas senator’s wife, Heidi, and reposted an unflattering picture of her on Twitter — has resurfaced questions about his history of making comments that some find to be sexist. Over the years, Mr. Trump has said several things that his critics have called offensive. This is a sampling of such comments.
“You know, it doesn’t really matter what [the media] write as long as you’ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass,” Mr. Trump said in a 1991 interview with Esquire magazine.
“A person who is flat-chested is very hard to be a 10,” Mr. Trump said to Mr. Stern, also in 2005.
“What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?” Mr. Trump said on Twitter in 2013.
“You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. There was blood coming out of her wherever,” Mr. Trump said after a Fox News debate in 2015, in an interview with CNN.
“Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president? I mean, she’s a woman, and I’m not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?” Mr. Trump, referring to Carly Fiorina, in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine in 2015.
