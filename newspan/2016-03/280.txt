The U.S.S. Conestoga, which disappeared in 1921, was discovered off the coast of San Francisco.
A Navy tugboat that disappeared after it sailed from San Francisco in 1921 has been found by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers in shark-infested waters about 30 miles west of San Francisco, putting an end to a 95-year-old mystery.
The tugboat, the U.S.S. Conestoga, left California with 56 officers and crew members on board, bound for Tutuila, American Samoa, by way of Hawaii. When the ship failed to arrive, the Navy carried out an expansive air and sea search, but only a battered lifeboat with the letter “C” on its bow was ever found, hundreds of miles off the expected course.
The whereabouts of the ship had since been one of the Navy’s greatest puzzles, but on Wednesday the N.O.A.A. and the Navy announced the mystery solved.
In 2009, the N.O.A.A. Office of Coast Survey spotted an uncharted shipwreck near the Farallon Islands, a forbidding cluster of sharp rocks known for shipwrecks and a large population of great white sharks. Video from an investigation in 2015 using remotely operated vehicles shows the shipwreck under nearly 200 feet of water, encrusted in rust but largely intact, festooned with colorful sea anemones, rockfish and eels.
Using the video, the N.O.A.A. and Navy researchers confirmed that the wreck’s distinctive propeller and deck-mounted gun matched the long-lost tugboat.
“After nearly a century of ambiguity and a profound sense of loss, the Conestoga’s disappearance no longer is a mystery,” Manson Brown, a deputy N.O.A.A. administrator, said in a statement.
Researchers said they believed that the boat had sunk as the crew members tried to reach a protected cove on the Farallons.
The exact location of the wreckage was not announced, to prevent unauthorized diving or looting, the agency said.
