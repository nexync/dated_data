In an article about the Brooklyn Navy Yard last fall, Chris Terrell, a wine importer, described what it was like to run a business inside the 300-acre walled industrial park. “It’s literally like working in a federal prison,” he said, referring to the security checkpoints. If that’s your fetish, get there quickly, because the rusted old shipyard, which New York City bought from the federal government in 1966, is rapidly going the way of the rest of Brooklyn, with a small-batch distillery and rooftop farm already in place and a cavernous food hall featuring an outpost of Russ & Daughters, a purveyor of smoked fish and Jewish delicacies, on the way. The yard, which has long been closed to everyone but employees and their guests, is in the process of opening up, with more than 300 industrial tenants currently humming and promises of wider public access in the near future. If you hand-slice Nova, they will come.
