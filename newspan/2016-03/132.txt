Six daily newspapers in the San Francisco Bay Area will be merged into two, one serving Oakland and the East Bay and the other Silicon Valley. The Bay Area News Group said the move would result in a modest reduction in staffing, but did not provide details. The company said that in the East Bay, The Contra Costa Times, Oakland Tribune, The Daily Review and The Argus would combine to become the new East Bay Times. The media groupâ€™s vice president for audience, Dan Smith, said that in Silicon Valley, The San Jose Mercury News and The San Mateo County Times would form The Mercury News. Mr. Smith said subscribers in Oakland, Hayward and Fremont also would receive new community weeklies. He said the changes, starting April 5, were prompted by a survey of subscribers.
