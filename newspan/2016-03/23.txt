The members of the State Board of Regents on Monday elected Betty A. Rosa, a former New York City principal and superintendent, as the new chancellor, signaling a sharp shift in the state’s education policies after dramatic protests by parents.
Board members are elected by the Legislature, and set education policy for the state.
Dr. Rosa’s election is an indication of how much both politicians and the public have turned against the policies promoted by Dr. Tisch, including the evaluation of teachers on the basis of state test scores. In December, the Regents placed a four-year moratorium on including the scores as a factor in teacher evaluations. Dr. Rosa has said she would like to make that change permanent.
Dr. Rosa, who represents the Bronx, was elected by a vote of 15 to 0, with two abstentions.
Dr. Rosa, 64, was born in New York City but spent much of her early childhood in Puerto Rico. She worked as a bilingual teacher in the city’s schools before becoming principal of Intermediate School 218, a middle school in Upper Manhattan. Later she was the superintendent of District 8 in the Bronx, which includes some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods.
High Achievement New York, a group of business leaders, educators, parents and civil rights leaders that supports the Common Core standards in New York, issued a statement congratulating Dr. Rosa but expressing concern that she had been endorsed by parents opposed to the state tests.
Dr. Rosa said in an interview earlier this month that she believed in high standards, but that she thought there should be more recognition of the challenges that schools serving poor students face in meeting them.
