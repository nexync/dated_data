After Taking a Shower, Shower Your Lawn?
Food from garden to table. Solar power from roof to outlet. And now soapy water from your own shower to your lawn?
One of the many new technologies discussed Tuesday at a White House Water Summit aims to reclaim water from showers and sinks, clean it and use it for irrigation and flushing toilets, among other non-potable uses in the same home. It’s not unlike the water recycling system used for golf courses, but it’s available to individuals.
The system, created by a company called Nexus e-Water out of Australia and now headquartered in San Diego, will be deployed for the first time in a major home development in Lathrop, Calif., a suburb 75 miles east of San Francisco. Soon after, the company plans to begin selling to individual homeowners.
The system is costly. In new homes, the infrastructure — a set of pipes running from the shower and laundry and sinks to the water cleaning system — could cost $7,000 to $10,000, said Ralph Petroff, the company’s co-founder. It would be more than that to rip out the infrastructure of an existing home and put in a second set of pipes to tote the so-called gray water.
This technology falls into a growing movement to enable homeowners to generate natural resources on site.
