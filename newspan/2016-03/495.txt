A snowmobile driver accused of colliding with two teams of mushers in the Iditarod dog-sled race in Alaska over the weekend has apologized, saying that he had been drinking before the episode.
Alaska State Troopers arrested Arnold Demoski, 26, and charged him with assault, endangerment, reckless driving and criminal mischief for driving early Saturday morning into the teams of two racers, Aliy Zirkle and Jeff King. One of Mr. King’s dogs was killed in the crash, and two others were wounded but were expected to survive.
Mr. Demoski, who became emotional as he apologized in an interview, described the crash as an accident.
Ms. Zirkle’s sled was struck by the snowmobile around 2:45 a.m. as she headed to one of the race’s checkpoints in a remote part of Alaska. The collision bruised one of her dogs, the police said. They said that Mr. King’s team, which was behind Ms. Zirkle’s, was struck about 12 miles outside of Nulato, a community of a couple hundred residents on the Yukon River. It has no road access but serves as one of the race’s checkpoints.
Mr. King, a four-time champion of the race, said the crash felt like “an intentional act of reckless bravado.” Race organizers said the teams had been hit on purpose.
“Based upon the firsthand accounts provided by both Aliy and Jeff, we have no reason to believe these were not intentional acts,” Stan Hooley, chief executive of the Iditarod Trail Committee, said in a statement on Sunday.
