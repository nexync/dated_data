As it does every year, New Directors/New Films is offering a globe-trotting sampler of more than two dozen features as well as miscellaneous short takes aimed at highlighting the work of emerging artists. This year’s package, which begins on Wednesday and includes 27 features — selected by programmers from the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art — leans toward the somber and includes assorted spirits, a number of slaughtered animals and a variety of environmental disasters, along with an occasional welcome flicker of joy. The following are our favorites from Week 1, in the order in which they are first screened.
UNDER THE SHADOW The opening-night selection gets New Directors off to a strong, eerie, accessible start. Set in Tehran in 1988, toward the end of the Iran-Iraq war, this delectable, increasingly unnerving shiver-fest opens with Shideh (Narges Rashidi), modestly swathed in revolutionary-mandated headdress, vainly pleading with a university official to be allowed to return to medical school. As she sits across from this imperious man, Shideh looks out the window framing her and her interlocutor and sees a bomb falling on the city. The man’s apparent indifference speaks volumes about the enveloping violence as well as the writer-director Babak Anvari’s filmmaking skills.
