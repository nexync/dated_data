JERUSALEM — The young man was on his way out of Gaza on an innocent-seeming mission: to scout potential contestants for his embryonic “Palestinians Got Talent” television show and meet the show’s West Bank staff in Ramallah. He had an Israeli permit for the journey.
Mr. Oweida was traveling with a group of other young Gazans working for the talent show when he arrived at the Erez checkpoint on Feb. 23. Two Israeli soldiers arrived and took him into custody.
