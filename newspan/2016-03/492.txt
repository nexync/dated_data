Though New Yorkers have long insisted that the only real bagels can be found in the five boroughs (with a begrudging acknowledgment of Montreal’s skinnier, sweeter version), young bakers in the farthest corners of the world are making serious dough.
Rebecca Schrage, the Chicago-born daughter of a New York Jew and a Hong Kong native, was working as an investment banker when she started making hand-rolled bagels for fellow expats in her downtime.
