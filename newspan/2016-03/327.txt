LONDON — Sophia Webster, the London-based accessories designer best known for her eye for color and playfully eccentric statement footwear, won the 2016 British Fashion Council/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund prize Tuesday night.
Ms. Webster, who had been in the running for the prize last year and had won the competition’s Emerging Accessories Designer Award in 2013, beat a shortlist that included Prism, Mother of Pearl, Osman and Emilia Wickstead.
The fund provides one designer with a £200,000 grant (about $288,000) and access to 12 months of director-level mentoring from some of the biggest editors, buyers and brands in fashion. Established in 2008, it shares hallmarks with the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund prize, which Anna Wintour helped establish in 2003.
She is a graduate of the Royal College of Art and shoemaking institution Cordwainers and the second woman to win the prize. The announcement was made at the Bulgari Hotel in London.
Previous winners of the prize include Mary Katrantzou, Christopher Kane, Peter Pilotto and Ms. Webster’s onetime mentor, Nicholas Kirkwood, all of whom have gone on to grow their businesses internationally and attract new investment after taking home the award.
Other members of the committee this year included Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue; the designer Victoria Beckham; Joan Burstein, founder of the London concept boutique Browns; and Samantha Cameron, the British Fashion Council ambassador and the wife of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Earlier this month, Ms. Webster unveiled her first full handbag line and her plans to open a boutique on Mayfair’s Mount Street. She has consistently turned heads with her kitschy yet chic aesthetic.
