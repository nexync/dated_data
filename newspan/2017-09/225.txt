Sentilles’s profiles of two men who created art as a response to war — one who had been a conscientious objector during World War II, another who worked as a prison guard at Abu Ghraib — play a prominent role in the book, which also ranges widely through issues of photographic representation, empathy, activism and pacifism. It’s a book in which Jesus and Colin Powell mingle with Roland Barthes, Susan Sontag and Lucretius.
Most of us know that lions form a pride, but many of the other collective nouns for animals described and pleasingly illustrated in Matt Sewell’s “A Charm of Goldfinches: And Other Wild Gatherings” are likely surprises.
