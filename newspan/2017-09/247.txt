Knowing your way around Central Park — finding Sheep Meadow preserve, above, without asking anyone; having a mental map of the public bathrooms; knowing where to get the best hot dogs — is the mark of a true New Yorker. Mr. Arnold honed his navigational skills after he gave up his 9-to-5 job, became a full-time photographer and began wandering around the city. “It’s really been a nice symbol of my new life,” he said. Here, two young lovers.
A man painting in Prospect Park was pointing at the trees, but to Mr. Arnold it looked as if the man was painting the landscape itself. “It felt like kind of this weird surrealist moment,” he said.
Reverend Billy is the self-proclaimed “Spiritual Leader of the Church of Stop Shopping,” a group of performers who describe themselves as “wild anti-consumerist gospel shouters and Earth-loving urban activists,” whose project includes caring for New York’s natural ecosystem. Mr. Arnold stumbled upon them as they were holding a vigil for a willow tree at a community garden in Alphabet City that was close to death. “He had assembled this whole super-colorful, painted-face hippie crowd of all ages to sing songs and say nature prayers for this giant tree,” Mr. Arnold said.
This photograph, which Mr. Arnold described as a “colorful, beautiful expression of summer energy,” was taken at Willowbrook Park.
