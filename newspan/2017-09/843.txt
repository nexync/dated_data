It’s not easy to write a relevant book about internet culture. By the time it hits the press, the online story has already changed. The narrative has outpaced the publishing schedule for “Streampunks: YouTube and the Rebels Remaking Media,” a book about YouTube video makers written by the company’s chief business officer, Robert Kyncl (with assistance from the Google speechwriter Maany Peyvan). Kyncl’s account is suffused with Obama-age technocratic optimism, but we’re in the Trump era now. Many of the “rebels” disrupting the mainstream media these days aren’t exactly humming Kumbaya.
But YouTube can just as easily connect lonely racists as it does isolated queer kids, or accelerate regressive values as quickly as progressive ones. It’s now more obvious than ever that YouTube, like other social networks, has been leveraged by a network of overwhelmingly white, male far-right nativists and chauvinists who use its innovative communication tools to spread messages of terror and domination. In a choice typical of the book’s scope, Kyncl writes glowingly about Vice Media’s chief executive and co-founder Shane Smith, and his mission to remake television news for internet natives ; many of Vice’s raw, on-the-ground videos were hosted on YouTube before they graduated to HBO. Kyncl mentions that Smith started Vice with a Canadian friend named Gavin McInnes, but doesn’t note where McInnes ended up: He’s been making online news videos, too, for far-right sites, and he’s used his media perch to spearhead a crew of “pro-Western” men he calls the Proud Boys.
Recent events rocking the platform — like when PewDiePie, YouTube’s most popular vlogger, was widely criticized for his frequent Nazi jokes, lost his development deal with YouTube, earned the support of the alt-right and ignited a creator-led campaign against YouTube management — are relegated to asides. There is a brief and illuminating discussion of why black YouTubers haven’t risen on the platform that notes how unseen algorithms can reinforce structural inequalities, and a short nod to the dangers of political polarization and the spread of fake news. More space is given to a celebration of how YouTube has helped turn corporate advertising into must-see-TV.
You can see why a person in Kyncl’s position would be eager to cling to a positive story line. He is a YouTube executive who is personally and financially invested in the company’s success. The best you can hope for in an inside account like this is that the insider will serve up some juicy details about how the sausage gets made. Instead, the book hops from new-media conference to new-media conference, often ones featuring Kyncl himself as a speaker. There’s not too much to say about famous YouTubers that they haven’t already vlogged themselves. Meanwhile, the workings of the multinational conglomerate behind the platform remain opaque.
