Watt and his mother, Connie, misstated the distance between Pewaukee and Janesville, Wis., two locations where relief supplies were stored. They are about 50 miles apart, not 30 miles.
An obituary on Monday about the guitarist and songwriter Walter Becker, who founded the band Steely Dan with Donald Fagen, referred incorrectly to the band China Crisis, whose album “Flaunt the Imperfection” Mr. Becker produced. It is English, not Scottish.
