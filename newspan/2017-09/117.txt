Any intrigue in the Packers-Bears game on Thursday night around Chicago’s quarterback situation or national anthem protests was surpassed by a brutal hit by Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan on Packers wide receiver Davante Adams.
In the third quarter of the 35-14 Packers victory, Adams caught a screen pass. He was stopped by a couple of defenders, and was making no forward progress. That’s when Trevathan arrived and slammed helmet-to-helmet into him. Adams’s mouthguard went flying, and he went down hard.
Teammates instantly signaled for medical help, and Adams was removed on a stretcher and taken from the stadium in an ambulance.
Adams had a concussion, NFL Network reported Friday morning. The Packers on Thursday said he had feeling in all extremities.
Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers approached Trevathan after the hit. He later absolved him of intentionally trying to hurt Adams.
Trevathan could potentially face suspension or other disciplinary action from the league for the hit.
