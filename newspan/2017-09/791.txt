BELLEFONTE, Pa. — A son of the former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky pleaded guilty Friday to charges that he pressured a teenage girl to send him naked photos and asked her teenage sister to give him oral sex.
The plea deal for Jeffrey Sandusky, Jerry Sandusky’s son, comes one week before his trial was to begin, and nearly six years after his father was arrested in a child molestation case that shook Penn State and is still working its way through criminal and civil courts.
A call seeking comment from his lawyer was not immediately returned Friday.
As part of the deal, Mr. Sandusky, 41, will spend up to six years in state prison, but the judge could impose a sentence of as much as eight years.
District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller of Centre County said the plea deal ensures the victims will not suffer more trauma by testifying at the trial.
“We are happy that these girls can move forward and experience a life with adults that deserve their trust,” she said.
Mr. Sandusky, one of Jerry Sandusky’s six adopted children, has been a stalwart supporter of his father, who is serving a lengthy prison sentence for sexual abuse of 10 boys.
Jeffrey Sandusky, a state prison guard, knew the girls through their mother, the authorities said.
A state trooper said in the arrest affidavit that last November, the father of the girls gave investigators text messages from Mr. Sandusky in which he asked one of them for nude photographs.
The girl’s mother told investigators that when she confronted Mr. Sandusky, he told her “he knows it was wrong and inappropriate,” the police said.
The girl told the police that the texts made her uncomfortable and that “he kept pressuring me and asked me multiple times not to show the texts to anyone,” the police said.
Prosecutors allege that Mr. Sandusky sought oral sex from the other girl in 2013. She was 15 years old at the time.
