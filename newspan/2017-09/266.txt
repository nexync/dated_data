Ms. Jenkins would not immediately comment on the news, which was confirmed by someone familiar with the deal but not authorized to speak publicly about it. She had already been working with Geoff Johns on a script for the new film, and in June, the studio behind it, Warner Bros., set a release date of Dec. 13, 2019. Gal Gadot will also be returning to star in the title role.
