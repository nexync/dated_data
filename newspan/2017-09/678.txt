Q. When I upload a file to the Google Drive cloud, where is it actually stored, and is it protected from hackers?
Cloud services are often targets for thieves, but personal security by the account holder is often the weak link. Google recommends using two-step verification on Google Drive accounts to add an extra layer of protection, and it says to always fully log out of your account when using shared or public computers. The Safety Center area of the company’s website has other tips and tools for many of its products, including Gmail, Android and Chrome.
In addition to providing a place to store files, Google Drive includes Google Docs, an online software suite for creating and collaborating on documents, spreadsheets and presentations. This summer, the company announced a desktop app for Windows and Mac, called Backup and Sync, that keeps Google Photos and Google Drive files backed up online.
Google’s terms are not unlike those of other companies offering similar services and can be seen as the price of “free.” If they bother you, you can look for a different service with more agreeable terms or encrypt the stored data yourself.
