A khaki jacket in a light cotton or linen has long been a staple in the closets of men and women — traditionally worn on exotic journeys to tropical locales. Yves Saint Laurent’s famous ’60s safari shirts (which he also wore himself) are an enduring example of the appeal and versatility of the style. They were inspired by his muse, the French model Danielle Luquet de Saint Germain, who was fond of wearing men’s clothing and whom Saint Laurent also credited as the genesis of his Le Smoking design. At Gabriela Hearst’s spring/summer 2018 show in New York, she sent out a limited-edition putty-colored wrap blazer and matching skirt, in sustainable linen, that interpreted the classic travel suit in a wonderfully sexy, modern way. While you wait for her designs to hit stores, here are a few versions of the timeless design you can buy now — perfect for any imminent adventures.
