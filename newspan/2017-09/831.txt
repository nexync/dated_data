The 62nd International Debutante Ball (yes, it still takes place) was held Dec. 29 at the Pierre Hotel in New York. This year’s ball featured 46 young women “of distinction” from the United States and abroad who were “introduced” to society. The evening, which began with a receiving line, culminated with each debutante presented in the Grand Ballroom, accompanied by a male escort in white tie and tails as she took a bow. Dancing followed.
