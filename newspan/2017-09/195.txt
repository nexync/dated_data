Thirty-four years ago today, a faulty missile warning took the world close to its first nuclear exchange. But life as we know it continued thanks to one Soviet officer’s cool head.
In the early hours of Sept. 26, 1983, a Soviet computer system reported the launch of five Minuteman missiles. There were only minutes to counterattack before they could strike Soviet cities.
Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov was in charge of the system that day. He was skeptical, partly because the attack seemed too small. After tense analysis, and a report by satellite radar operators registering no missiles, he alerted his superiors to a false alarm. He later recalled it as a 50-50 decision.
He was right. A Soviet satellite had misinterpreted the sun’s reflection off clouds.
Colonel Petrov faded into obscurity until a memoir in the late 1990s highlighted his role. His death in May was widely reported only last week.
