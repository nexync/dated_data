GODZILLA VERSUS MOTHRA: James Patterson’s latest diversion, “The Store,” is about a mass-market behemoth standing astride the globe, anticipating and manipulating customers’ desires in a bid for total cultural domination. Surprisingly, it is not an autobiography. The store of the title is an Amazon-like tech company with management anger issues, which reacts murderously when it discovers that a couple of married employees plan a tell-all book. If nothing else, it will leave you questioning the wisdom of drone delivery.
