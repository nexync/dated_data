BERLIN — Angela Merkel won a fourth term as chancellor in elections on Sunday, placing her in the front ranks of Germany’s postwar leaders, even as her victory was dimmed by the entry of a far-right party into Parliament for the first time in more than 60 years, according to preliminary results.
Despite her victory, Ms. Merkel and her conservatives cannot lead alone, making it probable that the chancellor’s political life in her fourth term will be substantially more complicated.
But the step would also make sure that the AfD stays on the political sidelines and does not become the country’s official opposition.
The Alternative for Germany nonetheless vowed to shake the consensus politics of Germany, and in breaking a postwar taboo by entering Parliament, it already had.
Angela Merkel won a fourth term on Sunday as German chancellor. Her longevity in power has helped her cement her formidable position in Europe.
“It’s important to show that it’s not normal that a neofascist party got into the German Parliament,” said Dirk Schuck, 41, a political scientist at the University of Leipzig.
Even so, the advance of the far right was a cold slap for her and the Christian Democratic Union, or CDU. The AfD made particular inroads in the former East Germany but also in Bavaria, where Ms. Merkel’s sister party, the Christian Social Union, or CSU, has long led but lost some 10 percent of its vote over 2013.
The late leader of that party, Franz-Josef Strauss, said in 1986 that the party should allow no one to run to its right. “To the right of us there is only the wall,” he said.
Germany has a complicated system of proportional representation, in which each voter casts one ballot for a local representative and one ballot for a political party. Those elected locally get their seats.
