My cousin Blair Lee IV, quoted in your article, expressed his desire for statues of Robert E. Lee to remain where they are. I do not hold that opinion. Blair and I are descended from Robert E. Lee’s cousin, Adm. Samuel Phillips Lee, who was on the Union side.
I know that statues of Robert E. Lee provoke a spectrum of strong feelings and have become a magnet for civil unrest. To some people, both black and white, his statues are symbols of a fight for white supremacy. Others consider the statues as icons of war, not race.
Should these statues be in the public square? Governments do not usually honor those who have fought against them. In my opinion it is better to round them up and put them in a corral somewhere for a cooling-off period. Then when we, as a nation, have started being nicer to one another, we can put them on display at history museums and battlefields or — perhaps in a few cases — art museums. Or elsewhere, if our national discussion produces better ideas.
