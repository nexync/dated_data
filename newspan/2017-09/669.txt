The calls started flooding in from hundreds of irate North Carolina voters just after 7 a.m. on Election Day last November.
On Election Day last year, a number of counties reported problems similar to those in Durham. In North Carolina, paper roll incidents occurred in the counties that are home to the state’s largest cities, including Raleigh, Winston-Salem, Fayetteville and Charlotte. Three of Virginia’s most populous counties — Prince William, Loudoun, and Henrico — as well as Fulton County, Georgia, which includes Atlanta, and Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes Phoenix, also reported difficulties. All were attributed to software glitches.
