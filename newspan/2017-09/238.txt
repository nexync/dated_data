Elbaz also stressed how important it was to incorporate an element of surprise in her designs. At the time, Gimnes was fascinated by the dress of female icons from the 1950s, such as Madame Yevonde and Edwina Mountbatten. “They embraced their femininity while being sporty and independent, too,” she says. Taking heed of Elbaz’s advice, she added athletic details to ’50s-inspired silhouettes and utilized an offbeat palette of canary yellow, soft pink and ice blue. This, when combined with her spirited illustrations, culminates in a magical, madcap mix of fit-and-flare dresses with elastic buckle belts; fluid silk skirts with streamline stocking boots; oversize biker jackets with dramatic fur trims and even a one-piece topped off with a diaphanous cape. “I want people to see something of mine and know that it’s by Edda Gimnes,” she says.
