The N.F.L. suspended Josh Brown, a free-agent kicker, for six more games after spending nearly a year evaluating additional evidence related to charges of domestic violence.
Brown, who played 14 seasons with the Seahawks, Rams, Bengals and Giants, was originally suspended for one game last year after he admitted to the Giants that he had abused his wife.
But when the police in Washington State released documents last October that showed that Brown wrote about being “physically, verbally and emotionally” abusive to his wife, the Giants released him and the league suspended him indefinitely with pay.
Since then, the league has reviewed the documents and interviewed Brown again. That led to the decision to suspend him for six more games, which was first reported by ESPN and confirmed by a league official.
The suspension will have no bearing on any teams because Brown, 38, is a free agent. But the move comes as the league tries to fend off legal challenges to its decision to suspend Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott for six games without pay for his behavior during a six-day stretch in July 2016. His ex-girlfriend said he beat her five times during that period.
Elliott was not charged, and he and the N.F.L. Players Association have appealed the suspension. On Tuesday, a league-appointed arbitrator upheld the penalty, but Elliott will play on Sunday when the Cowboys face the Giants because the ruling occurred too late in the week.
The players’ association has asked a federal judge in Texas to overturn the suspension. The judge is expected to issue a ruling by the end of business on Friday.
The N.F.L., meanwhile, has asked a federal judge in New York to uphold the suspension. The league said New York is the proper venue to hear such cases because the league has its headquarters there. Not coincidentally, the league has won many cases in that court.
