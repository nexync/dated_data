The first rule of drama: If a group of irrepressible scamps find a contraband pistol in the first act, one of them has to lose a hand by the third act.
We know by now that in any season of “Outlander,” there are going to be episodes that exist to get our heroes where they need to go. Some of those are fun; some are merely serviceable. And some are “Surrender,” which has some solid character work, but also has some plot contrivances that stretch a little thin.
In theory, it’s good to be home at Lallybroch. Jamie’s sister Jenny and her family are trying to hang on as the British throw their weight around. Although we’re years past Culloden, hostilities have barely cooled, and there’s real tension and frustration as redcoats storm through the house or imprison Jenny’s husband, Ian, just because they can. But the plot ends up losing momentum as it tries to entangle Fergus, the contraband pistol, the vicious Redcoats and Jamie’s call to action.
This show loves to watch Jamie process trauma, but is often reluctant to give anyone else that time. (Most obviously, Jamie suffered for several episodes after he was raped, while Claire was expected to weather a series of sexual threats with almost no repercussions.) We saw it last season when Fergus’s rape at the hands of Black Jack Randall seemed to serve more as a catalyst for Jamie than as a character beat for Fergus. And when Fergus’s hand is hacked off, that’s treated much the same; once he realizes Jamie is more like himself again, Fergus is suspiciously well adjusted about it; it’s almost surreal how little it seems to matter, so long as Jamie’s better.
By the time Mary MacNab offers him a little human comfort, it doesn’t feel like romance so much as a relief; he’s so touch-starved he jolts at the touch of her hand. Even their halting conversation feels somehow intimate, as if that connection, more than the sex, will shore them up a little for whatever loneliness lies ahead.
That’s more than Claire can say.
Claire is a fascinating character, sometimes by design and sometimes by implication. But the actress Caitriona Balfe is putting energy into Claire’s sharp edges right now, and the result is both illuminating and a little crushing. It’s complicated by the fact that Frank seems to be doing his fumbling best. As far as we know, he supports Claire’s professional ambition (certainly we don’t see him make any objections to Claire’s attending medical school), and seems to be a loving father. That means that Claire isn’t fighting Frank. She’s fighting herself, which is more interesting.
Her struggle this episode is to wrench them both out of domestic limbo — a surprisingly painful piece of business, given that she doesn’t love him and they both already know. When she gets so touch-starved that she reaches out, he’s the one who’s startled. “I miss my husband,” she explains, which is the closest she can get to the truth, and before Frank kisses her back, a shadow of resignation passes over his eyes. It’s a flicker of misplaced passion, the beginning of a quiet collapse. By the end of this episode, even their bed has cracked — they sleep separately now. And although Claire is trying to still muster fondness toward him, we can tell how well that’s going.
The parallels between Jamie and Claire are obvious (“You can look at me if you like” / ”Open your eyes”), but equally telling are the differences. Jamie has the benefit of knowing himself: He takes time to mourn, he’s honest with Mary, and he decides his own fate. To keep steady in postwar Boston, Claire has had to push forward and hope that denial can be the same as healing. Now she knows it isn’t — and once again, she starts over.
• I laughed at the “wanted” poster of Jamie because I thought that glue-on beard was a wild caricature. It was not!
• Tobias Menzies is nicely underplaying Frank’s heartbreak. Frank got the technicality on everything he asked for — a wife, a child — and is realizing the cost.
• Claire is still torn between eras, thanks to those modern, tailored, old-Hollywood pajamas and that practically-a-banyan navy robe patterned with old-fashioned posies (more than a little 18th century).
• No wonder Millie has so many poisoning-her-husband jokes at the ready.
• “A woman and a Negro. How very modern of us.” Well, this bodes well for a nuanced subplot!
• Some very enthusiastic background stink eye from the med students.
