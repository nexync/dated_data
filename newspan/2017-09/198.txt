A Helping Hand, but Whose?
I was standing on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 73rd Street, waiting to cross. It was a crisp, sunny day, and, despite my 80 years, I was feeling strong and firm of foot. Just in case, though, I had brought along my cane because a recent snowfall had left some icy patches on the ground.
An older woman approached me and crooked her arm, indicating that she wanted help crossing the street. I was happy to be of service, so we hooked arms and proceeded cautiously across the avenue. I was extra careful to walk at the womanâ€™s slow pace.
When we reached the other side, she smiled at me sweetly.
