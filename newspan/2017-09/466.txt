Germans head to the polls Sunday, following a year of dramatic elections in Europe. The Netherlands, France, and Britain all held big, noisy votes that underscored the political volatility now infusing politics across the European Union. The German vote is effectively a referendum on Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is running for a fourth term. It is also critical because of Germany’s role as the economic and political leader of the Continent.
What follows is a guide to New York Times coverage of Ms. Merkel, Germany and Europe that can help you catch up on the election and the issues that have been roiling the region.
If you have time only for a few articles, start with this one by Melissa Eddy, our correspondent in Berlin. “Blunting the Far Right, Merkel Gains as German Election Nears” (Sept. 1) explains how Ms. Merkel has taken back the big issue that had animated her opponents on the far right: immigration.
Barely six months ago, after more than 11 years in power, the chancellor was vulnerable. Her immigration policies were unpopular and had buoyed a far right that was surging across Europe. Ms. Merkel herself appeared ambivalent about another run as polls showed voters tiring of her.
No longer. Today, the chancellor’s center-right Christian Democratic Union draws as much as 40 percent support, enough to lead a new coalition. Ms. Merkel’s position is so secure, many political observers have already shifted their focus from who will win the election to whom she will choose to form her next government.

What happened to Martin Schulz? For your next stop, find out how the campaign of Ms. Merkel's main rival fizzled (Sept. 18). Mr. Schulz, of the center-left Social Democrats, once was considered to have a real chance of winning the chancellorship, but just days before the election, Ms. Merkel’s party leads his by double digits in polls.
On Sept. 3, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Schulz clashed over Turkey and refugee policies in their only televised debate.
The flip side of what our Op-Ed contributor Lukas Hermsmeier calls a “reassuringly boring” election? It could be a victory for the nationalistic far right: The Alternative for Germany party is poised to enter Parliament for the first time in 60 years. Read about how this party is poised to break a postwar taboo.
Ms. Merkel is widely expected to win. Her re-election would reinforce her position as one of the most powerful women in the world, and a strong counterpart to President Trump in the United States and President Vladimir V. Putin in Russia.
An increasingly divided Europe is looking to Germany, its richest power, to cope with its many problems, some of them longstanding: low growth, a continuing stream of refugees, and increasingly angry and nationalistic electorates.
We also took a look at Ms. Merkel and Mr. Trump, two powerful leaders “estranged by widely diverging temperaments, worldviews, leadership styles and visions of Europe.” Ms. Merkel — who, in more than 11 years in power, has “proved uncommonly adept at solving the puzzle-box challenges posed by the world’s most unpredictable leaders” — may realize there isn’t a method for dealing with Mr. Trump.
And to understand Ms. Merkel’s relationship with Mr. Putin, dig in to this comprehensive piece on their rivalry of history, distrust and power (Mar. 12) by Ms. Smale and Andrew Higgins, a Moscow correspondent.
The article includes a nugget about talks between the two leaders in 2007: Mr. Putin let his large black Labrador into their meeting room, after the Kremlin had been told that Ms. Merkel was uneasy around dogs.
If Ms. Merkel’s party, the Christian Democratic Union, wins as expected, the Social Democrats will probably be in second place. But there is a close race for third among the smaller parties to build a coalition government.
The Left, the Greens, the pro-business Free Democratic Party and the nationalist, populist Alternative for Germany are all polling just below 10 percent, meaning there may be four smaller parties in the next Parliament. Such a constellation would open the possibility for a different governing coalition, depending on whether the center-left Social Democrats, or the center-right Christian Democratic Union — who vote as a bloc with their Bavaria-only partners, the Christian Social Union — emerge as the strongest force.
The outcome may not be a surprise, but any election brings forward important issues. Germans are focused on immigration, potential hacking attacks and leaks, and the rise of Alternative for Germany, which formed in 2013.
Ms. Merkel’s decision two years ago to throw open Germany’s doors to those seeking political asylum remains a vulnerable point for her. While stressing in her stump speech that 2015 must remain an exception, she has praised communities like Weimar, which Ms. Eddy and Rick Lyman, our Warsaw bureau chief, followed for months to learn how Germans and Syrians have adapted.
Those close relations between public officials and car manufacturers were once considered vital economic policy for Germany’s most important export. 
Jim Rutenberg, our media columnist, wrote recently from Berlin about the potential release of a trove of political secrets that hackers have gathered over the past couple of years, including in a 2015 attack on the German Parliament, and how journalists might cover such a leak.
“Hackers Came, but the French Were Prepared” (May 9) is a good exploration of how French news outlets and politicians handled a hacking attack just hours before a legal ban on election reporting went into effect.
Much of the attention trained on Germany has focused on the rise of the far right. Early this year, Amanda Taub, a writer for The Interpreter, a column and newsletter, visited Germany to see how far-right populism has taken root in Europe. Read about Buch, “a cozy, safe neighborhood” emblematic of the forces “threatening to upend Western politics as we know it,” and delve into how Germany’s taboos, once a bulwark against the far right, may now be enabling it.

If you have time for a longer read, you can’t do much better than “The New Europeans,” a Times Magazine article by James Angelos, a writer based in Berlin. Mr. Angelos traveled to Siegsdorf, in southwestern Bavaria, last year to see how the village was grappling with the influx of refugees placed there — and with the question of what it means to be German.
A good place to start pondering the issues facing Europe as a whole is “The Questions That Could Reshape a Worried Europe in 2017” (Jan. 28). Among them: Will Turkey turn away from Europe? Will the United States stand with Europe? Will nationalists triumph elsewhere?
The Interpreter, again, offers a great overview in Uncertainty, More Than Populism, Is New Normal in Western Politics (June 10).
When issues and candidates fit a broadly similar mold year after year, voting tends to follow predictable patterns. But populism has introduced a new, or at least newly powerful, set of factors, forcing anyone who works in or studies politics to throw out long-held models.
If you haven’t yet listened to The Daily, The Times’s audio news report, start with this episode. The host, Michael Barbaro, talked with the writers of The Interpreter about the perception — and reality — of the far right’s rise across the Continent.
Islamic extremists have carried out over a dozen deadly terror attacks in Western Europe since 2015.
The metropolis that globalization created may well be the capital of the world. But after the “Brexit” referendum, its future as an international crossroads is far from certain.
