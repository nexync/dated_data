SYDNEY, Australia — The first group of refugees from Australia’s offshore detention centers is expected to leave for the United States “in the coming weeks,” Australia’s prime minister announced Wednesday.
In a video shared on social media, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull thanked President Trump for honoring a deal reached by the Obama administration, which Mr. Trump had criticized, in which the United States agreed to accept hundreds of refugees from the centers, one on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and one on Nauru, an island nation to the east.
An official with the State Department confirmed that 54 approved refugees would be notified in the coming days and travel to the United States in the coming weeks. Little is known about the group, but the official said that the refugees were similar in makeup to other groups that country admits for resettlement.
Asylum seekers who tried to reach Australia by boat were sent to the detention centers while their refugee claims were considered. Many have been waiting for years, often in harsh conditions.
The potential closure of the Manus processing center would not affect the eligibility of those referred by the United Nations refugee agency for resettlement consideration, and others are expected to be resettled in the coming months, the State Department official said. The United States would identify an alternative processing location on Manus if required, the official said.
Many have since questioned whether Mr. Trump would honor the agreement.
Elaine Pearson, Australia director of Human Rights Watch, said the deal was being used by the Australian government as a distraction.
Australia’s Department of Immigration and Border Security would not answer questions on the matter and referred to statements from Mr. Turnbull and from Peter Dutton, the Australian immigration minister. “I repeat that we will not be providing running commentary on this matter,” his statement read.
