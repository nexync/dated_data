Chris Perkel’s reverent documentary “Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives” is a valedictory for Mr. Davis, the music executive whose Midas touch with radio hits across genres — especially at Arista Records, from 1975-2000 — is industry legend. The career of Mr. Davis, now 85, covering the 1960s to the present, is remarkable when you consider his longevity and resilience given pop music’s core audience of young listeners. Entertainment luminaries — Aretha Franklin, Puff Daddy, Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith, Alicia Keys and many others — attest to his golden ear and marketplace savvy.
Later discoveries included Barry Manilow, whose debut album, Mr. Davis felt, needed a hit; he recommended the song that became “Mandy,” which exploded on radio. It was Mr. Davis who masterminded “Smooth,” Carlos Santana’s 1990 smash collaboration with Rob Thomas; its album, “Supernatural,” reinvigorated Mr. Santana’s career and earned a Grammy.
The film’s tragic figure is Whitney Houston, whom Mr. Davis had mentored since her adolescence. He adored her, and yet all his formidable power could not save the self-destructive singer, after years of drug use, from herself. She died hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy party hosted by Mr. Davis.
