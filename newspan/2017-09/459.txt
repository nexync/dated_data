The discovery of C.T.E. adds another turn in Mr. Hernandez’s meteoric rise and fall. After a standout career at Florida, he was signed by the Patriots in 2010. Just years before, he had been working menial jobs in Bristol, Conn., his hardscrabble hometown, where he drove a $300 used car he bought with money borrowed from friends.
At Florida, he helped the Gators win the national title in the 2008 season. But he fell to the fourth round of the N.F.L. draft because of off-field issues including involvement in a bar fight.
Less than a year after he signed the contract with the Patriots that might have provided a stable future, his friend was found murdered. His conviction in the case became a stark example of N.F.L. players who exhibit violence off the field.
Even his demise was filled with turmoil. After Mr. Hernandez died, Mr. Baez called a news conference in front of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner and accused the state of illegally withholding Mr. Hernandez’s brain. Mr. Hernandez’s body had been discovered the day before, tied with a bedsheet to the window of his prison cell in Shirley, Mass. His death was later ruled a suicide.
