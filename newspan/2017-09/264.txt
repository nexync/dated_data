Tempted to Worry? Try Making Concrete Plans Instead.
Worry is a terrible business strategy.
In the not so distant past, however, it was the only one I knew.
I took my wife’s advice, and instead of constant worry, I now try to do something more productive. I make plans.
And then I take Plans X, Y and Z, place them in the file cabinet and stop thinking about them.
That’s it. I don’t need to worry about those scenarios anymore because I have a plan.
Action is a business strategy. Worry is not. So make a plan, put it away for safekeeping and get back to work.
