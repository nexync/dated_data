There’s a slight and not unpleasing paradox at the heart of Julia Solomonoff’s smart and engaging new movie, “Nobody’s Watching.” It is an uncommonly unhurried film about a character for whom time is running out.
Nico is an attractive young man from Buenos Aires, living in New York. As the movie opens on a bright spring day, he’s not up to much. He looks after a friend’s baby and won’t take money for it. He tools around Manhattan and Brooklyn on a bike. In a park, a group of Spanish-speaking women note his resemblance to an actor on an Argentine TV drama called “Rivales.” He shrugs it off with a nondenial-denial.
Nico, played with unforced depth by Guillermo Pfening, actually is that actor. He’s in the United States because he’s tired of soap opera work (he’s also fleeing a failed love affair). He is promised a movie role in New York and doesn’t mind waiting tables while the production supposedly comes together.
It’s emblematic of this film’s tone that the role falls through — putting his work visa situation into a bad bind — a half-hour into the movie. “Nobody’s Watching” addresses immigration issues head on, but it’s more about being set existentially adrift.
Humiliations follow, including an encounter with an arrogant American film insider who bluntly tells Nico to darken his hair — his blond hair doesn’t exude stereotypical Latino vibes. His friendships suffer — the mother of the child he babysits for takes umbrage when he chats up a potential professional connection at her yoga class — as does his self-esteem after a fraught visit from a mentor who’s also a former lover.
Ms. Solomonoff, an Argentine filmmaker based in New York, doesn’t fail to include scenes of stranger-in-a-strange-land exhilaration. This movie is as attached to our town as it is to Nico, even if Nico might not be destined to stay.
