In Tecate, Mexico, a little boy with dark hair and curious eyes peers carefully over the barrier wall that borders San Diego County. Rising up almost 70 feet, his hands seemingly grip the barrier tightly, as if he were holding onto his mother’s body.
The French artist JR pasted that plaintive image on Wednesday, his first installation in Mexico. The piece, based on his photo of a 1-year-old who lives with his mother and grandparents in Tecate, is fully viewable only from the American side of the divide.
The idea came to JR in a dream. “Some people dream about fantasy worlds, I dream about walls,” he said in a phone interview. And though his artwork was not intended as a direct response to the Trump administration, it has extra resonance this week as the White House moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that shields young undocumented immigrants from deportation.
The United States-Mexico border has been especially fertile ground for artists lately. In Tijuana, the Japanese collective Chim Pom built a treehouse called the “USA Visitors Center,” that JR visited. An American photographer, Richard Misrach, and a Mexican composer, Guillermo Galindo, have joined forces to craft instruments from the objects migrants leave behind. And the Oscar-winning Mexican director Alejandro G. Iñárritu created “Carne y Arena,” an immersive virtual-reality exhibition that simulates crossing the border. It’s currently on view at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
