The five living former United States presidents joined forces on Thursday to start a hurricane recovery effort to raise money for victims of Hurricane Harvey in Texas.
The fund-raising effort is focused on people affected by Hurricane Harvey, the destructive storm that dumped more than 50 inches of rain in parts of southeast Texas and caused billions of dollars in damages and lost economic activity. The state is of particular importance for President Bush, who was governor there in the 1990s, and his father, President George Bush, who lives part of the year in Houston.
The campaign is expected to expand to help those hurt by Irma. That storm, an enormous Category 5 hurricane churning through the Caribbean, is forecast to turn toward South Florida over the next day and then strike Georgia, where former President Jimmy Carter lives.
The presidents have a history of coming together to help victims of natural disasters. President Bill Clinton teamed up with the man he defeated in the 1992 presidential election, George Bush, to raise money after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005. President Barack Obama asked Mr. Clinton and George W. Bush to lead an effort to help Haiti after an earthquake in 2010. The Clinton Bush Haiti Fund raised $54.4 million.
Donations to One Appeal America will go to a special restricted account created through the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library Foundation, which will distribute the money to two charities, the Houston Harvey Relief Fund and the Rebuild Texas Fund. Donations can be made online at oneamericaappeal.org.
