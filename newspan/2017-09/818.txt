This is in addition to a rich and growing body of digital resources, including dozens of videos documenting past festivals; a podcast of interviews with artists; an open-source database of hundreds of contemporary works; and 150 Days of Vocal Music, which for the past few months has dropped a recorded piece every 24 hours leading up to the festival next week.
It’s an impressive achievement for an outfit that began just four years ago, mostly as a way for Ms. Dhegrae to force singers she knew to hear one another perform. She was the first artist to appear on the very first night, and scheduled friends who were O.K. with an eight-way split of the modest ($1,800) ticket sales.
The budget has steadily grown, but even with newfound backing from private foundations, the financial balancing act is daunting. Ms. Dhegrae doesn’t want to have to rely on annual crowdsourcing appeals to close gaps, and she wants to raise artist fees.
The 2017 artists run the festival’s characteristic gamut, from Theo Bleckmann’s avant-cabaret to Jennifer Walshe’s meditations on the dark side of video games. Davóne Tines’s program started as part of “Requiem for a Tuesday,” his project about remembering young black men killed by the police; it represents both his roots in gospel and his present career, immersed in contemporary repertory.
Joan La Barbara, a veteran of the new-music scene, shares an evening with the science-obsessed Hai-Ting Chinn and the movement-based Odeya Nini. Each of the final night’s mini-concerts — by Mary Bonhag, Kamala Sankaram and Kayleigh Butcher — will offer concentrated flurries of works.
Intuition guides Ms. Dhegrae’s lineup choices, supported by a numerical rubric she’s concocted — spreadsheet and all — that helps to ensure a healthy mix of approaches. (Not too many operatic-style voices at once, please!) She’s ended up with a vocal tasting that dives both deep and wide, taking in a broad swath of a bewilderingly varied scene.
