With the blessing of the European Union, Italy is offshoring its Mediterranean migration problem to a former colony, Libya. The goal is to prevent mostly sub-Saharan African migrants from leaving Libya’s shores for Europe. But the tactics could further destabilize Libya and condemn migrants to more misery.
Italy’s interior minister, Marco Minniti, isn’t shy about why his country has moved to beef up Libya’s coast guard, strike deals with tribesmen who control Libya’s southern border, persuade clan-based militias to prevent boats from leaving Libya and promise Libyan mayors sources of revenue to replace profits stemming from trafficking. It’s all about keeping populist parties from fanning migration fears ahead of Italy’s elections next spring.
The results are astonishing: The flow of migrants crossing the Mediterranean was 85 percent less last month than in the previous August. While Mr. Minniti denies direct payments to militias or traffickers, it’s hard to believe that European money committed to limiting migration isn’t reaching these groups.
It is inhumane to warehouse migrants in Libya, where they face abuse. They should be rescued, and asylum applications processed more quickly, with people ruled ineligible sent to their country of origin. Italy needs to be relieved of sole responsibility, for this is a European problem.
The European Union, the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration are working to improve dire conditions for migrants in Libya. The sad fact is, though, that Europe is so determined to stop people from getting to Italy that it is abandoning human rights to quell European anti-migration sentiment.
