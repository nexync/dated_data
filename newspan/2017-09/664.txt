New Yorkers have voted, and Spike Lee’s “Crooklyn” is the winner of One Film, One New York, in which the whole city is invited to watch the same movie on the same night.
A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, the chief film critics of The New York Times, had picked five finalists — the others were “Desperately Seeking Susan,” “New York, New York,” “On the Town” and “The Wedding Banquet” — and in August residents voted for their favorite.
On Sept. 13 the movie will be screened for free at parks and theaters in all five boroughs. (The project is being sponsored by the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment and The Times.) For more details, go to nyc.gov/onefilmny.
