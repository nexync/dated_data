This is the second movie in 20 years in which Judi Dench plays Queen Victoria. And this is the second movie in 20 years in which Queen Victoria, played by Judi Dench, has a life-enhancing relationship with a man not of her station. This movie, “Victoria and Abdul,” directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Lee Hall, goes 1997’s “Mrs. Brown” one better in the Relevant to Contemporary Concerns department by depicting a friendship between the second-longest-reigning monarch of England and an Indian Muslim.
“Based on real events … mostly,” reads a text at the movie’s opening. Queen Victoria’s first encounters with Abdul Karim (Ali Fazal), an Indian functionary sent to Britain to present her with a ceremonial coin, are in comedic scenes that lampoon the pomp of her court. The material is broad, and funny. The Queen is struck by Abdul’s bearing and handsomeness, and soon enough is receiving him in private audiences and having him tutor her in Urdu. He becomes her “munshi” (teacher) and his presence in her life invigorates her. Much to the displeasure of her actual court, including her son and heir “Bertie” (a.k.a. Edward VII), played with a beard and fiercely indignant eyebrows by Eddie Izzard.
In the shift from comedy to drama the movie goes wobbly. The narrative of cross-cultural understanding by way of individual affinity is a comforting but ultimately dubious one. The notion of Queen Victoria as the most progressive figure of the Victorian age is also peculiar. But this is a handsomely packaged collection of such notions, and will provide genteel entertainment to those of a mind to swallow them.
