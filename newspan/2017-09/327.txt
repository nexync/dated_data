• North Korea’s nuclear program and repeated missile tests will be a major focal point as world leaders gather in New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly.
President Trump, who appeared to refer to the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, as “Rocket Man” in a tweet, delivers his centerpiece speech to the assembly on Tuesday. He has lunch on Thursday with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, who, in an Op-Ed, argues for stronger enforcement of the sanctions against the North.
Our reporters note U.S. intelligence is trying to determine if ingredients for the unusually powerful fuel the North used in its latest launch may be flowing into the country from China and Russia.
Many of the leaders will be scrutinizing Mr. Trump, who is attending for the first time, to see how his America First approach fits into the U.N.’s world-first mission. One indication: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has slashed the usual contingent of U.S. diplomats. He’ll meet representatives of Iraq, India, Russia and Myanmar.
• The Rohinyga crisis is also certain to be prominent at the U.N. meetings.
More than half of the 400,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh in recent weeks are children, and many are without their parents. The military violence driving them out came in response to an attack by a new generation of radicalized Rohingya.
Bangladesh plans to construct 14,000 shelters, each able to house six families, near the border in the next 10 days.
• Britain has lowered its terrorism threat level after arresting two men in connection with Friday’s bombing of a London subway station, in which a rudimentary explosive device injured dozens.
President Trump’s tweets about the attack, which asserted that the assailants had been known to Scotland Yard, strained relations with British leaders.
Philippine troops are closing in on Islamic State-inspired militants in the war-torn city of Marawi, according to the country’s defense minister.
And a priest who had been held captive since May was freed amid the heavy fighting.

On this day in 1973, Jimmy Carter, then governor of Georgia, filled out a report saying that he had seen a U.F.O.
It wasn’t such a strange statement at the time — a Gallup poll that year found that 51 percent of people interviewed believed in unidentified flying objects, and that 11 percent believed they had seen “a flying saucer” themselves.
Mr. Carter filed his report with the unofficial National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, and said he had seen the object in Leary, Ga., in 1969.
But he added that he believed it was impossible “to have space people from other planets or other stars” come to Earth.
While he didn’t believe they could visit us, Mr. Carter did record a message for “possible unknown civilizations in the galaxies” as president. It was part of the golden record placed in the Voyager in August 1977.
