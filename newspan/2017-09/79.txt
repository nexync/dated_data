A picture caption on Thursday with an article about President Moon Jae-in of South Korea misidentified an official shown at the United Nations General Assembly listening to President Trump’s speech. He is Cho Tae-yul, South Korea’s ambassador to the United Nations, not President Moon.
An obituary on Sept. 14 about the author J. P. Donleavy misstated his birth name and his father’s name. He was born James Patrick Dunleavy, not James Patrick Donleavy Jr., and his father was Patrick John Dunleavy, not James Donleavy. (The spelling of the family name was later changed.) The obituary also referred incorrectly to Mr. Donleavy’s survivors. He did not have grandchildren. And the obituary misstated the name of a manuscript on which he had been working. It was “The Dog on the 17th Floor,” not “The Dog That Fell From the 17th Floor.” Because of an editing error, the obituary also misstated the surname of the college classmate who inspired the title character of Mr. Donleavy’s novel “The Ginger Man.” He was Gainor Steven Crist, not Cris.
An obituary on Thursday about the boxer Jake LaMotta misspelled part of the name of the character he played in a 1965 production of “Guys and Dolls.” The character is Big Jule, not Big Julie.
An obituary on Sept. 15 about the actor Gastone Moschin misidentified the street festival during which Don Fanucci, the character he played, is killed in “The Godfather Part II.” It is the festival of San Rocco, not San Gennaro.
