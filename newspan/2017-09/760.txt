Grady Hendrix’s “Paperbacks From Hell” beautifully displays the cover designs for hundreds of mass-market horror novels. Some of the designs are lovely; many are so hideous that they almost bend back toward lovely.
The “horror paperback boom,” Hendrix says, dates from the late 1960s (“after ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ hit the big time”) to the early ’90s (“after the success of ‘Silence of the Lambs’ convinced marketing departments to scrape the word horror off spines and glue on the word thriller instead”). The boom may have ended, but it lives — vividly, gruesomely — in this collection.
