MEXICO CITY — Guatemalan legislators on Monday overwhelmingly voted to keep President Jimmy Morales’s immunity from prosecution, a measure that protects him from a campaign finance investigation that has roiled the country’s politics.
The vote in Congress rejected a request from Guatemala’s attorney general and the head of a United Nations anticorruption panel, which last month described a series of violations by Mr. Morales’s party and two other parties during the 2015 election campaign.
With so many legislators embroiled in questions over campaign finance, the congressional vote not to remove the president’s immunity appeared to be a decision to close ranks against the investigation.
The vote does not halt the investigation, Mr. Rodríguez said, and prosecutors will continue their broader inquiry into the parties and the companies that financed their campaigns. But it prevents investigators from looking at Mr. Morales’s role directly.
Mr. Morales plunged the country into a political crisis two days after the case against his party was announced by ordering Ivan Velásquez, the head of the United Nations anticorruption panel, expelled from the country. A professorial Colombian prosecutor, Mr. Velásquez has become a hero to many Guatemalans for his unflinching pursuit of corruption.
Two years ago, an investigation by the panel and the attorney general into a customs fraud ring led to an outpouring of citizen protest that ultimately forced President Otto Pérez Molina to resign. He is awaiting trial on a series of corruption charges.
Guatemala’s constitutional court threw out the expulsion order against Mr. Velásquez, and the whole episode severely weakened the president.
