Susan Vreeland, who drew on her love of art to fashion well-regarded novels about paintings and those who paint or own them, died on Aug. 23 in San Diego. She was 71.
The cause was complications of heart surgery, her longtime agent, Barbara Braun, said.
Among Ms. Vreeland’s best-known books is her second novel, “Girl in Hyacinth Blue” (1999), about a fictional painting that may be a lost Vermeer. It traces the painting’s various owners through history, illuminating them, their times and the artwork. She wrote the book while being treated for lymphoma.
Susan Joyce Vreeland was born on Jan. 20, 1946, in Racine, Wis. Her father, William Vreeland, was a manager in the aerospace industry; her mother, the former Esther Jancovius, had a longstanding interest in art.
Ms. Vreeland lived much of her life in San Diego, where she taught high school for many years, retiring in 2002. She graduated from San Diego State University.
Her first book, “What Love Sees,” came out in 1988, but it was “Girl in Hyacinth Blue” that brought her wide attention.
Ms. Vreeland’s best-known book was published in 1999.
“Intelligent, searching and unusual, the novel is filled with luminous moments,” Katy Emck said in reviewing the book in The New York Times. In 2003, the book was turned into a made-for-television movie, “Brush With Fate,” starring Ellen Burstyn and Glenn Close.
Ms. Vreeland’s husband, Joseph Gray, whom she married in 1988, recalled how a particular scene in that book came about. He had already gone to bed one night when Ms. Vreeland, working late, nudged him with a question.
Ms. Vreeland, who is also survived by a sister, Nancy, continued to write novels grounded in art, among them “The Passion of Artemisia” (2002), which drew on the life of Artemisia Gentileschi; “Luncheon of the Boating Party” (2007), inspired by the Renoir painting; and “Lisette’s List” (2014), about a young woman with a love of artworks.
They included a newlywed couple from Brazil.
