The 20-page will, prepared in 2004, was filed in Surrogate’s Court in Manhattan on Friday. It said Mr. Bowie’s estate was worth as much as $100 million, but it contained no breakdown of his holdings.
... Mr. Bowie left $2 million to Corinne Schwab, who is known as Coco and was his longtime personal assistant. In a codicil from 2007, he left Ms. Schwab his stock in a company called Opossum Inc. He left $1 million to Marion Skene, who was Mr. Jones’s nanny.
