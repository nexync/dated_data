The American Red Cross agrees that donors must be sure that “a vast majority of their contributions will go to the people whose plight moved them to give.” That’s why we pledge that 91 cents of every dollar we receive for Hurricane Harvey will fund our efforts in Texas and Louisiana.
Only 1 to 2 percent of our budget comes from the government. That’s why we must ask for public support. You call that “promotion,” but telling the story is vital to helping disaster victims in need.
When we send an army of volunteers into a chaotic disaster, we know that things will go wrong. But we work to fulfill our mission no matter the challenges, and we always strive to do the right thing.
The American Red Cross encourages people to donate to the charity of their choice. But please do donate, because these affected communities need our help.
The writer is president and chief executive of the American Red Cross.
