WASHINGTON â€” The acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration will resign at the end of the week, according to law enforcement officials, who said he had become convinced that President Trump had little respect for the law.
Mr. Rosenberg, who was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2015, is a career prosecutor. Under President George W. Bush, he served as the United States attorney in both southern Texas and eastern Virginia.
In late July, Mr. Rosenberg, told the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, that he did not want to be considered as the permanent administrator of the D.E.A. Mr. Rosenstein, who wrote a memo that Mr. Trump briefly cited as his rationale for dismissing Mr. Comey, then asked whether Mr. Rosenberg wanted to remain at the Justice Department, and Mr. Rosenberg said he did not.
