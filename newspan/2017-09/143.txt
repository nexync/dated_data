What becomes of hope? After the cheers die down and the confetti is swept up, what happens to the initial rush of excitement that a candidate can inspire?
In “Thanks, Obama” Litt takes stock of the Obama administration’s legacy as someone who dedicated a portion of his life to it and, more important, as someone who believed in it. While he frames himself as a simple romantic comedy hero — wide-eyed, a bit hapless, prone to slapstick — he wrestles with larger ideas of optimism in the face of cynicism.
When, however, Litt’s journey dovetails with the more historical, headline-grabbing elements, the memoir soars. Many events, like the death of Osama bin Laden, occurred outside of Litt’s purview in the White House, and so he is unable to offer much additional insight. But after Obama’s re-election, Litt’s position is elevated and the book’s narrative engine receives a major boost. A chapter titled “Bucket,” about a dramatic change in Obama’s approach to messaging that coincides with Litt’s promotion, is particularly excellent. It crackles with insights into political processes, colored by human reactions and the comedic foibles one has come to expect.
“Thanks, Obama” is similarly alchemical, wringing comedy, pathos and a nation’s hope out of one man’s stumble through the halls of power. While the first half of the book is enjoyable, the second half is masterly, rising to a crescendo that is as rousing as, well, a particularly inspiring campaign speech.
