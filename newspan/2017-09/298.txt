The free-agent catcher Derek Norris was suspended Friday for the rest of the season for violating Major League Baseball’s domestic violence policy.
Norris was released by the Tampa Bay Rays in late June, several weeks after his former fiancée Kristen Eck wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post that Norris verbally and physically abused her in 2015.
Norris, who cooperated with M.L.B. investigators, as he is required to do, denied the accusations in a statement released by M.L.B. But he is not appealing his suspension and will forfeit the remaining $100,000 that is owed to him by the Rays, who will donate it to charities that treat victims of domestic violence.
Norris, 28, is the fifth major league player to be disciplined under baseball’s domestic violence policy, which was instituted two years after negotiations with the players’ union. A former All-Star, Norris was the first player to be disciplined after claims came to light on social media, as opposed to through the police.
M.L.B. is currently investigating another such case involving Chicago Cubs shortstop Addison Russell. After Russell’s wife, Melisa, wrote on Instagram that Russell had cheated on her, a friend of Melisa Russell’s posted that Addison Russell had hit his wife in front of his two young children. Addison Russell, who is in the midst of a divorce from his wife, has denied the accusation.
