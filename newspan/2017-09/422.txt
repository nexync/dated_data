This week’s Evian Championship, the L.P.G.A.’s fifth major championship, is the last chance for women to win a major in 2017. Here are some players to watch in Evian-les-Bains, France. Statistics are from the week of Sept. 4.
The top-ranked player in the world, Ryu is seeking her third major victory, after wins at the 2011 U.S. Women’s Open and the 2017 ANA Inspiration. A South Korean, she leads the L.P.G.A. in top-10 finishes (59 percent) with 10 in 2017, including two wins. She tied for second with Sung Hyun Park at the 2016 Evian.
The South Korean is on track to win the L.P.G.A.’s top rookie honors. Ranked No. 3 in the world, Park leads the tour’s season money list and is second in scoring average (69.00), and has posted seven top-10 finishes in 2017, including wins at the U.S. Women’s Open and Canadian Pacific Women’s Open. She tied for second with Ryu at the 2016 Evian.
Thompson has emerged as the top American and is No. 2 in the world rankings with nine top-10s this year, including two wins and five runner-up finishes. On the L.P.G.A., she is first in scoring average (68.88), first in greens in regulation (78.29 percent) and third in driving-distance average (276.07 yards) and in earnings (more than $1.65 million). A victory in Indianapolis last week gives the Floridian momentum to win her 10th career title and second major championship.
Kim is having the best season of her 11-year career with three victories in 2017. She won the ShopRite L.P.G.A. Classic in June, the Marathon Classic in July and the Ricoh Women’s British Open in August, rising to seventh in the world rankings and fifth on the L.P.G.A. money list. A win at Evian, where she tied for third in 2011, would be the South Korean’s eighth tour title and second major championship.
Henderson, in her third year on the L.P.G.A. tour, is hunting for her second major championship and fifth career L.P.G.A. victory. The Canadian, who turned 20 Sunday, has five top-10s in 2017 with a win at the Meijer L.P.G.A. Classic. She finished in a tie for ninth at last year’s Evian Championship.
Ciganda has two career L.P.G.A. wins, but has never won a major championship. At 22nd, the Spaniard is the second-highest ranked European (behind Sweden’s Anna Nordqvist), but is one of the most dynamic, long-hitting European players in women’s golf. She broke through to win in 2016, adding her second L.P.G.A. victory within a month, so momentum is crucial for her.
