This poem speaks with the authority of a sermon. A case for divine imperfection is made from the pulpit. Pretend you are in the audience, a member of a strange congregation. Is the preacher reprimanding your devotion, is she praising the godsâ€™ humanity, is this a call for spiritual revolt? Unfortunately, you are not allowed to raise your hand with questions during a sermon. Instead the message must be absorbed, inhaled, hummed and pondered in the quiet after the service.
