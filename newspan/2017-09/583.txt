The popular folk singer and songwriter Dar Williams’s new book, “What I Found in a Thousand Towns,” is not another in the endless parade of music memoirs. Having performed around the United States for so many years, Williams writes about how she believes towns can best thrive in an age of economic and environmental struggles. The key, she says, is “positive proximity,” or “a state of being where living side by side with other people is experienced as beneficial.” She gets more specific, analyzing policies around housing, food and energy, everywhere from Beacon, N.Y., to Gainesville, Fla. It reads as if Pete Seeger and Jane Jacobs teamed up, more a report from the Green Party than the green room.
