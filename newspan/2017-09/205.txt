In the realm of baseball espionage, this was about as low-tech as it gets: A fan with a good view of the catcher and a strong set of lungs.
That was all it took on Tuesday night for that fan to be ejected from Yankee Stadium for yelling out information on pitch location to the Yankees’ Gary Sanchez while he was hitting in the eighth inning of his team’s 6-1 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays.
This was, for sure, not anything like the recent sign-stealing case involving the Boston Red Sox, who had a member of their training staff wearing an Apple Watch in a fairly high-tech bid to let their hitters know what pitch might be coming.
That effort appeared to involve Red Sox personnel gleaning information about a catcher’s signals off video feeds of the game, rapidly getting that information to the dugout via the watch and then verbally conveying that information to players on the field.
In contrast, the fan on Tuesday was apparently watching the Rays catcher shift his body to set a target for the next pitch and then yelling out what he had just observed. No Apple Watch required.
But after the fan’s booming voice was heard by Sanchez; the Rays’ catcher, Wilson Ramos; and the home-plate umpire, Dan Bellino, he was pointed out to stadium security and removed from the stadium. The fan has not been identified.
After the fan was ejected, Sanchez hit a bloop single to drive in the Yankees’ fifth run.
