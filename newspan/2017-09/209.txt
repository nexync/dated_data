In the wake of the tragic deaths of nursing home residents in Florida, the country should be alerted to the little-known fact that many American nursing homes lack air-conditioning. If air-conditioning is present, it is often available only in common areas such as hallways and dining rooms.
This, of course, represents millions of dollars of cost savings to the nursing home industry, while causing illness and death among overheated elderly people whose bodies are ill equipped to deal with hyperthermic stress.
It is time that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and state health departments require air-conditioning as a right — and not a luxury — for nursing home residents.
