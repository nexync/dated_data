The comedian Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, whose anti-Semitic comments have put him at the center of a free-speech debate in France, said on Thursday that he had been detained at the Hong Kong Airport and barred from entering the territory.
The comedian was convicted in March of condoning terrorism in France after he posted a Facebook message suggesting sympathy with one of the gunmen involved in the January 2015 attacks in Paris that left over a dozen people dead.
A separate free-speech ruling was upheld in November by the European Court of Human Rights, which said that Mr. M’bala M’bala’s right to expression did not permit him to make anti-Semitic jokes or statements denying the Holocaust.
Hong Kong has a significant French population, estimated at close to 20,000, and Mr. M’bala M’bala’s was traveling to the city to perform “Dieudonné en paix” (Dieudonné in peace) on Thursday and Friday at a venue in Cyberport, a development on the western part of Hong Kong Island.
A booking website was selling tickets to the shows for 420 Hong Kong dollars, or about $54. The Cyberport management company would not confirm that the shows had been canceled, saying only that the performances were a “private booking” in a restaurant.
The shows were to take place at the Arcade Center, according to the Facebook page for the event, and 42 people were said to be attending.
