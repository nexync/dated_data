“Jane Got a Gun,” a western directed by Gavin O’Connor, is a prime example of what French critics used to call a “film maudit,” or cursed film. The production, started in early 2013, was thrown into disarray when its original director, the visionary Lynne Ramsay, left mere days into shooting. At least two key cast and crew members followed her. In addition, the movie’s original distributor, Relativity Media, lost the rights to the picture in a bankruptcy proceeding. The final film was released by the Weinstein Company, without screenings for reviewers.
Under such circumstances one hopes for, if not a lost masterpiece, then something quirky and entertaining. The tale of a frontier wife, Jane (Natalie Portman), in the New Mexico Territory, enlisting a former lover (Joel Edgerton) to defend home and hearth after her husband has been laid low did not seem to be an unreasonable scenario. I was hoping for something along the lines of a gender-reversed “Shane,” with Noah Emmerich (he plays the husband) in the Jean Arthur role. No such luck.
Instead, Mr. O’Connor presides over a somber slog, full of gorgeous vistas nicely captured by the cinematographer Mandy Walker. The strife-filled story isn’t made more engaging through a lumbering structure made up of flashbacks. Ewan McGregor’s villain, leader of a gang called the Bishop Boys, sports jet-black-dyed hair and a nearly twirlable matching mustache, while his cohort has sufficient face tattoos and scarification marks that I began thinking of them as the Bushwick Boys.
Whatever feminist angle the film might have once aspired to is lost in its listless shuffle. It’s probably no coincidence, then, that the viewer can’t tell whether the movie’s reluctance to serve up a rousing climax is the result of poor planning, or some kind of declaration of principles.
“Jane Got a Gun” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence and some language. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes.
