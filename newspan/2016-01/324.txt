China’s shrinking manufacturing sector and falling stock market have unnerved global investors. Any further doubt about its economic figures could paint an even darker picture of the health of the economy, adding to the pain in the markets. Stocks in Shanghai, which closed before the announcement, were off 6.4 percent on Tuesday.
At the official rate, China grew last year at the slowest pace in 25 years. The government is trying to manage a slowdown without letting the pain create social unrest.
The chief of China’s statistics bureau, Wang Baoan, linked the yuan depreciation with the strong dollar and downward pressure on the local economy, yet reiterated confidence in the stock market.
The disjointed attempts of policy makers to manage the stock markets and the currency are adding to skepticism about the economy.
