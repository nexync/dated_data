A new ad from the Cruz campaign running in South Carolina.
A red and gray image of a sullen President Obama interrupts the marches; the narrator accuses him of “decimating our military, threatening 3,000 jobs at Fort Jackson.” Mr. Cruz is seen speaking to a packed arena as the narrator promises that the senator will protect jobs at the fort. “Rebuild the military, kill the terrorists,” the narrator says in closing.
The ad, in its focus on a local concern, might feel as if it belongs in a congressional election. But it reinforces the macro, national message central to the Cruz campaign: an aggressive and confrontational response to terrorism, which includes investing more in the military.
Fort Jackson does indeed train “50 percent of the Army’s Basic Combat Training load and 60 percent of the women entering the Army each year,” according to the fort’s website. But cuts to the military were part of the budget sequestration approved by the Obama administration and Congress. The ad says that 3,000 jobs are threatened, but that was projected last year, and only 180 jobs were lost in the drawdown in May.
Mr. Cruz often talks about “rebuilding our military,” and it is included on his website’s issues page, but he has yet to detail how or what he would rebuild.
In the hypercompetitive, crowded Republican primary, it can be hard to break through and have an ad resonate. Rather than going outlandish or long, the Cruz campaign is banking on a hyperlocal issue to set this ad apart from the more general, nationwide messages voters have been seeing in debates and commercials.
