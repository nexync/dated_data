“My love for David Bowie goes back to ‘Hunky Dory,’ but it was during high school in Ohio, where I’d been dragged after a happy expatriate childhood, that he became my hero. ‘Young Americans,’ ‘Fame’ and ‘Golden Years’ were not just songs; to me they were missives from the outside world, and from the future. It’s probably not a coincidence that, after escaping to college, I fell in love with a boy who loved Bowie even more than I did: ‘ ‘Heroes’ ’ was the soundtrack of our first year together. Flash forward to 1999, when I took our son, then 15, to see Bowie at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles.
