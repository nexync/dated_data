Fey and Poehler, Jacobson and Glazer (“Broad City”), Parham and St. Clair (“Playing House”), Lindhome and Micucci (“Garfunkel and Oates”). Female comedy duos — steeped in some mix of improv troupes, cabaret, web series and “Saturday Night Live” before scoring their own television shows — are establishing a small but growing beachhead in prime time. On Thursday Comedy Central throws Jillian Bell and Charlotte Newhouse (formerly of the Groundlings) unto the breach with “Idiotsitter,” a sitcom expanded from a short-form online series.
Ms. Newhouse plays the sitter, Billie, a Harvard-educated noodge who can’t pay her student loans, and Ms. Bell (“Workaholics,” “22 Jump Street”) plays the idiot, Gene, the grown but disturbingly childlike daughter of wealthy parents. Answering an ad seeking a babysitter for a 7-year-old, Billie discovers she’s been duped: Gene is of age, outfitted with an ankle monitor and in need of an adult guardian during her house arrest. One sufficiently large check later, Billie is a paid companion, and Gene’s parents have decamped for a breathing workshop in France.
