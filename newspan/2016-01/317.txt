The Guardian said on Monday that it intended to cut its costs sharply in an effort to reduce its losses and break even at an operating level in three years’ time.
The Guardian’s editor, Katharine Viner, and the chief executive of The Guardian Media Group, David Pemsel, outlined a three-year plan with the goal of reducing the news organization’s $380 million annualized costs by 20 percent.
The Guardian Media Group, which is supported by a trust worth more than a billion dollars, said in its annual report for 2015 that its operating losses had been 45.3 million pounds, or more than $64 million in current dollars. A recent report in The Financial Times suggested that the company would require a 9 percent annual return to sustain that kind of loss.
“Against the backdrop of a volatile market, we are taking immediate action to boost revenues and reduce our cost base in order to safeguard Guardian journalism in perpetuity,” Mr. Pemsel said in a statement.
The company said it aimed to double revenue from readers with an enhanced membership offer, better align its editorial and commercial operations, and improve its advertising offerings to better track market trends like branded content, video and data.
It will also continue to place its international focus on growth on the United States and Australia and create a data team to support both the company’s editorial offerings and its commercial enterprises.
The Guardian, a left-wing British broadsheet newspaper, aggressively expanded on the web in recent years, and sought to establish a presence in the United States and Australia. Those efforts met with journalistic success — in 2014, the newspaper shared the Pulitzer Prize for public service, its first, with The Washington Post for articles based on National Security Agency documents leaked by the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden.
But, as for most publishing companies, financial success has been harder to attain as traditional revenue streams, most notably print advertising, have declined.
The company did not disclose precise details of the plan, but said that an “implementation timetable and further details” would be communicated in the coming months. The Financial Times suggested that the plan would include job losses.
The company declined to comment on potential layoffs.
