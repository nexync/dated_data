A former police officer convicted of raping and sexually victimizing women while on his beat in a low-income Oklahoma City neighborhood was ordered Thursday to spend the rest of his life in prison. Jurors had recommended that the former officer, Daniel Holtzclaw, be sentenced to 263 years for preying on women in 2013 and 2014. Judge Timothy Henderson agreed and said Mr. Holtzclaw would serve the terms consecutively and denied his request for an appeal bond. His lawyer, Scott Adams, said he would appeal. “It is what it is,” Mr. Adams said. “It wasn’t a surprise.” Prosecutors said Mr. Holtzclaw, an Asian-American, targeted black women in neighborhoods east and north of the State Capitol. During the trial, 13 women testified against him, and several said Mr. Holtzclaw had stopped them, checked them for outstanding warrants or drug paraphernalia, and then forced himself on them. His lawyer described him as a model officer whose attempts to help the drug addicts and prostitutes he came in contact with were distorted.
