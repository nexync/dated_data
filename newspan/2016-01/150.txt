Luke Spiller knows that the Struts are headed for big things. Already, the U.K. rock outfit has played in front of 80,000 people in Paris as the opener for the Rolling Stones. More recently, “Could Have Been Me,” the hard-charging lead single from band’s debut album, “Everybody Wants” (out March 4 via Freesolo/Interscope Records), has racked up more than 7 million plays on Spotify and has become a regular on rock radio. And Spiller, the Struts’ charismatic singer, has garnered comparisons to everyone from Tim Curry to the late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury (to whom he bears an almost eerie resemblance.) But today, he’s worried about just one thing: getting his makeup right. “Does it look all right?” he asks, looking in the mirror.
When the Struts booked the Rolling Stones gig in 2014, it was Spiller’s mother who encouraged him to reach out to Zandra Rhodes, the English designer who outfitted both Mercury and the Queen guitarist Brian May, for help. Apprehensive but sensing the need for “something big,” Spiller sent an email expressing his admiration to Rhodes, who responded right away. “She said, ‘It’s really funny that you emailed, because it’s been years since I’ve actually worked with an artist.’” The pair spent an afternoon together in London, where Rhodes showed Spiller an original reference piece for the famous pleated white blouse she once made for Mercury. (Along with Mercury, Spiller’s “Mount Rushmore” of style icons includes Elvis Presley, T. Rex’s Marc Bolan and the recently deceased David Bowie.) In the end, she designed a pair of tops for Spiller, including a shimmering, cobalt blue frock with hand-painted gold accents that the singer uses to end his sets.
