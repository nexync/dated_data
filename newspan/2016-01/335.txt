Low levels of lead exposure usually have no obvious or immediate symptoms, which means it can go undetected. But over time, even low levels of lead in blood can have profound effects on the brain and nervous system. Lower intelligence, difficulty in paying attention and with fine motor skills, and lower academic achievement have all been connected to elevated lead levels. Some studies have also linked lead exposure to violent behavior, and higher crime rates that can span at least two generations.
The C.D.C. now uses a reference level of 5 micrograms per deciliter to identify children with blood lead levels that are elevated. Before 2012, children were considered to have a blood lead level “of concern” if a test result indicated 10 or more micrograms per deciliter. Experts now say that no amount of lead in the blood is safe, and that even low levels of exposure can harm cognitive function and have other adverse effects. The C.D.C. recommends chelation therapy when a child’s blood lead level exceeds 45 micrograms per deciliter.
