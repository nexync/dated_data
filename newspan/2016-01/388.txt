Soak. Wash. Rinse. Dry. No Tilt!
Laundry day at Sunshine Laundromat in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, has always been a little out of the ordinary. Droll portraits of dogs adorn the walls, and snack-size bags of potato chips are complimentary. More than 20 vintage pinball machines ding and ping. Lately, though, there have been some changes.
A recent renovation has divided (mostly, anyway) the pinball machines from the washers and dryers. Soundproofing has softened the noise somewhat. And a speakeasy door in the back, fashioned from the fronts of two vertically stacked dryers, now leads to a 1,000-square-foot arcade with 23 pinball machines, a photo booth and a coin-operated fortunetelling chimp, along with a wine and beer bar that is to open on New Year’s Eve.
Peter Rose, 42, and Michael Medovoy, 30, are the masterminds. Before they became business partners, they grew up as kindred spirits, captivated by coin-operated equipment. Both were delighted by parking meters and each had a working pay phone in his bedroom (gifts from their mothers). Mr. Rose, as a freshman at New York University, sneaked a pinball machine past a security guard into his dorm room. Mr. Medovoy somehow crammed three pinball machines into his dorm at Boston University.
Mr. Medovoy operates Upright Coffee, adjacent to Sunshine, and Upright Brew House, in the West Village. Mr. Rose is something of a Mr. Fixit, and he maintains a collection of 200 pinball machines, some in storage, others at friends’ bars. His first move at Sunshine, in 2011, was to replace a few washing machines with pinball machines.
Georgieanna Malanik, 45, whose granddaughter, Arianna Marie, was born on Thanksgiving, now does laundry there four days a week.
