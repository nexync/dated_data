Early in the morning on Aug. 12, 2015, a 68-year-old man named Barry turned up at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center in Springfield, Ore., confused and feverish.
The case was not a candidate for even a minor subplot on “House.” The admitting doctor stopped one of the patient’s medications and inserted an IV to deliver fluids, and by late the next morning, he had largely recovered.
Still, Dr. Rajeev Alexander, the hospitalist who took over his care, was determined to make an accurate diagnosis.
Dr. Alexander considers it proper technique to review each mundane detail with a patient. He is full of scorn for the eureka style of medical diagnosis depicted on television, and by his own admission, he reads a CT scan with the sophistication of a barber.
Eventually, Dr. Alexander would discard the more exotic theories that had crossed his mind — meningitis, or possibly a condition known as serotonin syndrome — and settle on a far simpler malady: dehydration, which aggravated a chronic kidney problem.
He was nonetheless unapologetic about the time he had invested.
Dr. Alexander’s method is at the center of an emotional debate in medicine, in which the imperative to increase efficiency in a high-cost health care system is often at odds with the deference traditionally accorded to doctors.
It’s a debate that came home to Sacred Heart in the spring of 2014, when the administration announced it would seek bids to outsource its 36 hospitalists, the hospital doctors who supervise patients’ care, to a management company that would become their employer.
The outsourcing of hospitalists became relatively common in the last decade, driven by a combination of factors. There is the obvious hunger for efficiency gains. But there is also growing pressure on hospitals to measure quality and keep people healthy after they are discharged. This can be a complicated data collection and management challenge that many hospitals, especially smaller ones, are not set up for and that some outsourcing companies excel in.
“They assure you of relief of some headaches,” said Dr. John Nelson, a past president of the Society of Hospital Medicine. He compared outsourcing doctor groups to a management company to hiring a lawn service. “You’re relieved of having to get the mower out. You’re not necessarily assured that you’re happier with your yard.” In recent years, according to the society, 25 to 30 percent of hospitalists have worked for multistate management companies, which also employ doctors in other disciplines, like anesthesiology and emergency medicine.
Some Sacred Heart hospitalists left for other jobs, and the rest formed a union, one of the first of its kind in the country.
To everyone’s surprise, Sacred Heart’s administration agreed to junk its outsourcing plan, but this retreat did not usher in a love fest. Instead, there has been a long, grinding negotiation with the administration over the proper role of the hospital doctor, which continues to this day.
Dr. Alexander and his colleagues say they are in favor of efficiency gains. It’s the particular way the hospital has interpreted this mandate that has left them feeling demoralized. If you talk to them for long enough, you get the distinct feeling it is not just their jobs that hang in the balance, but the loss of something much less tangible — the ability of doctors everywhere to exercise their professional judgment.
As recently as the mid-1990s, there was no one called a hospitalist. Most doctors would simply scramble from their offices to the hospital when they had to tend to patients there. But the discipline grew rapidly thereafter — to roughly 50,000 hospitalists nationwide in 2015 from about 11,000 in 2003, according to industry estimates.
Gradually, it became clear that it would make more sense for a subset of internists to be based at each hospital, where they would handle the care of all the patients on site. The other internists could end their periodic hospital visits altogether.
In 2012, Sacred Heart’s parent, PeaceHealth, a nonprofit health care system, installed an executive named John Hill to adapt its Oregon hospitals to the latest trends in health care. Mr. Hill, in an effort to rein in the budget and improve the efficiency of a hospital that administrators said was lagging in key respects, including how long the typical patient stayed, eventually concluded that the hospitalists at Sacred Heart should be outsourced.
The basic accounting problem for hospitalists is that they are not a profit center. That is, when they treat patients, the amount a hospital can bill Medicare and insurance companies is typically less than what the hospital must pay them. The opposite is true for other specialists, like surgeons.
So it was no surprise when, in the spring of 2014, one of Mr. Hill’s colleagues came before the hospitalists and confirmed that the company would request bids for outsourcing their group. Still, the room erupted in anger and despair. The doctors were convinced that working for a management company would mean seeing many more patients per shift, and they worried about losing their jobs if they resisted.
Amid the groaning, a relatively new member of the group named Dr. David Schwartz observed, “They can’t fire all of us — there are unions.” This was a bit of a stretch: While there are hospitals around the country whose doctors are unionized, there did not appear to be a union anywhere composed of a single group of specialists. But Dr. Schwartz, a barrel-chested man with close-cropped hair and a bushy beard who would not look out of place at a graduate English seminar, thought unionizing might be worth a try.
At the time, it was only one of several options the doctors considered. They talked of forming an independent hospitalists group, of forming an alliance with an outsourcing firm of their choosing. But the alternatives gradually fell away for a variety of practical reasons, and the doctors were growing increasingly bitter.
Several doctors could not find it within themselves to be amused and gave notice. Eventually, about a third of the 36 in the group left. The hospital replaced many of them with contractor doctors, called locums.
By the time the doctors decided to hold their union election, almost all of them had become, if not pro-union, then convinced they had no better options. In early October they voted overwhelmingly to form a union that they chose to affiliate with the American Federation of Teachers, which already represented nurses at Sacred Heart.
By March 2015, the PeaceHealth leadership, whatever its interest in efficiency gains, was apparently not pleased that one of its hospitals had a white-collar labor insurrection on its hands. The company announced that it would not outsource the hospitalists, a move it later said was always a possibility. Mr. Hill, who declined to comment, left in May.
But backing down on outsourcing did not mean the hospital had given up on getting more out of its doctors.
To work in a hospital today is to be constantly preoccupied with money, and one of the more grating features as far as the Sacred Heart hospitalists are concerned has been the administration’s celebration of “skin in the game.” That means creating financial incentives for doctors to hit performance targets — like lowering patient’s length of stay and doing well on patient satisfaction surveys. The phrase entered the Sacred Heart lexicon in 2014, but the underlying concept has spread throughout the profession in recent years.
The hospitalists also chafe at the way the administration has tried to centralize decisions they used to make for themselves. This might include hiring fellow doctors or the order in which they see patients on any day. They also complain of being loaded down with administrative tasks.
His personal rebellion is to linger over patients as long as he thinks it’s necessary, the hell with the performance metrics that nudge him to see more.
A few weeks after I got back from Oregon, I spoke by phone with Rand O’Leary, who was promoted to oversee PeaceHealth’s hospital services in the state last summer. He was genial and disarmingly sympathetic to the hospitalists’ concerns. He said his negotiators and the union had been “dialoguing around” a compensation model that would award doctors a bonus for hitting certain performance targets — the dreaded “skin in the game.” The targets would include how many patients they see, but would also include measures of patient health and satisfaction.
Mr. O’Leary was especially proud of a ritual known as REAL rounds, which stands for “rounding embraced by all leaders,” in which administrators circulate through a different unit of the hospital each week and talk to doctors, nurses and other caregivers about their needs.
If Dr. Alexander’s medical experience has instilled a kind of fatalism, Dr. Schwartz’s has made him skeptical about human nature. During a morning of rounds, I couldn’t help noticing he was constantly on alert for ways that a patient’s version of events might not track.
This is not just true of patients. Noting that the negotiations with the hospital administration have dragged on for roughly a year, Dr. Schwartz said, “It’s pretty obvious that they don’t want to get a contract done.” He says the administration worries that if it essentially rewards the hospitalists with a contract, it encourages other hospital workers to unionize too.
Dr. Schwartz said he and his colleagues have always wanted to talk about staffing — ideally, they wanted to agree on a minimum proportion of doctors to patients — and how this affected patient safety. But when they raised these issues in the past, he said, the administration frequently shut down or retreated to marginal details.
Even starker than the divide over these questions are the differences in worldview represented on opposite sides of the table. During a bargaining session last fall, the administration proposed increasing the number of shifts a year. Hospitalists now earn about $223,000 a year for 173 shifts and are paid extra for working more. The hospital offered $260,000 for a mandatory 182 shifts, and up to $20,000 in bonus pay for hitting certain medical performance targets. The hospitalists work seven days on and seven days off, so this would have effectively eliminated any time off for sick days or vacation.
When the doctors pointed this out, the administration responded that if they missed a few days, it would make sure they got extra days to hit the required number of shifts for full pay.
One afternoon I had a drink with Dr. Alexander and Dr. Schwartz at a restaurant near the hospital. Dr. Schwartz was reacquainting himself with civilian life after working nine days straight, and both men were wearing untucked button-down shirts and looking much more relaxed than they had at work.
It didn’t take long, however, before they began to trade stories of outrage suffered at the hands of their hospital overlords. Both men were particularly exercised about the “REAL” rounds that the administration said gave it insight into how the hospital workers did their jobs.
The conversation turned, inevitably, to the dreaded “skin in the game.” I wanted to know what, exactly, they considered so offensive about having a financial stake in the hospital’s performance.
Dr. Schwartz responded by recounting the first time he had heard the expression, at a meeting with the hospital’s board of directors. A local businessman on the board had used the phrase while emphasizing the importance of providing the proper incentives for the doctors.
