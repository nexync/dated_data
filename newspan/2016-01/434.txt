In April 1941, my mother won an Arthur Murray participation dance contest at the Roosevelt Hotel. She was given a letter stating that the prize was a dinner ($2.50) at the Roosevelt Grill. She never collected her gift, but held on to the letter and left it to me when she died, in 1999.
My husband and I were in New York last month and stopped at the Roosevelt Hotel with the letter. We were greeted very enthusiastically by the concierge, the desk clerk and the general manager. The following night, we were treated to dinner at the Roosevelt Grill â€” cocktails, wine, Champagne, appetizer, entree and dessert. All of the staff served us most graciously and when we finished dining, we were presented with a bill for $5.00!
