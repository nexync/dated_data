Monsanto on Thursday stepped up its defense of Roundup, a widely used weed killer, by filing a lawsuit in California seeking to prevent glyphosate, the main ingredient in the herbicide, from being added to the state’s list of known carcinogens. The company said it filed the suit against the state’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and the agency’s acting director, Lauren Zeise, in California state court. The state agency said in September that it planned to add glyphosate to the list after the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classified it as a probable human carcinogen last March. Monsanto has disputed the assessment, citing numerous studies deeming glyphosate safe. In its lawsuit, Monsanto describes the International Agency for Research on Cancery as an “unelected, undemocratic, unaccountable and foreign body.” It says that the lack of oversight violates the company’s right to procedural due process under state and federal law. The agency did not comment, as it had not seen the suit. Roundup is used by farmers worldwide and generated $4.8 billion in revenue for Monsanto in the 2015 fiscal year. Questions about the safety of the herbicide have dogged Monsanto for years.
