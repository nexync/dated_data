Yates is as much an entrepreneur as he is a designer. Now 25 years old, he was a teenager when he set up his first company in 2008, producing jersey pieces for high-street retailers who sold them under their own labels. When it began to thrive, he dropped out of King’s College London, where he was studying French (“It was completely irrelevant,” he says, with a laugh). The success of his company allowed him to fund small art shows, at which he exhibited his own paintings and sculptures.
By 2013, he says, the company was “eating at my soul.” He began to think about a project with a closer relationship between creativity and business, and Bruta was born. It began with a small fall/winter 2015 offering of shirts and pots that was picked up by a handful of boutiques — including H Lorenzo in Los Angeles, Idea by Sosu in Tokyo and Celestine Eleven in London. Now follows the new spring collection: “This season is almost our real launch, where we actually considered it and took meetings, and all that kind of stuff,” he says. Yates tends to talk about his work as though it has happened almost by accident.
