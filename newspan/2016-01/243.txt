In 2011, she left Nordstrom after 14 years — though she didn’t rush into Schai. Instead, she took a two-year-long break from fashion (including shopping) to regroup mentally and travel. One day, she found herself in the Seattle Barneys outpost, touching a “buttery” 100-percent cashmere coat by Lanvin. “I had tears in my eyes, I had goosebumps all over my body, my heart was racing — it was such a visceral and emotional moment,” Chai says. “That was the reason I got back in. I said to myself, ‘I need to do something that’ll make me feel just as great and as attached to the product,’ and the customer who’s going to wear my clothes needs to experience the same attachment.” She sketched the entirety — and then some — of her debut collection in a single night, drawing 45 head-to-toe looks (easily 90 or 120 pieces, by her count) from 8:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m.; she edited the selection and decided to bring her Italian and Japanese fabrics to New York’s garment district (and to do some consulting on the side to pay for them). Salt, her inaugural offering for fall 2014, inspired by a magnified image of a salt crystal from her then-20-year-old son’s microscope, was picked up by three stores.
