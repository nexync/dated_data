Life could be complicated for Chinese aristocrats in the 1700s. Just ask the members of the Jia family, who populate “A Dream of Red Pavilions,” Pan Asian Repertory’s handsome and solemn new production at the Clurman Theater. They think everything is going to be fine when one of the daughters is chosen to be a royal courtesan. And they never even know that they have two immortal beings living with them, incarnated as family members.
The playwright, Jeremy Tiang, has to be commended for thinking big. Cao Xueqin’s “Dream of the Red Chamber,” the mid-18th-century novel his play is based on, was 80 chapters long in its shortest form, 120 in its longest, and included some 500 characters, with more than 40 of them considered major. Mr. Tiang pares it down to 18 (mostly Jia relatives and maids), played by a valiant cast of nine. No wonder the production feels so much like a study summary, with undeveloped subplots popping up like untended garden flowers and unelucidated motivations running rampant.
The central love story, on which Mr. Tiang wisely focuses, begins in the spirit world. A talking stone expresses a desire to experience the mortal world and human life. He is soon born to the Jia family as Baoyu (Vichet Chum). Before his transition, he meets and is charmed by a talking flower, who expresses the same wish. She is born as Daiyu (Kelsey Wang), a Jia cousin who comes to live with them. Baoyu and Daiyu are drawn to each other, but family members keep them apart. In fact, they trick Baoyu into marrying another cousin, with the help of the traditional opaque bridal veil.
Hyun Sook Kim’s period costumes evoke early Qing dynasty splendor. Sheryl Liu’s multipurpose set design is both simple and grand. The novel’s poetic style survives in the dialogue. But despite all those dream scenes and the efforts of two directors, Tisa Chang (the company’s artistic producing director) and Lu Yu, the production never becomes more than a pretty curiosity.
