From the Loewe ad campaign for fall 2016.
PARIS — Jonathan Anderson, a.k.a. J. W. Anderson, the reigning British designer of the year for both women’s wear and men’s wear, is one busy guy.
Last week, he showed his fall 2016 collection for men in London; next month, he will do the same for his women’s line. And this week he was in Paris, presenting his latest Loewe men’s wear collection, his fourth for the venerable Spanish luxury goods house.

This season’s collection continues earlier themes but is more exaggerated, with oversize bags, coats and leopard-print nutria beanies dominating the looks. There is also a mix of fabrics — denim and leather; fur and shearling; hand-painted leather jackets — as well as a simple, military-inspired look in his latest bag for Loewe, the Goya.
In talking about how he differentiates the work he does for Loewe from that for his own label, Mr. Anderson said one crucial distinction is that the Loewe collection is being shown as the advertising campaign is introduced, and that the clothes themselves are in stores — a luxury that Loewe affords him because, he noted, it has a network of 170 retail stores worldwide.
