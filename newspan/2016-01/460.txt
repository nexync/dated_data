Only 22 cases of Guinea worm disease were reported in 2015, the Carter Center announced last week, a significant drop from the 126 cases reported in 2014.
Equally unfortunate, Guinea worms have been found in hundreds of dogs in Chad, raising the danger that they have found a new host. The dogs live in riverbank fishing villages and appear to pick up the worms in offal thrown to them when fish are cleaned.
The Carter Center, in Atlanta, has led the fight to eliminate Guinea worm since former President Jimmy Carter made it his mission in 1986.  But in December, he said treatment had made his tumors disappear.
