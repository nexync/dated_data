Panic and confusion erupted in Central Park on Saturday night after a loud noise frightened concertgoers at the Global Citizen Festival, with some people erroneously attributing the sound to gunshots.
Witnesses described a near-stampede in some places, as people sprinted for cover, jumped fences and trampled one another. Some were in tears and called their loved ones, and others said they had lost items or gotten separated from their friends, according to social media reports.
But the police quickly refuted reports of a shooting, saying at first that the noise was from a fallen barrier, not gunshots. In a message posted on Sunday, the chief executive of Global Citizen said the police have since determined that the noise was caused by at least one attendee stepping on and “popping” at least one drink bottle. A New York police sergeant confirmed that to be the cause.
In the message, the chief executive, Hugh Evans, said a few dozen people reported injuries and sought treatment.
For many, the brief panic, which happened around 7:30 p.m., was an indication of the country’s mind-set at a time when mass shootings can happen anywhere — at schools, churches, nightclubs and concerts. Though there were no shots fired, the possibility of a shooting felt raw and real.
Global Citizen is a movement of citizens who want to use their voices to end extreme poverty by 2030. Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe were among those who were expected to perform on the park’s Great Lawn.
The concert appeared to stop briefly amid the chaos. Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, tried to calm the crowd before handing the microphone to Kathleen O’Reilly, an assistant chief with the Police Department.
The show was back on, and Janet Jackson took the stage.
