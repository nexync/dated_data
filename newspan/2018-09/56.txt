The Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law defends its actions at American colleges.
“U.S. Revives Rutgers Bias Case in New Tack on Anti-Semitism” (front page, Sept. 12) asserted that our organization, the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law, presses campuses to “squelch anti-Israel speech and activities” and urges “colleges and universities to discipline students who are part of the B.D.S. movement” (Boycott, Divest, Sanctions). Nothing could be further from the truth.
The Brandeis Center is a staunch supporter of freedom of speech. A main part of our mission is defending Jewish and pro-Israel students’ First Amendment rights from being trampled by anti-Israel protesters, a growing threat on college campuses.
In addition, we recently testified before the United States Commission on Civil Rights, calling for greater protections from rising bullying, including suppression of speech, against Jewish, Sikh and Muslim students at universities and in K-12 public schools. And we have never urged universities to discipline B.D.S.-supporting students or groups for their views.
But we take our mission of protecting civil rights seriously, and we will not tolerate behavior meant to intimidate, threaten or physically assault Jewish students, or any students, on campus.
When anti-Semitic speech is paired with unlawful action, the Brandeis Center will advocate — and advocate strongly — for the university to address the situation and assist victimized students.
