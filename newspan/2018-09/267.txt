LONDON — Doctors have long been chided for their seemingly unintelligible handwriting. Now, they are being urged to drop the Latin.
In an effort to improve written communication with patients, an initiative unveiled this week by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges — which represents 250,000 doctors in Britain — is encouraging doctors to ditch confusing medical jargon and instead write to their patients directly in plain, simple English.
The project says with more than five million outpatient visits a month in England, outpatient clinic letters are “the most written letters” in Britain’s National Health Service.
Currently, the letters are sent to the patient’s general practitioner instead of the patient, meaning that doctors have to write about their patients instead of writing to them, which can cause barriers in communication.
Dr. Hugh Rayner, a kidney specialist who is leading the initiative, said that while the change might seem small, it had already had an effect in the pilot phase of the project.
In its push for profits, the U.S. health care system has made it difficult for patients to get personal attention from doctors. But what if hands-on medicine actually saves money — and lives?
The guidance also applies when prescribing medicine: Doctors have been asked to use English such as “twice daily” instead of the Latin abbreviation “B.D.” (bis in die).
Beyond that, when including test results, the academy says, their significance should be explained and upsetting or unexpected results should be communicated by phone instead of by letter.
Lauren Cohen, a dental hygienist in east London, recalled receiving results for a medical condition by letter, but when she tried to call her doctor for an explanation, his assistant said he was unavailable for two days.
