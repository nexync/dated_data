ACE VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE (1994) 7 p.m. on Freeform. After a couple years spent mostly on hiatus, Jim Carrey returned this month in Showtime’s “Kidding.” Those wanting to revisit this funnyman’s genesis can watch him here in one of his most beloved roles, as a private investigator with a love of creatures and sarcasm. The film, combined with “The Mask” and “Dumb and Dumber,” made 1994 a year when comedies starring Mr. Carrey grossed over $700 million. The sequel, ACE VENTURA: WHEN NATURE CALLS (1995), is on Freeform directly after, at 9 p.m., and BRUCE ALMIGHTY (2003), starring a literally divine Mr. Carrey, is directly before, at 5 p.m.
