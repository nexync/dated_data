The San Jose Sharks acquired the two-time Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Erik Karlsson from the Ottawa Senators on Thursday, making a blockbuster addition to the roster after missing out on the high-scoring center John Tavares in free agency.
General Manager Doug Wilson stood pat for most of the summer after Tavares signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs before pouncing when another superstar was available the day before San Jose opened training camp. Karlsson joins one of the top defensive groups in the league alongside the 2017 Norris Trophy winner Brent Burns and the shutdown defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic.
San Jose is sending the Senators a first-round pick in 2019 or 2020, a second-round pick in 2019, forwards Chris Tierney, Josh Norris and Rudolfs Balcers, defenseman Dylan DeMelo and two conditional draft picks. The Sharks also get forward Francis Perron.
Ottawa will get a second-round pick in 2021 if Karlsson re-signs with the Sharks. That pick becomes a first if the Sharks make the Stanley Cup finals in 2019. The Senators also will receive a first-rounder in 2021 or 2022 if Karlsson is on an Eastern Conference roster this season.
Karlsson, 28, has one year left on his contract and has been the subject of rumors dating to the trade deadline last season.
In Karlsson, whose 518 points are by far the most of any defenseman since he entered the N.H.L. in 2009, San Jose gets the difference-maker it was hoping for when it pursued Tavares in free agency. Karlsson won the Norris as the league’s best defenseman in 2012 and 2015.
Karlsson had nine goals and 53 assists last season for Ottawa. He also led the team in average ice time (26 minutes 44 seconds, third in the N.H.L.), was second in blocked shots (120) and takeaways (55) and second in scoring with 62 points (nine goals, 53 assists).
Karlsson also has six goals and 31 assists in 48 career playoff games.
It’s just the latest big trade made by Wilson, who has also acquired Burns, Joe Thornton and Evander Kane in trades over the years.
The Sharks made the addition without giving up a top-six forward or top-four defenseman. Tierney, 24, played the biggest role for San Jose of any of the players traded to Ottawa, spending much of the year as a third-line center. He had career highs with 17 goals and 23 assists and played all 82 games. He has 41 goals and 63 assists in 284 career games.
DeMelo played mostly on San Jose’s third defensive pair last season, when he had no goals and 20 assists in 63 games.
Balcers spent last season in the American Hockey League, and Norris was a first-round pick in 2017 and is entering his sophomore season at Michigan.
Perron was a seventh-round pick in 2014 and spent the past two seasons in the A.H.L.
