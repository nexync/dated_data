You’ve probably heard that Donald Trump has been comparing himself to Abraham Lincoln.
The president has certainly been having an, um, tough week. He’s reeling from the combination of Bob Woodward’s new book and the Times Op-Ed in which an anonymous senior official assured the country that the people behind the scenes are working very, very hard to make sure Trump isn’t actually running the country — which would of course be disastrous.
On Friday, Trump said he thought the attorney general should ferret out the author, as a matter of “national security.” People, how do you think Jeff Sessions responded when he heard that? Perhaps with a bitter laugh, recalling that the Woodward book has Trump calling his attorney general “retarded”?
Nononono. If we start going back over all the things we knew before Donald Trump was elected president, we will all fall into a deep depression. Pick yourself up. It’s almost autumn, and remember, Donald Trump is having a worse week than you are.
About the anonymous official’s Op-Ed: Trump has of course been trying to prove it’s all terribly wrong. For instance, the author had bemoaned the fact that “in public and in private,” the president “shows a preference for autocrats and dictators” like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un.
Trump responded with a tweet. What do you think he said?
Hmmm. Willing to let pass the idea that it was our ancestors who went to the moon. But where did the movie come from? Trump had lurched into a mini-tangent about the fact that “First Man,” a soon-to-be-released film about the astronaut Neil Armstrong, does not include a scene showing the flag being put on the moon.
Who do you think is worse, Elon Musk or Donald Trump? Well, Trump doesn’t drink or do drugs. On the other hand, Elon Musk does not have access to nuclear weapons.
