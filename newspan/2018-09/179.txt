BOSTON — Responding to reports of sexual abuse and misconduct over a matter of decades, the state of New Hampshire on Thursday opted not to prosecute former employees of St. Paul’s School, one of the most prestigious prep schools in New England, and instead assigned an independent monitor to the campus for up to five years.
Several analysts called the agreement groundbreaking because it places a private school under government oversight and said it could serve as a model for other states on the issue of school sexual abuse.
Mr. MacDonald had announced in July 2017 that he was starting a criminal investigation into reports of sexual abuse committed by teachers decades ago and stories about a sexual ritual among some students that figured in the rape trial of a former student in 2015. The attorney general and a grand jury received thousands of pages of documents and heard testimony from two dozen witnesses.
A lawyer for students who have reported abuse at St. Paul’s and other prep schools said the decision not to pursue criminal charges made sense because more students can benefit from oversight going forward.
“This is really unprecedented,” said Eric MacLeish, the lawyer.
He added that the agreement could lead to a national discussion of whether private schools should be licensed on a regular basis by state child protection agencies.
The person assigned to monitor St. Paul’s will have office space on the Concord campus, as well as access to school records and the ability to interview students and personnel. The school is to pay for the so-called compliance overseer and to provide space for a victim advocate, who will also be available to students through a crisis hotline.
She said that what schools have been doing until now “clearly has not worked” and that the settlement provides a road map for schools that are committed to providing a safe learning environment.
