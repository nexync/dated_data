The law professor testified against Judge Clarence Thomas during his confirmation hearings in 1991. What has changed since?
Twenty-seven years ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Anita F. Hill, a law professor, and Judge Clarence Thomas, the Supreme Court nominee she accused of sexual harassment. We look at how those events are shaping the confirmation hearings for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh.
Kate Zernike, who covers politics for The New York Times.
In 1991, senators questioned Anita Hill about her accusation that Clarence Thomas, a nominee to the Supreme Court, had sexually harassed her. The questions and remarks that lawmakers made during the hearings are now viewed as a low point for the Senate.
 Here are five key moments from those hearings.
Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused him of sexual assault, are expected to testify on Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The Republicans on the committee, who are all male, have hired an outside counsel to aid in questioning Dr. Blasey at the hearing.
