For two years, Americans have learned details of Russia’s intervention in the 2016 election: hacked and leaked emails, widespread fraud on social media, overtures from people suspected of being Kremlin spies, and allegations of conspiracy.
This morning, The Times published a special report with a full timeline exploring what has been learned, and what it all means. Read it here.
Christine Blasey Ford is resisting appearing before lawmakers on Monday to testify about her accusation that the Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.
Senate Republicans have rejected her request for an F.B.I. investigation, and said that Monday is her one chance to be heard.
The standoff seemed to draw wavering Republican senators back into Judge Kavanaugh’s camp on Wednesday, and a committee meeting has been scheduled for next Wednesday for a possible vote to move his nomination to the Senate floor.
Before boarding Marine One for a visit to North Carolina, President Trump again defended Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford, a university professor.
They’re hurting somebody’s life very badly. And it’s very unfair, I think to — as you know, Justice Kavanaugh has been treated very, very tough, and his family — I think it’s a very unfair thing what’s going on. So, we’ll see. But I do think this: They’ve given it a lot of time. They will continue to give it a lot of time, and really it’s up to the Senate. I’d really want to see her. I really would want to see what she has to say. I think he’s an extraordinary man. I think he’s a man of great intellect, as I’ve been telling you. And he has an unblemished record. If she shows up, that would be wonderful. If she doesn’t show up, that would be unfortunate. Well, the F.B.I. has been very involved with respect to Justice Kavanaugh — they know Justice Kavanaugh very well. They’ve investigated him, I guess, six times and they’ve investigated him for this hearing. Look, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and we’ll have to make a decision. But I can only say this: He is such an outstanding man — very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.

In private letters, Benedict XVI, the pope emeritus, has said that the “anger” expressed by his supporters risks tarnishing his legacy.
In 2013, Benedict became the first pope in almost 600 years to resign, and some of his conservative supporters have privately expressed frustration with him for allowing the election of Francis, who they think is ruining the church.

The typhoon that battered parts of Asia in the past week is named Mangkhut. What does the name mean, and why did the Philippines call the storm Ompong instead?
“Words can no more describe how mangosteens taste than explain why I love my wife and children,” he wrote in 2003.
The mangosteen, which has a hard shell and white flesh inside, is cheap and plentiful in Asia but rarer and more expensive in the West, where it is nonetheless growing in popularity.
The task of naming typhoons falls to the Japan Meteorological Agency, which uses names from a list suggested by different countries. But when typhoons enter the Philippine “area of responsibility” for monitoring storms, they are assigned different names by the national meteorological agency there, which has issued its own list each year since it was established in 1972. Thus, Mangkhut became Ompong in the Philippines.
Local names, the country’s agency reasons, are easier for residents to remember and make the storms feel more immediate, increasing the chance that people will take them seriously.
