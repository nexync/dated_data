British investigators used security footage and flight records to track two Russian men who now stand accused of attempted murder in the March attack featuring the nerve agent Novichok.
Two Russians have been accused of an assassination attempt using a nerve agent called Novichok. The target was Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy living in Britain. He’s filmed here in a local shop, days before he was targeted. He and his daughter Yulia fell seriously ill from exposure to Novichok, but survived. Security footage allowed police to track the two suspected hit men as they entered Britain and scoped out their target over two days. March 2: They fly from Moscow to London’s Gatwick Airport. They check into a hotel in East London. March 3: They take public transport to Salisbury where Mr. Skripal lived. They stake out their target for several hours. March 4: They return to Salisbury by train. Minutes later, a camera films them walking past this gas station just a short walk to Mr. Skripal’s home. This was moments before their attack, police say. They’re transporting the nerve agent in a perfume bottle. It’s then sprayed on the front door handle of Mr. Skripal’s house. Soon after, the men are seen returning to Salisbury train station. They’re last seen that evening at Heathrow Airport. At 10:30 p.m. they leave London for Moscow. By then, Mr. Skripal and his daughter had been found unresponsive on a park bench. They were hospitalized and eventually recovered. Months later, two Salisbury residents found the discarded perfume bottle and were also hospitalized. Dawn Sturgess died from exposure and her partner, Charlie Rowley, became seriously ill. Police believe the two hit men traveled under aliases and have asked Russia for help identifying them.
