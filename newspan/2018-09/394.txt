In books, TV series and documentaries, stand-up comics of the 1970s have become nearly as mythologized as the auteurs of the New Hollywood. If Richard Pryor, David Letterman and Andy Kaufman were the Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola of the club scene, then Elayne Boosler is the Hal Ashby, the misunderstood master who never got proper due.
This makes the release of her new box set “Timeless,” which includes four of her old specials along with one new album, a prime opportunity to reassess her role in the comedy canon.
She also developed a reputation in the industry for being difficult, and untangling this from the sexism can be hard. Yet the narrative surrounding her — of a career thwarted — can be overstated, when the stand-up special has become such an important genre. Make no mistake: Ms. Boosler was its first female star, regularly putting out hours of jokes on cable in the 1980s and early ’90s that represented a break from the past. Unlike the acts of Joan Rivers and Phyllis Diller, there was not a whiff of the borscht belt or the coffeehouse about her material. Her act — hard-hitting, topical and dense with punch lines — anticipated the future of comedy better than most if not all of her peers.
After her last joke, Paul Shaffer played the J. Geils Band song “Centerfold” and Ms. Boosler curtsied.
