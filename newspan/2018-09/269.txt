LONDON — The Cranberries lead singer, Dolores O’Riordan, died from drowning after heavy drinking, a coroner in London ruled on Thursday.
Ms. O’Riordan was found in a bathtub in a room of the London Hilton hotel around 9 a.m. on Jan. 15. There was no evidence of self-harm or other injuries, but her blood alcohol level was more than four times the legal limit for driving in Britain, the court heard.
The singer’s death was an accident, the coroner, Shirley Radcliffe, ruled at the hearing, which was held on what would have been Ms. O’Riordan’s 47th birthday.
Other members of the Cranberries posted a statement on Twitter after the ruling. “To see how much of a positive impact she had on people’s lives has been a source of great comfort to us,” it read.
The band is continuing “to struggle to come to terms with what happened,” the statement added, before asking for privacy.
The court heard that Ms. O’Riordan had bipolar disorder, but had responded well to treatment, the BBC reported. A psychiatrist told the court that he had spoken with the singer just days before her death and that she had been in good spirits, according to the BBC.
The Cranberries achieved widespread popularity principally in the 1990s thanks to hits including “Linger,” which remained on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart for 24 weeks, and “Dreams.” Ms. O’Riordan wrote lyrics and often the music for many of them, and she was the sole writer of “Zombie,” an impassioned response to an Irish Republican Army terrorist bombing in 1993.
