As you follow Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Senate confirmation hearings, here are three books that explore the inner workings of the Supreme Court, including one that asks: Are the nine justices too powerful?
It takes “an enterprising and intelligent outsider” like Toobin, who doesn’t cover the Supreme Court exclusively, to produce a book as “engaging, erudite, candid and accessible” as “The Nine,” wrote our reviewer. Toobin captures the court at a moment of transition, opening with the nine judges lined up on the steps of the court for a farewell ceremony for Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Drawing on rare exclusive interviews with the justices, he then drafts vivid portraits of them and of the court dynamics.
The court is currently in another moment of transition, and in his new book, Kaplan argues that the institution is no longer serving the function of operating above bipartisanship. From Roe v. Wade to Bush v. Gore to Citizens United, the justices have weighed in on our most challenging social and political battles, but according to Kaplan, their role should be like that of “an umpire who merely calls balls and strikes,” not of a central player. In this recently released book, he explains why their oversized power threatens our democracy.
Sandra Day O’Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg couldn’t be more different on paper: Ginsburg is a Jewish liberal from Brooklyn, while O’Connor is a Christian conservative from Texas. But in this joint biography of the first two women to sit on the Supreme Court, Hirshman shows how they complemented each other. “O’Connor had made it easier,” for her successor, Hirshman writes, because she displayed “laser judgment about what the court — and the society — would digest at any particular moment,” always framing her “mildly pro-woman” decisions as protective of the status quo. O’Connor was the “perfect first” to precede Ginsburg, Hirshman argues.
