In a mostly ho-hum night at the Emmys, Glenn Weiss delivered a moment that left most of those in attendance slack-jawed and applauding.
He proposed to his girlfriend, Jan Svendsen, on live television after winning an Emmy.
Mr. Weiss, who has now amassed more than a dozen Emmys, won for outstanding directing for a variety special for his work on the most recent Oscars. He’s a veteran of Hollywood-centric television events, having helmed events as varied as the Kennedy Center Honors and the Macy’s 4th of July Spectacular.
He started his speech paying tribute to his mother, whom he said had passed away two weeks ago.
He got on one knee and said, “Jan, I want to put this ring that my mom wore on your finger in front of all these people and in front of my mom and your parents watching from above. Will you marry me?"
She, of course, said yes, and the two walked offstage with an Emmy and a lifetime partnership.
Speaking to reporters after the show, Mr. Weiss said the couple met in 2001 while working together, and that they had been together for 10 years. He said he did not tell anyone about his proposal plans except his father, since he was the keeper of his mother’s ring.
“Now it’s where it belongs,” Mr. Weiss said.
Emmys producers, like the viewers, were in the dark. Mr. Weiss said he considered warning them, but the director of the show, Hamish Hamilton, was nominated in the same category so it would have been a bit awkward, he said.
Ms. Svendsen, who was the chief marketing officer for the Tony Awards, said they were used to attending a lot of awards shows, so she was not expecting anything unusual — certainly not a proposal.
