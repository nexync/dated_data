Senator Jeff Flake initially announced his support for Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, leading to protests in the Capitol over the sexual assault accusations against the judge. Mr. Flake later proposed a shift in course.
The scene was striking: Two women blocking an elevator door, angrily demanding to be heard as a senator stood by, listening quietly, nodding and looking away.
Mr. Flake had just announced his intention on Friday morning to vote to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, despite emotional testimony a day earlier from Christine Blasey Ford, who had accused Judge Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Reporters swarmed around as Mr. Flake waited in the elevator, but the two women interrupted and demanded that he listen.
“I need to go, I need to go to the hearing,” Mr. Flake told Ms. Archila, 39, in the widely shared video of the moment.
Hours later, in a surprise development, Senator Flake said that he would not support confirmation without a one-week F.B.I. investigation into the allegations, as he joined his fellow Republicans in advancing the nomination. There was widespread speculation that the elevator encounter had played a role.
Ms. Archila, a national committee member of the Working Families Party and an executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, a New York-based liberal organizing group, said the moment had come together in a flash of righteous rage. She had spent the week in Washington protesting Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination, she said, and had just read about Mr. Flake’s decision when she saw him in a Capitol Hill hallway.
Ms. Archila and Maria Gallagher, 23, who had also come to protest the confirmation, raced to block the elevators Mr. Flake was heading toward, she said, and confronted him as he entered.
“I wanted him to feel my rage,” Ms. Archila said in an interview on Friday afternoon.
As she spoke to him, Mr. Flake nodded and looked down, his eyes darting between her, the floor and the elevator wall — a moment captured live on CNN.
Then Ms. Gallagher spoke.
Later, as she tearfully reprimanded Mr. Flake for his decision to support Judge Kavanaugh, Ms. Gallagher demanded the senator’s attention.
Ms. Gallagher declined to be interviewed, but confirmed many details through a spokesman.
Ms. Archila said that when they confronted Mr. Flake, it was one of the first times either had publicly shared their accounts of sexual assault. Ms. Archila, who says she was assaulted when she was 5, said she was moved to tell her story after seeing Dr. Blasey’s testimony.
Mr. Flake was in a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday afternoon after the exchange and could not be immediately reached for comment. In the video, he can be seen bowing his head as the women tell their stories, and murmuring, “Thank you,” without answering their questions.
The exchange channeled anger among liberals over how Republicans have run the confirmation. Shortly after the women confronted Mr. Flake, several Democrats walked out of the committee’s hearing.
“This is just a total railroad job,” yelled Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, before walking out of the room.
For each woman, the encounter meant that her family now knew about an assault that was once private, given how widely video footage of the exchange had been shared.
Ms. Archila said that her father messaged her after finding out: “I’m so sorry for not being able to protect you,” he said.
Following is a full transcript of the conversation between Mr. Flake, Ms. Archila and Ms. Gallagher, as prepared by The New York Times.
  I told it because I recognized in Dr. Ford’s story that she is telling the truth. What you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court. This is not tolerable. You have children in your family. Think about them. I have two children.
I cannot imagine that for the next 50 years they will have to have someone in the Supreme Court who has been accused of violating a young girl. What are you doing, sir?
ANOTHER PROTESTER: I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me. I didn’t tell anyone, and you’re telling all women that they don’t matter, that they should just stay quiet because if they tell you what happened to them you are going to ignore them. That’s what happened to me, and that’s what you are telling all women in America, that they don’t matter. They should just keep it to themselves because if they have told the truth, you’re just going to help that man to power anyway.
That’s what you’re telling all of these women. That’s what you’re telling me right now.  You are telling me that my assault doesn’t matter, that what happened to me doesn’t, and that you’re going to let people who do these things into power. That’s what you’re telling me when you vote for him. Don’t look away from me.
Look at me and tell me that it doesn’t matter what happened to me, that you will let people like that go into the highest court of the land and tell everyone what they can do to their bodies.
