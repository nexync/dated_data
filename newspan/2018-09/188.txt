In a pair of tweets casting doubt on the official estimate of nearly 3,000 deaths, the president clung to an outdated estimate, wrongly suggested that doubt over the figure emerged “a long time later” and inaccurately characterized the new figure as including all deaths on the island.
President Trump rejected the official estimate from the Puerto Rico government that nearly 3,000 people died from Hurricane Maria through a series of misleading or false claims on Thursday.
He cited an outdated tally that officials had acknowledged almost immediately was too low, misleadingly suggested that doubt over the tally did not emerge until “a long time later,” accused Democrats, without evidence, of inflating the figures and wrongly described the current official estimate as counting all deaths on the island, regardless of whether they were related to the storm.
The 3,000 figure comes from an estimate in a study by independent researchers at George Washington University and commissioned by the Puerto Rico government.
Hours after the study was released in late August, the government of Puerto Rico revised its estimated death toll to 2,975 people.
Even if Mr. Trump has expressed doubts, at least five other independent analyses — using a number of methodologies and examining varying amounts of time elapsed since the hurricane made landfall — pin the toll around 1,000 or more, magnitudes larger than the six to 18 deaths he cited.
That figure appears to refer to Puerto Rico’s initial estimate of the toll at 16, which was released several days after the storm made landfall on the island on Sept. 20, 2017. It was updated to 34 in early October 2017, a day after Mr. Trump visited the island. The estimate was again revised to 64 in December 2017, and Puerto Rico announced it would commission a recount that same month.
The “very large numbers” from independent analyses — not Democrats — began to emerge in fall and winter 2017, but the official estimates were met with widespread skepticism from news organizations and public health experts from the start. And even Puerto Rican officials have acknowledged that their tallies underestimated the number of deaths from Hurricane Maria since the initial count.
John Mutter, a professor at Columbia University and expert on disaster mortality, said he never bought into the official tally, given how difficult it is to evacuate from an island.
“No serious academic who studies this stuff thought that was plausible. It was implausibly small,” he said. In contrast, Mr. Mutter said, the George Washington University estimate and others like it produced much more believable counts.

Nov. 21, 2017: Alexis R. Santos, a researcher at Pennsylvania State University, and an independent demographer estimated that 518 more people died in Puerto Rico in September than the expected level based on historical patterns of death.
Dec. 7, 2017: The Center for Investigative Journalism reported that at least 985 people died in the 40 days after Hurricane Maria, using methodology similar to Mr. Santos’s paper.

Feb. 28, 2018: Mr. Santos updated his findings to 1,230 deaths from September to November.
May 29, 2018: Researchers from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, based on interviews with people in more than 3,000 households, estimated storm-related deaths could range from 800 to 8,000 people, with a midrange estimate of 4,600.
Aug. 9, 2018: The government of Puerto Rico admitted in a report requesting funding from Congress that 1,427 more people died from September to December 2017 than in previous years.
