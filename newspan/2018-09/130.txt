Until recently, the place you’d be most likely to encounter the name Anton Reicha was in the footnotes of books about Beethoven. The two met as teenagers when they played in the same orchestra in Bonn, Germany: Reicha as second flute, Beethoven on viola. Reicha’s name also pops up in the biographies of composers who studied counterpoint with him in Paris: Berlioz, Liszt, Franck, Gounod.
