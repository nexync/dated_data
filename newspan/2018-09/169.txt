The effects-heavy trailer puts more emphasis on Mr. Depp’s titular villain than a previous clip that debuted at July’s Comic-Con International did. It also provides peeks at a few characters not seen in the franchise’s previous installment, 2016’s “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” These include Newt’s older brother, the war veteran Theseus (Callum Turner), and Nagini (Claudia Kim), a circus performer who can transform into a snake and later becomes the pet of the dreaded Lord Voldemort.
“Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” will be released in theaters on Nov. 16.
