The two remaining divisional battles for first place could each come down to a tiebreaker game, keeping the wild-card matchup up in the air.
Three National League races will still be up for grabs entering the final day of the regular season. And the N.L. Central and N.L. West races, and thus the wild-card matchup, may even need an extra day, as two teams are tied for first place in each of those divisions.
The Chicago Cubs and the Milwaukee Brewers are tied for first place.
Miles Mikolas outpitched Cole Hamels as the visiting St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Cubs, 2-1, on Saturday. Milwaukee took advantage and tied the Cubs, defeating the visiting Detroit Tigers, 6-5, on the strength of two Christian Yelich home runs.
If the Cubs and the Brewers are tied after Sunday’s games, the Cubs will host a tiebreaker game on Monday to determine who wins the division and who hosts the wild-card game on Tuesday.
“It’s a special moment to be able to see that type of intensity that comes with meaningful games and that sort of playoff atmosphere,” Hamels said.
The Colorado Rockies and the Los Angeles Dodgers are tied for first place.
The Dodgers clinched their sixth straight postseason berth with a 10-6 victory at San Francisco. Joc Pederson led off the game with a home run for Los Angeles. The Rockies, which had won eight in a row, fell into a tie for first with a 12-2 home loss to Washington, which got a homer and four runs batted in from Juan Soto. Colorado will have to face the ace Max Scherzer (18-7, 300 strikeouts) on Sunday.
