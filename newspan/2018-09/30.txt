Henry Winkler Wins His First Emmy. Ayyy!
Henry Winkler deserved the biggest thumbs up of all on Monday night. More than 40 years after his first Emmy nomination, he finally took home a statuette.
“I wrote this 43 years ago,” he said. “Skip Brittenham said to me a long time ago: ‘If you stay at the table long enough, the chips come to you.’ And tonight, I got to clear the table.” Mr. Brittenham is an eminent entertainment lawyer.
In his acceptance speech, Mr. Winkler thanked the show’s creators Alec Berg and Bill Hader, who also stars in the show and won the best actor in a comedy Emmy.
