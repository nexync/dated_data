The L2, Leica’s new watch with a G.M.T. function, retails at slightly less than 15,000 euros.
Leica Camera, the German brand used by famed photographers like Diane Arbus, Henri Cartier-Bresson and Man Ray, plans to add a new category this fall to its array of meticulously made technical items: luxury watches.
“We’ve always been dealing with the mechanical construction of outstanding instruments,” said Jérôme Auzanneau, managing director of Ernst Leitz Werkstätten, a division of the company, and global director of Leica’s accessories. “There was no reason why we couldn’t try and extend the brand a bit further.
The collection, coming in November, will have two manually wound timepieces: the L1, a time-and-date model priced at 9,900 euros ($11,460) and the L2, with a G.M.T. function, at slightly less than €15,000. Both will be 41 millimeters in diameter and cased in stainless steel. The L2 will also be offered in rose gold.
The watches initially will be sold only at specially chosen Leica boutiques, including the ones in the Mayfair neighborhood of London and West Hollywood, Calif. Wider distribution through select watch retailers is planned for next year, as is an additional model, the L3.
The watches are being produced at Leica’s headquarters in Wetzlar, Germany, about an hour’s drive north of Frankfurt, using movements by Lehmann Präzision, which makes high-precision machinery as well as its own watches. “It’s a genuine, pure-German Leica product,” Mr. Auzanneau said.
