Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has abruptly changed the focus of an annual fund-raising campaign amid a widening crisis that has already led to the resignation of its chief medical officer and a sweeping re-examination of its policies.
The move follows an article Thursday by The New York Times and ProPublica about an exclusive deal that Memorial Sloan Kettering made with an artificial intelligence start-up to use digital images of 25 million tissue slides analyzed over decades. The company, Paige.AI, was founded by three hospital insiders, and also involved investors who were Memorial Sloan Kettering board members.
A development campaign focused on artificial intelligence will be changed to focus instead on patient care.
The change highlights the fund-raising challenges faced by Memorial Sloan Kettering, which is one of the nation’s most prestigious cancer centers and recently completed a $3.5 billion multiyear fund-raising drive. Earlier this month, the hospital’s chief medical officer, Dr. José Baselga, resigned under fire after an article by The Times and ProPublica revealed that he had failed to disclose his extensive industry ties in dozens of medical journal articles in recent years.
The fallout has led medical and academic experts to call for tighter disclosure rules on potential conflicts of interest in the cancer research fields and among major nonprofit organizations. Dr. Thompson and Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, acting physician-in-chief, acknowledged the issue of low morale in an email to the staff on Monday.
