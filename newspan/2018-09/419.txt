“Love After Love” arrives on Hulu. And Guillermo del Toro’s fantasy drama “The Shape of Water” is on HBO.
HOT SUMMER NIGHTS (2018) on Amazon, Google Play and YouTube. When Daniel (Timothée Chalamet) learns that his mother is sending him to Cape Cod to stay with his aunt after the death of his father, he responds: “Sending me away for the summer. What a cliché.” Sadly, clichés abound in this debut film by Elijah Bynum. Set in 1991, the movie opens like a coming-of-age tale but morphs into a half-baked thriller when Daniel teams up with the drug dealer and local tough guy Hunter (Alex Roe). He fishes for more danger by starting things up with Hunter’s estranged sister, McKayla (Maika Monroe), who warns Daniel to steer clear of her brother. Some scenes rise to the occasion, but Mr. Bynum makes his influences so clear that “Hot Summer Nights” could use fewer references and more originality.
THE SHAPE OF WATER 8 p.m. on HBO; also on Amazon, Google Play, HBO streaming platforms and YouTube. This drama by Guillermo del Toro, which won four Oscars, delicately traces the romance of Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a nighttime janitor at a government research lab in Cold War-era Baltimore, and a creature she discovers trapped in a tank (Doug Jones). A. O. Scott called the film “altogether wonderful” in his review for The Times.
VERSAILLES MARATHON 12 p.m. on Ovation. This salacious reimagining of Louis XIV’s reign returns for a third and final season on Oct. 6. Catch up on the series with this marathon of the first season, in which the Sun King (George Blagden) orders the construction of the Versailles Palace.
