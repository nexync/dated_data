We should all applaud the service and the sentiment of Joe Quinn, who had the courage to share his opinions about ending “the war.” Nobody is better qualified to promote this view than a combat veteran.
We spend a lot of time in America talking about the service of our soldiers, especially those who currently serve in combat zones. We also talk a lot about those who are killed or wounded in combat. The best dialogue that we could have as a country would be how to stop sending our men and women in harm’s way on what has proved to be a fool’s errand.
It would be great if our elected politicians spent more time arguing about whether the continuing resolutions authorizing military intervention overseas should be halted. Instead, it seems as if they are bent on increasing the defense budget and rattling sabers.
Afghanistan has often been called the country where “empires go to die.” Unfortunately, it is still a country where our troops are still dying, 17 years later.
