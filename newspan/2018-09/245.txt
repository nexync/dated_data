President Trump assailed the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh a day before the woman who has accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that the accusations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee, “are all false,” but also said that he “can always be convinced” after watching the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused the judge of attempted rape.
In a rambling and combative news conference during which he lashed out against Democratic senators, Mr. Trump said that his own opinion about Judge Kavanaugh’s case is affected by the many allegations of sexual misconduct that have been leveled against him by women in the past.
Speaking in New York, where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Trump repeatedly refused to give a direct answer to whether he thought the three women who have accused Judge Kavanaugh of misconduct are liars.
“They are going to have a big shot at speaking or making their case, and you know what, I could be persuaded,” the president said.
