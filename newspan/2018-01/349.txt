You oversee podcasts, virtual reality and other new digital efforts. What does a typical day look like for your media consumption?
I read several email newsletters, then I read The Times’s front page in print, flip to the Opinion pages and scan for other articles to read on my phone during the commute.
You study new opportunities for The Times to distribute its journalism. How do you decide which ventures are worth pursuing?
What are some of your favorite new publishing strategies that you see The Times or other outlets experimenting with?
I know some people find push alerts to be intrusive, but I’m fascinated by them. I watch N.B.A. highlights right from my phone’s lock screen: The great Bleacher Report app sends out push alerts with embedded videos of the key moments from the games, often in real time. I never even open the app, but it has totally changed how I watch basketball.
