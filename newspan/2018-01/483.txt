She described the incident to the director and editor of her film at the time, the complaint says. It interrupted her work and led her to feel humiliation, fear and depression, for which she needed medication, the complaint says, in the request for damages.
Perry C. Wander, a lawyer for Ms. Jarosik, said in a telephone interview Thursday that Ms. Jarosik also alleges that Mr. Simmons assaulted her in his home in New York in 2011, and that she intends to file a criminal complaint with the New York Police Department, which has been investigating several sexual misconduct complaints by other women against Mr. Simmons, as well as the Los Angeles police.
Mr. Wander said that, until other women began describing their experiences with Mr. Simmons, Ms. Jarosik felt guilty about her encounters. “She was blaming herself,” he said.
