For some time, scientists have suspected that the body’s internal organs are as gossipy and socially entangled as any 8th-grade classroom. It is thought that, under the right conditions, fat cells chat with muscle cells, and muscle cells whisper to brain cells and everybody seems to want to be buddies with the liver.
The researchers next used sophisticated new sampling techniques to quantify the proteins and vesicles in the men’s blood.
The majority of these proteins were already known to be important for metabolism and the body’s ability to regulate energy. But they had not previously been found in people’s bloodstreams during exercise.
It wasn’t clear from this sampling, though, where these vesicles and their proteins went within the body and what happened when they arrived.
Most of the vesicles from the runners made a beeline for the animals’ livers, the scientists found, directed by biological signals that were not obvious but insistent.
When the scientists next added vesicles from the blood of the running mice directly into liver cells isolated from other mice, they watched as the vesicles’ exterior walls dissolved and their protein payload became absorbed into the liver cell, its biochemical message effectively delivered.
“This study reveals a huge amount of complexity in the circulating blood during exercise that we might have previously underestimated,” says Martin Whitham, a biologist at the Garvan Institute who, with his fellow Garvan researcher Mark Febbraio, led the new study.
