Mr. Marchesi died on Dec. 26 in Milan. He was 87. The death was confirmed by the Fondazione Gualtiero Marchesi, which supports the fine arts and the culinary arts.
Mr. Marchesi was born on March 19, 1930, in Milan. He began learning the culinary trade by observing and working in the kitchen of the restaurant in his parents’ small hotel.
Mr. Marchesi mixed ideas he had picked up during his sojourn in France with regional Italian recipes and ingredients. One dish was a risotto adorned with a gold foil leaf.
Mr. Marchesi capitalized on his renown with numerous ventures — a line of frozen foods, for instance, and a signature Gualtiero Marchesi Liqueur. He closed his Milan restaurant in 1992 but quickly opened another about 45 miles to the east in the luxury hotel L’Albereta, in Erbusco. He was soon branching out further, providing managing services to other restaurants and striking a deal with the Costa cruise line to create menus for its ships.
With success came pressures, as Mr. Marchesi told The South China Morning Post in 1995 during a trip to Hong Kong as a guest chef.
Yet when Michelin dropped him from the guide entirely later that year, Mr. Marchesi was furious.
Some culinary figures mocked him, but Mr. Marchesi brushed off the criticisms.
Mr. Marchesi is survived by his wife, Antonietta Cassisa, whom he married in 1957; two daughters, Simona Marchesi Dandolo and Paola Marchesi Magada; and five grandchildren.
Stars or no, Mr. Marchesi was a pivotal figure for the current generation of Italian chefs.
