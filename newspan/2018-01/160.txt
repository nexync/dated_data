Diversity is increasing onstage on Broadway, according to a new study by the Asian American Performers Action Coalition.
The study, released Monday, examined the 2015-16 season and found it to be the most diverse the group has reviewed so far, with 35 percent of all roles going to minority actors, up from 30 percent the previous season and 24 percent the year before that. The coalition has now compiled 10 years of data on diversity on New York stages.
Plays lagged far behind musicals, with minority actors in only 16 percent of those roles. And most of that casting — 14 percent over all — went to African-American actors, boosted particularly by Danai Gurira’s “Eclipsed,” which is set in Liberia.
