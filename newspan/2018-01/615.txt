Late Thursday night, in response to a lawsuit brought by Mr. Ragbir’s lawyers, a Federal District Court judge in Manhattan granted him a temporary stay of removal and a hearing on Jan. 29 to determine whether the agents were right to detain him.
“It seems really clear to us that this is an escalation of retaliation, not just against individual rights leaders, but against the right of the movement to exist,” said Mary Small, the policy director for Detention Watch Network, an immigrant rights group.
Rachael Yong Yow, a spokeswoman for the New York field office of ICE, said in a statement on Thursday that in the last 12 years Mr. Ragbir’s immigration case has undergone extensive judicial review at multiple levels.
Ms. Gottlieb said she understood the legal disagreements over the case, but questioned the government’s lack of transparency in its operations.
“Basic human decency requires that his wife and lawyers know where he is, so that we don’t live in a country where people are whisked away to secret facilities,” Ms. Gottlieb said.
