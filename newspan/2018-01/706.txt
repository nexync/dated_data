To usher in the new year, we asked creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to detox, cleanse — and refresh.
As Mullin, 47, has settled into adulthood, she’s made some adjustments — she now regularly swims laps at the YMCA and practices yoga, both at home and in a studio. “I did, for the first time, self-consciously go to the grocery store with yoga clothing on — O.K., I covered my leggings with gauchos,” she says, “then I realized, everyone wears yoga clothes to the grocery store and nobody is looking at me, so get over it.” In terms of diet, Mullin’s bacon, egg and cheese has become a “Morning bruschetta.” She shares the recipe for that, as well as her version of a breakfast taco, below.
1. Remove the egg yolk from the hard-boiled egg (and toss it to the dog begging below). Chop up the rest.
2. Chop up the avocado.
3. Halve the tomatoes.
4. Toss it all together — plus olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper — and stack it on toasted English muffin halves.
Variant: For a Breakfast Taco, use Trader Joe’s corn & wheat tortillas fired over a stove’s flame instead of English muffins, and substitute lime for lemon.
