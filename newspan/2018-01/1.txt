What Sat on Trump’s Nightstand This Year?
A year into the Trump administration, Americans have a pretty good idea what the president has been watching on TV during his time in office, largely thanks to his active Twitter feed.
But if you look closely, Twitter gives us a sense of what President Trump may be reading as well. Indeed, here are the books that seem to have sat on the White House nightstand this year.
Forty-five days later at 5:13 in the morning, he called “Reasons to Vote for Democrats: A Comprehensive Guide,” by Michael J. Knowles, an American actor and conservative columnist, “a great book for your reading enjoyment.” The book consists entirely of blank pages.
In November, Democratic political strategist Donna Brazile’s “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House” was on the president’s mind. He said the “real story on Collusion” during the 2016 presidential race was in this book.
Clearly the “Trump bump” has an effect on book sales as well.
