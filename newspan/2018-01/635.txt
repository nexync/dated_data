ZEBULON, N.C. â€” At this century-old farm just outside Durham, symmetrical rows of shining blue solar panels have replaced the soybeans and tobacco that Tommy Vinson and his family used to grow here. It is one of many solar farms that have sprung up around North Carolina, transforming a state long battered by global offshoring into the second-largest generator of solar electricity after California.
Across North Carolina, textile factories and tobacco farms have disappeared, giving way to fields of solar panels.
