Hometown Howell, Mich.
Now Lives In a two-bedroom apartment in the East Village of Manhattan that he shares with a roommate.
Claim to Fame Mr. Wilson is a budding folk-pop musician and baby-faced model who appears on the most recent cover of Candy magazine, as well as in advertisements for the skimpy men’s underwear brand 2(x)ist. He is also something of an L.G.B.T. activist by being a plainly outspoken transgender man to his hundreds of thousands of followers on Facebook and Instagram. “Music has the power to bring people outside of the community into the community,” he said.
Big Break In March, about one year after he began transitioning, Mr. Wilson posted before-and-after photos (some shirtless) on Facebook that racked up 13 million views. The actress Ruby Rose commented that he was “looking like a young Channing Tatum.” The rapper Lil Wayne wrote, “Wow.” “People didn’t start listening to my music until after my transition, which is funny because I had to really practice to regain my singing voice because my vocal cords had changed so drastically,” Mr. Wilson said.
Latest Project In 2015, he started a clothing swap program in Michigan for transitioning men and women called T Is for Trans. But like most New Yorkers with small closets, he had to close up shop when he moved to the city. He still does the occasional giveaway of chest binders (compression garments that reduce the appearance of female breasts) through Instagram Stories. “Clothing is the last thing you want to think about when you’re spending most of your money on hormones and top surgery funds,” he said.
