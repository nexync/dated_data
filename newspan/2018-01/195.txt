Reporters often arrive on the red carpet armed with questions pegged to whatever controversy is the talk of the awards season. And there always is (at least) one.
In previous years, journalists have responded to the heat in Hollywood by asking celebrities about #AskHerMore, the initiative to query actresses about more substantive things than their outfits; #OscarsSoWhite, which highlighted the dearth of diverse nominees; and, more recently, the presidency of Donald J. Trump.
This year, it is the celebrities, in particular the women, who are defining the agenda. Women attending the Globes have been asked to wear black gowns to show solidarity with victims of sexual misconduct. The plan was initially dismissed as a toothless gimmick, one that would do little to advance the #MeToo movement. But the call to wear black gowns turned out to be part of a sweeping and ambitious initiative, called Time’s Up, created by some 300 prominent actresses and female agents, writers, directors and entertainment executives to fight sexual misconduct across the country. Time’s Up boasts a $14 million legal defense fund for less privileged victims, and has already secured pledges from talent agencies to achieve gender parity in their corner offices by 2020. The black gowns aren’t meant to just call attention to the problem, or mourn the industry’s old guard; they are pointing to solutions.
