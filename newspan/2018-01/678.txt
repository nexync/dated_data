A five-story building at 1466 Beach Avenue in the Bronx sold for more than $4 million.
A real estate fund, which owns a half-dozen other properties on the block, has bought this five-story 1930 walk-up with 30 rent-stabilized apartments — 18 one-bedrooms, 11 two-bedrooms and one four-bedroom. The 24,255-square-foot building sold for 10.72 times the rent roll, with a cap rate of 5.2 percent.
A beauty and wellness communications agency has signed a three-year lease for a 2,847-square-foot space on the sixth floor of this 12-story 1897 office building in the SoHo Cast Iron Historic District. The firm received two months of free rent for its build-out. The space, featuring 11-and-a-half-foot-high open ceilings, wood floors and an exposed brick wall, is to also have a new pantry, as well as new air-conditioning, by the time the tenant moves in next month. New York Models Management, a modeling agency, previously occupied the space.
This 41,000-square-foot 1940 seven-story elevator building, offering 4,451 square feet in additional air rights, has 44 apartments — three studios, three one-bedrooms, 36 two-bedrooms and two three-bedrooms — of which five are to be delivered vacant. Twenty-nine apartments are free market, 14 are rent-stabilized and one is rent-controlled. The cap rate is 2 percent.
