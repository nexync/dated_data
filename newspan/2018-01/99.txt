The resulting discussion mirrored the private discussions that I’ve observed many men, including my friends, having over the past few months.
Second, the men wondered how they could participate without being viewed as disingenuous — or elbowing out female voices. They sensed they could do more to help, but didn’t know how.
Lastly, they wondered: How should they be assessing their own past behavior in this brave new world?
One man, a former human-resources director, said he was reported for harassment in the ‘90s — unfairly, he believed — when he told a female colleague that “You were in my dream last night.” He didn’t mean it sexually, he said.
Another said that while he logically knew that false accusations are rare, he couldn’t help but worry that it could happen to him.
Some men said they saw a lot of themselves in Aziz Ansari, the actor who recently was accused in an online article of ignoring the verbal and nonverbal cues of a former date.  They wondered if and how often they missed those cues themselves.
“We’re all kind of guilty to an extent,” one of the men said.
As the men unloaded, the event’s female organizer, who goes by a pseudonym, “Lola Jean,” sat silently as promised. She said that while she disagreed with some of what she heard, she felt it was important for men to air their apprehensions — with the goal of better understanding how to address them.
“Ultimately, I believe it’s going to be men helping men in order to be better humans, better allies and better advocates,” she said.
