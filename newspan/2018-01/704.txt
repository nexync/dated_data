When to watch: Now, on Fox.com and Hulu.
This new comedy airs Wednesdays on Fox, but you’ve only missed one episode — catch up and jump in. Kim Matula stars as Ronnie, a flight attendant in a low-budget airline that only flies between, you guessed it, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. The show follows her, her co-workers and their frequent fliers, and it’s slick but still sunny. The zingy, reference-heavy style is reminiscent of “Happy Endings” or “The Mindy Project,” but without any of the underlying sentimentality.
When to watch: Starts Sunday at 7 p.m., on GSN.
It’s one of the best scandals in game show history: The seemingly random game board on “Press Your Luck” was, in fact, not random, and Michael Larson, an enterprising man, memorized its patterns, went on the show and stunned everyone when he won over $100,000. This one-hour documentary is just so-so, but watch it and then marvel at Larson’s two “Press Your Luck” appearances, which air after it. Imagine being in that audience and thinking you just saw the luckiest streak in history.
Season 3 of this rom-com charmer recently became available, but start at the beginning to get the full will-they-won’t-they effect. Johnny Flynn stars as Dylan, who learns he has a sexually transmitted disease and has to contact his former partners, and the show bounces back and forth in time, from the present day back to those older relationships. The characters have a lot of sex, sure. But “Lovesick” is much more about love — romantic and platonic — than sex. If you liked “Four Weddings and a Funeral,” try this.
