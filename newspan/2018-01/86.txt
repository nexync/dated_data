Mr. Copley, 84, has been one of the opera world’s foremost directors for decades. He was at the Met directing a revival of his 1990 production of Rossini’s “Semiramide” when a member of the chorus reported that Mr. Copley had made him uncomfortable at a rehearsal on Friday with a sexually charged remark, according to two people familiar with the complaint.
William Guerri, Mr. Copley’s manager at Columbia Artists, could not immediately be reached for comment.
The news of the firing stunned the opera world, and a number of prominent British critics and singers who have worked with him complained on social media that it seemed like an overreaction.
Mr. Copley’s dismissal came as the Met has been investigating accusations against its former music director, James Levine, whom it suspended in December after The New York Times reported the accounts of four men who said that he had sexually abused them decades ago, when the men were teenagers or his students. Mr. Levine has denied the accusations.
Questions have been raised about what Met officials knew about Mr. Levine’s suspected behavior, given that he had been with the company for more than four decades and that rumors about his private life had swirled for nearly that long. In the case of Mr. Copley, the company acted swiftly after receiving a complaint.
