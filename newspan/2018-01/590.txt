Opinion|Are Republicans Ready to Join a Third Party?
WASHINGTON — Want to know what a lot of Republicans have been thinking about in the days leading up to Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address to a Republican-controlled Congress?
A new party.
And if surveys have any truth to them, plenty of Americans are ready to join them. A September Gallup poll found 61 percent of American voters support the idea of a third major political party, the highest level of support Gallup had ever recorded. Young voters seem especially eager to junk the two-party system; NBC reported in November that 71 percent of millennials want another choice.
In a world in which Alabama voters elected a Democratic senator, all kinds of previously unimaginable possibilities make a new kind of sense. A third-party presidency in 2020 is no less likely today than the prospect of Donald Trump’s election appeared to be two years ago.
A viable third-party candidate — say, someone with credibility inside one of the parties who bolts from it — would have appeal to voters across the spectrum. There are many Republicans wary of a second term for Mr. Trump, and yet right now they are entirely reliant on the Democrats to deliver a winning centrist candidate out of a primary process that almost made Bernie Sanders their 2016 nominee. A contest between Mr. Trump and a liberal Democratic candidate like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts would leave the middle up for grabs. And a big contingent of politically orphaned political strategists, academics and donors would be ready to lend support.
Will outraged voters fall in line behind a resurgent Democratic Party or fuel the rise of a new major party? Abraham Lincoln was the last representative of a new political party to be elected president. He won in 1860 as the nominee of the anti-slavery Republican Party after he gained notice for his debates with Stephen Douglas during his 1858 Senate run.
Lincoln lost that Senate race, but he became famous as a voice of moral clarity. Lincoln’s eventual win resulted not from a party affiliation but from the moral authority he commanded as an opponent of slavery. It’s not hard to imagine that a morally lucid third-party candidate for president in 2020 — displaying unshakable commitment to democracy, truth and human rights — might enjoy similar success.
But what about the Electoral College? A presidential candidate needs 270 of the 538 electoral votes to win the White House; if no candidate reaches that number, the House decides the winner. That’s a high hurdle; the last third-party candidate to win even one Electoral College vote was John Hospers, a Libertarian Party candidate, in 1972.
That doesn’t mean it would be impossible. Do the math. Tally the votes cast in states in which the number of Republicans and Democrats is roughly equal, especially those that have shown movement one way or the other in recent elections, along with traditional battleground states. There are some significant caches of votes: Florida, North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Louisiana — it’s not hard to get to 268. Add the three votes from Maine, with its history of supporting third-party candidates, and the total is 271 Electoral College votes. Pick a candidate attractive to voters in a large state like California, with its 55 delegates, and the path gets easier.
A popular, well-known candidate could co-opt a minor party and inherit its ballot access. But with money and expertise, starting a new party isn’t out of reach: The financier Peter Ackerman and the political reformer Kahlil Byrd led a 2012 effort, Americans Elect, that got on the ballot in a majority of states (staged as an effort to build a national primary, Americans Elect didn’t nominate a candidate).
Given that two-thirds of Americans don’t believe President Trump to be trustworthy, almost anyone could be a candidate for a serious third-party run if he started early enough to gain full ballot access. Ask your neighbor whether the idea of a Joe Biden-Ben Sasse independent ticket is appealing — with Mr. Biden pledging to serve only four years (to address concerns about his age). Jeff Flake or Bob Corker could be a contender.
Another possibility: a business executive with a record of sound leadership, moral authority and a quick wit: the financier David Rubenstein, Ginni Rometty of IBM or Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, perhaps? How about a centrist Republican governor like Larry Hogan of Maryland, John Kasich of Ohio or Charlie Baker of Massachusetts? And then, of course, there’s Oprah.
In the post-Trump world of American politics, there are all kinds of potential candidates who make sudden sense.  Personality and principles — either adoration or abnegation thereof — will propel the election of the next president.
