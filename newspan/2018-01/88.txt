PRAY ME STAY EAGER By Ellen Doré Watson. (Alice James Books, paper, $15.95.) On the evidence of this exuberant poetry collection, her fifth, Watson (who directs the Poetry Center at Smith College) has stayed eager indeed. One poem describes frogs “going nutso down in that sinkhole / pond,” and closes, “they could care / less whether I thank or curse them / for their farty calls speaking sex.” WILD IS THE WIND By Carl Phillips. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) The love poems in Phillips’s 14th collection embrace the paradox of desire and stability, with his customary long lines and discursive, inquisitive voice. BULLETS INTO BELLS: POETS AND CITIZENS RESPOND TO GUN VIOLENCE Edited by Brian Clements, Alexandra Teague and Dean Rader. (Beacon Press, paper, $15.) Clements conceived of this anthology, made up of poems about gun violence and responses from affected readers, after his wife, a teacher, survived the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Contributing poets include Natasha Trethewey, Ada Limón and Ocean Vuong — as well as Clements himself, whose poem “22” concludes with the events of that day and ends, despairingly, “After that, a lot of other things happened, / but it doesn’t really matter what.” COLLECTED POEMS By Galway Kinnell. (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $35.) Kinnell, who died in 2014, was a towering figure in American poetry, publishing 10 collections over 65 years; in 1982, his “Selected Poems” won both a Pulitzer and a National Book Award. This is the first volume to gather all of his work in one place.
