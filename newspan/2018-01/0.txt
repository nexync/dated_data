There’s a lot to look forward to, or at least be curious about, on television and streaming this winter. New series will arrive starring Anna Paquin (WGN’s “Bellevue”), Sean Bean (“The Oath” on Crackle) and Tim Robbins and Holly Hunter (HBO’s “Here and Now”). “UnReal” on Lifetime and “Strike Back” on Cinemax return after long hiatuses. High-profile projects like “The Alienist” on TNT, “Philip K. Dick’s Electric Dreams” on Amazon, “The Looming Tower” on Hulu and “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story” on FX are generating their own buzz. And favorites like AMC’s “The Walking Dead,” PBS’s “Call the Midwife,” Showtime’s “Homeland” and IFC’s “Portlandia” (in its final season) promise to bring happiness to their fans. All that plus this very abbreviated list of particular highlights.
