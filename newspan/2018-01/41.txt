The Philippine Constitution dictates that mass media entities must be wholly owned and managed by Filipinos. The Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines is mandated, among others, to ensure that media businesses are faithfully observing this constitutional provision.
The commission’s chairwoman, Teresita Herbosa, who said she would defend “to the hilt” the commission’s decision to revoke the online news site Rappler’s license, is known to me as a person of unimpeachable character. She is highly respected within legal and policy circles for her commitment to the rule of law and to the public interest.
Efforts to impute political motivation to this case do a great disservice to Ms. Herbosa and the institution she leads.
The commission’s decision is about upholding the law. It has no bearing on the state of press freedom in the Philippines, where thousands of broadcast stations and newspapers continue to operate unhampered.
We respect the S.E.C.’s decision. No one, including media organizations, should be exempt from complying with the law.
