In 1996, when war broke out in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, just 31 northern white rhinos remained in Garamba National Park, the last stronghold of this endangered species. Armed militias reached the park less than a year later, and half of the parkâ€™s elephants, two-thirds of its buffalos and three-quarters of its hippos disappeared in three short months.
