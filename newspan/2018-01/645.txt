TUESDAY PUZZLE — I don’t often comment on relative day order of the puzzles because it can be a subjective thing, but I did feel like Zhouqin Burnikel’s Tuesday puzzle could have worked as the Monday this week. It could just be me, but I thought the cluing was clear and smooth and the theme was relatively easy. The reason this wasn’t a Monday puzzle was most likely because the theme clues required you to mentally reverse course and think of the opposite thing the clue indicated. It’s not as straight forward as just recalling the names of songs, as we did yesterday.
Still, today is the first official work day of 2018, so it’s great to have a smooth Burnikel grid to help get our solving mojo up to 11. Think of it this way: If you had a grid you had to struggle with, you’d go to work feeling terrible about yourself and you wouldn’t get anything done. Never say that the editors aren’t thinking about you.
Ms. Burnikel goes rogue today by encouraging us all to disobey orders consisting of familiar phrases, like “Disobey a standing order?” for HAVE A SEAT. You should be able to get the rest on your own, you disobedient people.
2D: General rule: If the entry OLAV or OLAF is in a puzzle, it will be not be spelled the way you think. Always choose the other one. Today, the answer is OLAV, because I could have sworn it was OLAF.
