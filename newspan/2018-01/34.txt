In their push to highlight the problems of sexual harassment and gender inequality, eight actresses at Sunday night’s Golden Globes ceremony are extending their political statements to their plus-ones.
Laura Dern, Amy Poehler, Susan Sarandon, Meryl Streep, Emma Stone, Emma Watson, Michelle Williams and Shailene Woodley say that on the red carpet, they will each be accompanied by activists in a range of fields. The move is part of a widening effort by prominent Hollywood women, who formed the umbrella group Time’s Up, to extend the focus on sexual harassment to women marginalized because of class, sexuality, ethnicity or race.
The initiative’s efforts range from the establishment of a legal fund to fight sexual harassment to symbolic statements like wearing black on the red carpet and now inviting activists to the Globes.
In a joint statement, the eight activists said they hoped that by attending the Golden Globes, they would redirect attention from abusers to survivors and lasting solutions.
— Marai Larasi, executive director of Imkaan, a British network of organizations working to end violence against black and minority women, will be Ms. Watson’s guest.
— Calina Lawrence, a Suquamish Tribe member, singer and activist for, among other causes, Native American treaty and water rights, will be going with Ms. Woodley.
— Saru Jayaraman, a workplace justice advocate for restaurant workers, will be Ms. Poehler’s guest.
