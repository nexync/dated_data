When the plot of a dystopian novel and the daily churn of the news cycle start overlapping, admiration for a given author’s prescience may make way for alarm.
Ms. Reagon, whose musical adaptation of the novel is the centerpiece of the Public Theater’s Under the Radar festival, is the granddaughter of a Baptist minister. Her parents became musical luminaries of the civil rights era and beyond: the late Cordell Hull Reagon founded the Freedom Singers, while Dr. Bernice Johnson Reagon performed with that group as well as with another a cappella ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock.
Her adaptation of “Parable of the Sower” is deeply rooted in the African-American sacred music that might be called her family inheritance. But it also incorporates soul, funk, the blues and even a whiff of EDM — “a couple hundred years’ of music that comes out of our country,” Ms. Reagon said.
The festival bills it simply as an opera.
Ms. Reagon began working on the show about 10 years ago, collaborating with her mother, but Dr. Reagon has since retired from writing and performing.
Ms. Reagon said it was a challenge to sort out which elements from Butler’s dense novel could be musicalized.
As a youth, Ms. Reagon would stay up late at night to devour Butler’s books, she said.
And if that future starts looking more and more like a dystopian vision?
It’s a new year, so why not try something new? The five performance festivals opening this month in New York will help adventurous theatergoers do just that. These showcases tend to highlight the experimental and the offbeat. Some firsts this year will also be lasts. On Jan. 10, the Coil festival will inaugurate the renovated home of Performance Space 122 in the East Village, but this will be the festival’s final installment. It will be replaced by year-round programming.
