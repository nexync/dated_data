We asked readers what they are doing to get involved in politics in their communities.
A year after millions of people participated in the Women’s March to protest Donald Trump’s inauguration, demonstrators across the United States took to the streets on Saturday to speak out against the president and his administration’s policies.
A poem by the activist, poet and writer Cleo Wade about being an active citizen prompted us to ask readers how they’ll be getting involved in politics in their communities. Below is Ms. Wade’s poem, followed by lightly edited responses from readers.
Anita Hill’s testimony still sends chills down my spine, because my friend who is a DREAMER is living in a constant state of fear, or because there are thousands of Puerto Rican Americans who have lost everything and are still living in darkness.
Because I know that equal pay for equal work does not exist.
And when I see that 1 in 4 black people in Florida cannot vote, it is clear to me that equal voting rights do not exist either.
Because the land of the free is locking millions of human beings in cages, shackling women during childbirth, and putting our children in solitary confinement.
I know that Nazis are planning to march again, because Flint still has no clean drinking water.
Because I know that 40 percent of our homeless population are LGBTQ youths and there is something wrong with that.
Because I don’t want to have to teach my children how to do nuclear bomb drills, or what to wear to avoid sexual harassment or how to behave to avoid a “justifiable shooting” by the police.
Because I hugged Trayvon Martin’s mother last year and told her I would keep going.
I give more of my time.
I give more of my dollars.
I give more of my heart.
I give more spirit.
