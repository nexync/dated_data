LONDON — The government of Wales has a question for parents: Is it ever right to physically punish your children?
It began a 12-week feedback process on the issue on Tuesday, with officials saying they hoped to join more than 50 countries that have adopted an outright ban on the practice.
They would also be following the example of Scotland, which announced plans for a ban after a consultation of its own last summer.
Some opposition to a ban has already gathered. A group called Be Reasonable, named after an exemption in current assault laws for “reasonable punishment” of children by parents, says it has more than 1,500 names on a petition against the proposal, in a nation of a little over 3 million people.
“Every child is different and needs different types of discipline,” Mrs. Robins argued, adding that such decisions should be made by the parent and not the government.
But Welsh government officials say physical punishment is outdated and ineffective, and can have negative long-term effects.
“If there is any potential risk of harm to a child, then it is our obligation as a government to take action,” Mr. Irranca-Davies said.
Sarah Lewis, a nanny of two children in the Welsh capital, Cardiff, said a ban was crucial to protect children because every parent or guardian had a different understanding of what “reasonable” punishment meant.
Mr. Irranca-Davies said the consultation would help the government address concerns as the legislation develops.
