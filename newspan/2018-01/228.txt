We’ve Heard It All Before. Shutdown Talk in 2013 Compared to Today.
WASHINGTON — It’s déjà vu. The fiery rhetoric that lawmakers lobbed at each other in 2013, during the last government shutdown, echoes today as another shutdown took effect beginning at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time, Saturday.
The sentiments on Twitter, in floor speeches and interviews are similar, but who is saying them has changed. In 2013, during the Obama administration, the Democrats had control of the Senate and the Republicans controlled the House. Now, under President Trump, the Republicans control both chambers.
Here’s a look at the statements made and who said them, now that the political roles are largely reversed.
Here’s what Mr. Trump had to say about the shutdown in 2013.
So far, Mr. Obama has remained silent on the shutdown.
“We’re going to have to go in a different direction. Ideally, we would all roll up our sleeves and try to reach an agreement on all of the issues we need to resolve,” Mr. Schumer said.
Mr. Mulvaney was then Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, and a member of the House Freedom Caucus, which was largely blamed for setting off the shutdown. His office released the following statement during the shutdown.
Now, Mr. Mulvaney is the president’s budget director and the acting director of the Consumer and Financial Protection Bureau.
Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, was then the chairman of the House Budget Committee.
“Right now, we need to find common ground. We need to open the federal government. We need to pay our bills today — and make sure we can pay our bills tomorrow,” Mr. Ryan wrote in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal.
Now, as Speaker of the House, Mr. Ryan’s words carry the weight of congressional leadership.
