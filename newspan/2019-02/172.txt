But maybe you don’t want to be bummed out by the news about the news. Maybe you prefer to read thrillers, like JoAnn Chaney’s “As Long as We Both Shall Live,” about deadly tensions in a marriage, or Un-Su Kim’s “The Plotters,” about a Korean assassin. Maybe you like music, in which case Hanif Abdurraqib’s study of the hip-hop band A Tribe Called Quest, “Go Ahead in the Rain,” would be good company. (For that matter so would Tom Barbash’s new novel, “The Dakota Winters,” which features John Lennon in a significant neighborly role.) Maybe you want to know more about the insidious persistence of anti-Semitism, from Deborah Lipstadt’s authoritative new book on the subject, or just hang out with a fascinating mind, which you can do with Kathleen Collins’s posthumous collection “Notes From a Black Woman’s Diary.” That one has a little bit of everything — plays, short stories, diary entries, a novel excerpt — and even though Collins died more than 30 years ago, it delivers its own kind of news.
NOTES FROM A BLACK WOMAN’S DIARY: Selected Works of Kathleen Collins, edited by Nina Lorez Collins. (Ecco/HarperCollins, paper, $17.99.) The writer and filmmaker Kathleen Collins died in 1988, at the age of 46 — young, brilliant and, for the most part, unknown. Her work — including “Whatever Happened to Interracial Love?,” a collection of short stories published for the first time in 2016 — has been rediscovered and embraced in recent years. Now a new book has arrived, “Notes From a Black Woman’s Diary,” a grab bag of letters, diary entries, short stories, plays and screenplays. “Her voice and vision are idiosyncratic and pitiless, combining mischief and crisp authority, formal experimentation and deep feeling,” our critic Parul Sehgal writes.
