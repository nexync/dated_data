We’ve been excluded from basic labor protections for too long. This is our moment.
In the Video Op-Ed above, a domestic worker calls on Congress to pass the first National Domestic Workers’ Bill of Rights. While labor protections exist for factory workers, truck drivers, teachers, they do not exist for domestic and care workers. This bill would end their exclusion.
The National Domestic Workers Alliance has written an open letter dedicated to the women of the Oscar-nominated film “Roma”: Liboria Rodriguez, the director Alfonso Cuaron’s childhood nanny and inspiration for Cleo; and Yalitza Aparicio, whose portrayal of Cleo brought her to life with humanity and dignity. You can read their letter here.
