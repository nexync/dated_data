Link20, a group of young activists sponsored by the Ruderman foundation, sent a letter to M.L.B. in November raising the issue. “Using the term ‘disabled list’ for players who are injured reinforces the belief that people with disabilities are injured and therefore are not able to participate or compete in any sports,” it said.
Some fans on Twitter lamented the change, complaining that they could no longer use the well-known abbreviation “D.L.” But a good number welcomed the switch.
The list will continue to work as it has in the past. Just not as the disabled list, or “the D.L.” — at least until people in baseball stop saying it.
