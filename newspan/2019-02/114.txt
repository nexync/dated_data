Is Religious Freedom for Christians Only?
Domineque Hakim Marcelle Ray wanted an imam by his side when he was executed. The Supreme Court said no.
Late on Thursday, the Supreme Court again sent that message, this time to a Muslim death-row prisoner, Domineque Hakim Marcelle Ray, who was awaiting execution in Alabama for the 1995 rape and killing of a 15-year-old girl from Selma.
A day earlier, an appeals court had put Mr. Ray’s execution on hold because judges wanted more time to assess whether a policy at Holman Correctional Facility, where Mr. Ray was set to be executed, violated the Constitution’s prohibition against religious favoritism by the government.
Mr. Ray wanted an imam by his side when he was put to death. But at Holman, the Alabama Department of Corrections employs only a chaplain — a Christian minister. And prison officials said that allowing Mr. Ray’s imam to be present would pose security concerns.
Mr. Ray contended that the presence of a minister rather than an imam in the death chamber was a violation of his First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion.
On a 5-to-4 vote, the high court on Thursday allowed the execution to proceed. The imam, Yusef Maisonet, watched Mr. Ray die from behind glass.
The five more conservative members of the Supreme Court seemed unmoved by Mr. Ray’s request for an accommodation. They reasoned, in a terse and unsigned order, that he should have raised his religious concerns sooner.
