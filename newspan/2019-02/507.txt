What led to the forced relocation?
In the early 1800s, the federal government made an agreement with Georgia to remove all Native Americans from the state. But little was done to enforce it immediately, according to Dr. Weaver.
Then, in 1829, gold was discovered on Cherokee land in northern Georgia, which ramped up efforts to dislodge the Cherokees, according to the Trail of Tears Association. Around the same time, Andrew Jackson became president and began to “aggressively” pursue a policy of relocating Native populations, the association said.
Jackson signed into law the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which authorized the government to relocate Indian tribes in exchange for unsettled territory in the west.
Most Native Americans opposed the policy, and the Cherokee Nation brought a lawsuit in the United States Supreme Court. In one ruling, in 1832, the court sided with the Cherokees, Dr. Weaver said.
In 1835, a faction of Cherokees signed a treaty with the federal government agreeing to move west to Indian Territory. The agreement, the Treaty of New Echota, “was illegal under the laws of the Cherokee Nation,” Dr. Weaver said, but it went into effect anyway.
“The Senate ratified the treaty despite knowledge that only a minority of Cherokees had accepted it,” the Trail of Tears Association said on its website.
What is the legacy of the Trail of Tears?
In 1987, Congress designated the Trail of Tears a national historic trail. It covers nine states and thousands of miles.
Because of what is taught in school, many people have limited knowledge of events like the Trail of Tears and Wounded Knee, Ms. Richards said. “They’ve heard these terms, but they really don’t understand,” she said.
She advocated more Native American voices in Hollywood, the news media and the education system.
