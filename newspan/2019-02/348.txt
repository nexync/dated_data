An Optional Emergency?
President Trump declared on Friday that he would use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall, sidestepping Congress. The announcement met with immediate blowback: Sixteen states are suing, and on late-night TV on Monday, various hosts attacked the president for it.
Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers pointed out that Trump had said on Friday that he “didn’t need to do this,” but was declaring the emergency in order to build the wall “much faster” — a statement that seemed to contradict the very definition of an emergency.
Meyers pointed out that building a wall along a nearly 2,000-mile border didn’t seem like an emergency solution.
Both Meyers and Jimmy Fallon had some fun with the news that a woman had delivered a baby during a JetBlue flight.
