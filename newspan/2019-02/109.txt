“Supervised release” allows judges to let those who cannot afford bail be released before trial on a kind of parole — and it may be what finally helps close Rikers Island.
This seemingly simple choice shapes the trajectory of the case and the defendant’s prospects. Detained and enduring the discomforts and dangers of jail, the accused may grudgingly accept a guilty plea just to resolve the case. A 2018 study in the American Economic Review showed that defendants whose circumstances were otherwise alike were about 10 percent more likely to plead guilty if they had been held in jail before trial.
And those who do not plead guilty may endure even bleaker ordeals. Kalief Browder, the 16-year-old who became the face of pretrial reform, was held on Rikers for three years for allegedly swiping a backpack, all the while maintaining his innocence, before prosecutors ultimately dropped the charges for lack of evidence. Browder struggled in the aftermath of his release, and two years later killed himself. Last week his family was awarded $3.3 million to settle a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city.
Whereas programs elsewhere may monitor defendants through electronic ankle bracelets and mandatory drug-testing — prompting reformers like Michelle Alexander to warn that they “contain the seeds of the next generation of racial and social control” — New York City doesn’t incorporate either practice.
Then there is the possibility that supervised release is ensnaring people who pose little risk at all. Instead of only liberating defendants who might have been held in jail until trial, judges may be mandating defendants to supervision who they would have otherwise released unconditionally.
Defense attorneys in Brooklyn say they see this wider net being cast, and there is some data to confirm their concerns. Between 2016 and 2018, the mix of people enrolled in their borough’s program has shifted slightly toward those assessed to be at a lower risk of felony rearrest.
