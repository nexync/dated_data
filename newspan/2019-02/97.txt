Air travelers who want to will soon be able to choose a gender option other than “male” or “female” when buying their tickets.
The new “undisclosed” or “unspecified” options are meant to make things easier for travelers and airlines as a growing number of local, state and national governments issue identification documents with alternative gender choices, according to Airlines for America, a trade group that represents many major United States carriers.
“U.S. airlines value a culture of diversity and inclusion, both in the workplace and for our passengers,” the group said in a statement.
The Transportation Security Administration requires that travelers have gender markers associated with their tickets that match the identification documents they present at agency checkpoints. The new standard will make it easier for passengers who are gender nonconforming to travel with documents that more accurately represent their identities.
Transgender rights groups said the new options were good for all travelers, and especially for those who are transgender.
Alaska Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are also working on introducing the new gender options, representatives for the carriers said, as is Delta Air Lines, which is not an Airlines for America member.
