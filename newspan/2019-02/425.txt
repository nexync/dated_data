Ahead of the Oscars on Sunday, we asked co-chief film critic Manohla Dargis and critic-at-large Wesley Morris for their favorite books about old Hollywood. Below are their suggestions, as well as novels recommended by the Book Review editors.
In our reviewer’s telling, West appears to believe Hollywood has “too many lost people,” who “freed in their new anonymity from the restraints of the village life from which they have escaped, form a tragic chorus for the glamour boys and girls under movie contract.” The book primarily follows Tod Hackett, a young artist hired by a studio to do scene design, but readers are introduced to a wide cast of characters, including out-of-work actors, parents of child performers and more.
In Chandler’s first book in the Philip Marlowe series, detective Marlowe is hired by a dying millionaire to deal with a blackmailer targeting one of his two daughters. “As a study in depravity, the story is excellent, with Marlowe standing out as almost the only fundamentally decent person in it,” wrote our reviewer.
Our reviewer called this novel “just about perfect,” saying that Didion “writes with a razor, carving her characters out of her perceptions with strokes so swift and economical that each scene ends almost before the reader is aware of it.” Didion tells the story of Maria Wyeth, an ex-model adrift in California after a disastrous marriage to a filmmaker, who is attempting to rescue her daughter from a mental institution.
