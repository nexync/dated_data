We’re asking servicewomen and veterans to share their experiences in the military for a coming story. Tell us about your accomplishments, the challenges you faced, a fact about women in the military that would surprise most people or one unforgettable story you’ll never forget from your time in the service.
We’re looking for photos, anecdotes, journal entries and more. Alternatively, if a woman in your family served in the military, please tell us about that person, why she is important to you and send us a photo.
