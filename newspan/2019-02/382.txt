What is a person of principle to do when the ruler he serves is consumed with reckless vanity?
For Sir Thomas More, the sharp-witted chancellor at the center of Robert Bolt’s “A Man for All Seasons,” there is no question of following along. Even when he’s sent to the Tower, his life in peril, he remains a quietly intransigent dissenter to the rampaging egomania of King Henry VIII.
“This is not the stuff of which martyrs are made,” More says of himself to his wife, Lady Alice. But he’ll prove that assurance wrong, and when he does — in Christa Scott-Reed’s fitful production in the Acorn Theater at Theater Row — the forced sundering of their bond will genuinely sting. With Michael Countryman as a mild, sweet More and Carolyn McCormick as a fiery, steely Alice, the fond tenderness between them is the anchor of the play.
The king (Trent Dawson) is not that kind of husband, of course. He’s determined to trade his queen for a newer model, and if that means breaking with the pope and declaring himself the head of a new church, so be it. Viewing this course as a violation of divine law, More refuses to endorse it and is charged with treason.
Ms. Scott-Reed’s uneven staging gets in the way of cohesiveness, though. So does the busy set (by Steven C. Kemp), which seems intended to jazz up proceedings that could do with simplifying to help complex dialogue land. The laugh lines often stumble, too.
But this production otherwise denies More the requisite worthy adversaries, which throws off the equilibrium and dulls the storytelling. There’s no grandeur to Mr. Dawson’s Henry, and the whims of his mercurial mind feel less sudden than scripted.
Late in the performance, sound effects (by John Gromada) abruptly intrude — murmurs of an unseen courtroom crowd, caught up in the drama. In a more coherent production, we might have been, too.
