Hard work and discipline help girls outperform boys in class, but that advantage disappears in the work force. Is school the problem?
Dr. Damour is a clinical psychologist.
We need to ask: What if school is a confidence factory for our sons, but only a competence factory for our daughters?
So how do we get hyper-conscientious girls (and boys, as there certainly are some with the same style) to build both confidence and competence at school?
Even if neither you nor your daughter cares about becoming a chief executive, you may worry that she will eventually be crushed by the weight of her own academic habits. While a degree of stress promotes growth, working at top speed in every class at all times is unhealthy and unsustainable for even the most dedicated high school students. A colleague of mine likes to remind teenagers that in classes where any score above 90 counts as an A, the difference between a 91 and a 99 is a life.
To be sure, the confidence gap is hardly the only thing keeping women out of top jobs.  But confidence at school is one unequal advantage that we can address right now. Instead of standing by as our daughters make 50 flashcards when they were assigned 20, we can step in and ask them why. Many professional men brim with confidence because they have spent years getting to know their abilities. Women should arrive in the work world having done the same.
