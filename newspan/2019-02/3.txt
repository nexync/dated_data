Mr. Neeson, 66, responded to the outrage over his remarks on Tuesday. In an interview on “Good Morning America,” he said he later felt awful about his “primal urge” to hurt someone after the woman told him she had been raped.
Mr. Neeson said he sought help, eventually talking about the episode with his priest and friends. He also said he found an outlet to shed his violent thoughts by taking brisk two-hour walks every day. His friend died five years ago, he said.
The film company Lionsgate, which is distributing his new film, did not respond on Monday to requests for comment about his remarks to The Independent.
In the interview with The Independent, Mr. Neeson said he had never publicly talked about the episode before.
Mr. Neeson cast the episode as a parable on the pointlessness of seeking revenge and connected it back to the conflict in Northern Ireland, which officially ended in 1998.
