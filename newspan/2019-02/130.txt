This 22-foot-wide five-story mixed-use townhouse, built in 1872 as one of 11 single-family rowhouses, is available in the Lenox Hill section of the Upper East Side Historic District. In 1903, the townhouse became home to William H. Woodin, a coin collector who later served as Treasury secretary under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1919, the 8,046-square-foot property was updated with a new Flemish bond-and-brick facade. An antiques dealer occupies a commercial duplex, using the ground floor as an office and the floor above as a gallery. The third floor houses another art gallery, and the top two floors have two apartments — a three-bedroom duplex and an alcove penthouse studio. The building also features two rear terraces, an elevator, seven wood-burning fireplaces and seven skylights.
An investor in Bronx multifamily buildings has bought this five-story walk-up with 41 rent-stabilized apartments — 29 one-bedrooms and 12 two-bedrooms. The building is in an opportunity zone, offering the buyer a potential break on capital gains taxes. Slightly more than 50 percent of the tenants pay preferential rents, a discount given by the landlord for a set period, as defined by leases. The 38,237-square-foot property, about a block from a station for the 2 and 5 subway lines, also has 14 years left of a J-51 abatement, originally 34 years.

LaDuca Dance Shoes, run by Phil LaDuca, a former dancer and choreographer, is moving to a 2,300-square-foot ground-floor space from its location at 319 West 47th Street. The new space has 13-foot ceilings in a gut-renovated five-story mixed-use loft building. The designer has signed a 10-year lease, with two five-year options to renew, and received a three-month rent concession for the build out. His flexible dance shoes, constructed in Italy, have been worn by performers in hundreds of Broadway shows and elsewhere, including Judi Dench, Angela Lansbury and Liza Minnelli.
