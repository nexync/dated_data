President Trump and Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, ended their second summit meeting early on Thursday after they failed to agree on steps toward lifting sanctions and denuclearization.
He’s quite a guy and quite a character. And I think our relationship is very strong, but at this time, we had some options and at this time we’ve decided not to do any of the options. Sometimes you have to walk. And this was just one of those times. Basically, they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn’t do that. They were willing to denuke a large portion of the areas that we wanted, but we couldn’t give up all of the sanctions for that. So we continue to work, and we’ll see, but we had to walk away from that particular suggestion.
HANOI, Vietnam — The United States and North Korea offered conflicting accounts and traded blame on Thursday after a second summit meeting between President Trump and the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, ended abruptly without any agreement on nuclear disarmament or easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
He said Mr. Kim had offered to dismantle the North’s most important nuclear facility if the United States lifted the harsh sanctions imposed on his nation — but would not commit to do the same for other elements of its weapons program.
That, Mr. Trump said, was a dealbreaker.
But in a late-night news conference, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, contradicted Mr. Trump, saying the North had asked only for some sanctions to be lifted in exchange for “permanently and completely” dismantling the main facility in the presence of American experts.
“Given the current level of trust between North Korea and the United States, this was the maximum step for denuclearization we could offer,” Mr. Ri told reporters.
He added that the North’s position would not change. “This kind of opportunity may never come again,” he said.
