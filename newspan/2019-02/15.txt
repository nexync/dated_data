Halfway through Black History Month, and who knows how long into the latest news cycle involving politicians and their explosive pasts, might we recommend a couple of appropriate books? One offers historical context: Richard Gergel’s “Unexampled Courage” tells the true story of a black World War II veteran who was blinded at the hands of a Southern sheriff, and examines how his case spurred a white judge to champion the civil rights movement in its early days. The other offers Afrocentric escapism and fantasy: Marlon James’s best-selling new novel, “Black Leopard, Red Wolf,” draws on ancient myths and recent pop culture as it launches an epic tale about the fight for a lost kingdom. Either of those would be good reading for the rest of the month, or beyond.
We also have a memoir about the hard work of cleaning other people’s houses, a look at the AIDS crisis in India, a rigorous history of the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown, and the posthumous memoir of a young mother chronicling her fight against cancer. If all of that sounds a little heavy — a person can take only so much gloom at once, after all, even a person who believes in facing the world head-on — then you might be inspired by Seth Fletcher’s account of the scientists who are working to photograph a black hole, or transported by Janet Malcolm’s characteristically crisp and wide-ranging cultural essays, or diverted by Karen Thompson Walker’s novel about an epidemic of sleep that descends on a California town. Read that one in bed, and we’ll see you next week.
