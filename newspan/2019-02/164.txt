The series as a whole left an indelible, lightning-shaped mark on our heads and hearts as the world followed the adventures of the Boy Who Lived.
Among the magical objects Ms. Rowling conjured for her series was the Pensieve, a large, shallow bowl “made of metal or stone, often elaborately decorated or inlaid with precious stones [and runes], and carrying powerful and complex enchantments. Pensieves are rare, because only the most advanced wizards ever use them, and because the majority of wizardkind is afraid of doing so,” according to the website Pottermore.com.
The name “Pensieve” is a pun, using the homonym “pensive” to denote deep thought, and the word “sieve” to suggest the sorting of the mass of thoughts and memories within.
