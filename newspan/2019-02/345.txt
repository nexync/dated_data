The signature newsmagazine, which has held down a Sunday night slot for CBS since 1968, named Bill Owens as its executive producer.
In its announcement, CBS said Mr. Owens would report directly to Susan Zirinsky, the incoming president and senior executive producer of CBS News. That was a telling inclusion. Outside lawyers who conducted a monthslong investigation of sexual harassment at the network last year reported that the separation of the “60 Minutes” staff from the rest of the news division meant that the show was unable to prevent inappropriate conduct by some of its top executives.
In a statement, Ms. Zirinsky praised Mr. Owens, a popular figure among the “60 Minutes” rank and file who got his first experience at CBS as a summer intern in 1988.
Mr. Owens joined “60 Minutes” in 2003, working with the correspondent Scott Pelley to cover Hurricane Katrina and the genocide in Sudan. After a stint at “CBS Evening News,” he rejoined the newsmagazine in 2007 as a senior broadcast producer. In 2008 he was named executive editor.
Mr. Owens is the third executive producer of the newsmagazine in its more than 50-year history. The show has maintained high ratings throughout its time on the air, and remains among the top 10 most-viewed television programs.
Its founder was Don Hewitt, a journalistic legend who led the show for 36 years. But, as The New York Times reported in December, investigators who examined the corporate culture at the network revealed that CBS continued to pay a settlement to a woman who claimed that he had sexually assaulted her on repeated occasions and destroyed her career. The settlement, reached in the 1990s, was amended multiple times, including last year. In total, CBS agreed to pay the former employee more than $5 million.
