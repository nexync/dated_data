The installation, “ParaPivot,” will be on view from April 16 through Oct. 27, the artist’s first institutional solo exhibition in New York.
Born in Poland in 1979, Ms. Kwade explores concepts of space, time, science and philosophy through sculpture, video and photography.
Her sculpture for the 57th Venice Biennale in 2017, “WeltenLinie (One in a Time),” featured rocks, a tree trunk and chairs surrounded by mirrors. (The New York Times described it as cinematic.) In Central Park in 2015, she created “Against the Run,” a 16-foot-tall version of the classic New York City street clock that simultaneously ran backward and forward, while still keeping time, a commission by the Public Art Fund.
