A Pentagon official says there has been no effect on command guidance after the president announced his nominee to be the next chairman.
“Trump ‘Accomplished the Military,’ He Says. But Experts Disagree” (news analysis, Feb. 10) asserts that the announcement of the nominee to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has “undermined the authority” of the current chairman, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., and “sown confusion about command guidance” throughout the military.
In fact, there has been no effect on General Dunford’s ability to perform his statutory duty of providing his military advice to the secretary of defense and the president.
Furthermore, the longstanding and proven process by which senior command guidance is communicated from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and military chains of command worldwide remains crystal clear and effective.
The writer, an Air Force colonel, is special assistant for public affairs to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
