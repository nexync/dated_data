Lisa Borders, the chief executive of Times Up, the Hollywood-led initiative to fight workplace sexual harassment, has resigned after less than four months on the job, representatives of the organization announced on Monday.
Borders, 61, who left her position as president of the WNBA in October to lead Times Up, resigned because of a family issue, according to a letter to the group’s stakeholders from Rebecca Goldman, Times Up’s chief operating officer. Goldman will act as interim chief executive while the group seeks a new leader.
Formed in response to the floods of women who stepped forward in late 2017 with tales of workplace sexual misconduct or worse, the Times Up initiative announced itself on Jan. 1, 2018, with such Hollywood heavyweights as Shonda Rhimes, Ava DuVernay, and Reese Witherspoon all vowing to fight systemic harassment, not just in high-profile professions, but at all levels. The group all but took over the 2018 Golden Globes, with women wearing black in protest, Oprah Winfrey championing their cause, and the actresses Meryl Streep, Amy Poehler and Emma Watson, among others, each bringing longtime activists onto the red carpet for interviews.
