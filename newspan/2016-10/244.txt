Video from an autonomous drone as it flew above a replica of a Middle Eastern village at a military testing range at Camp Edwards, in Massachusetts. Powered by advanced artificial intelligence software, the machine on its own was hunting for engineers armed with fake AK-47s who were pretending to be militants. The software powering the drone is part of a broader push by the Pentagon to marry artificial intelligence and weaponry, and transform warfare with thinking machines and brilliant computers.
