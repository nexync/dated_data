I would like to buy another full because I am afraid if we start allowing space between us now, we will begin an exponential pattern of ever-widening distance. But my wife wants a queen, citing my occasional sleepwalking/night terrors, which hardly happen anymore.
It’s adorable that you want to keep alive the magic of clutching your beloved at night and screaming. But as your marriage matures, you will learn that, apart from “special times,” ordinary co-sleeping is less about intimacy than it is the normalization of close farting. Being unconscious is a solitary act, and people need their space. All married couples who can afford it should have two villas, separated by a reflecting pool. Otherwise: a king-size bed.
