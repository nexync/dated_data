The chief executive of Rentboy.com, who led what federal authorities said was once the nation’s largest online male-escort service, pleaded guilty on Friday to promoting prostitution.
The chief executive, Jeffrey Hurant, 51, had been charged by federal prosecutors in Brooklyn in August 2015, along with six other people connected with the website. Rentboy.com was founded in 1997 and was stocked with escorts’ profiles listing various sexual services and fees. For prices that ranged from $59.95 to $299.95 a month, escorts advertised their “primary interests,” from “vanilla” (“nice and clean”) to “leather” to role playing to other fetishes.
Mr. Hurant faced a maximum of five years in prison, although, under his plea deal, he agreed not to appeal a potential sentence if it was no more than two years, and included a fine of $10 million or less.
Federal prosecutors dismissed the charges against Mr. Hurant’s employees, including his chief operating officer, a saleswoman and at least one escort. But the arrests prompted anger and protests by gay activists, both online and at the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, who said that the government had no right interfering in their sex lives.
The site is now shut down.
Mr. Hurant’s current lawyer, Michael Tremonte, did not return phone calls seeking comment.
