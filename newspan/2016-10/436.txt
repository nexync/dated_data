And Mr. Clapper said that if the United States imposed a no-fly zone or safe zone in parts of Syria where Russian and American warplanes are flying, he “wouldn’t put it past” the Russians to shoot down an American aircraft if they felt their forces were threatened.
Many of Mr. Clapper’s remarks, in a question-and-answer forum with Charlie Rose, were reiterations of what he and his associates have publicly said before. But his assessment of the situation on the Korean Peninsula appeared to diverge from a longstanding American policy: seeking North Korea’s return to the so-called six-party talks, suspended for years, which are aimed at verifiably ridding the country of nuclear weapons.
Tensions in the region have been rising. Disregarding international sanctions, North Korea has repeatedly tested nuclear bombs underground, as well as missiles that could theoretically carry warheads to the United States.
Over China’s objections, the United States intends to install a sophisticated antimissile system in South Korea to deter the perceived North Korean threat.
Asked later about Mr. Clapper’s remarks, the State Department spokesman, John Kirby, said at a regular news briefing in Washington that he had not seen them, but that the United States’ position on North Korea was unchanged.
“We want to see a return to the six-party talk process, and that means we need to see the North show a willingness and an ability to return to that process, which they haven’t done yet,” Mr. Kirby said.
