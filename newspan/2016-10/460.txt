A performer who can sell out a football stadium with the promise of delivering not much more than a stand-up comedy routine can safely be called “critic proof.” So I understand that my opinion of the comedy offered by Kevin Hart, who set a record for packing Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia in August 2015, where this concert movie was filmed, is likely to be immaterial. In any event, I thought about two-thirds of “Kevin Hart: What Now?” was pretty-to-very funny, and one third meh.
The movie, directed by Leslie Small and Tim Story, takes its title from his 2015 tour, and the question comes as a result of Mr. Hart’s having scaled certain heights of comedic and financial success. He opens his set by complaining about a threatening raccoon prowling around his secluded and no doubt ritzy new digs. His brash, energetic style deliberately masks a more timid (sometimes even cowardly) persona; his admissions of vulnerability generate the biggest laughs. (There’s actually a touch of Bob Hope in his work; both get a lot of mileage out of working a craven persona.) The verbal leitmotifs he establishes early on circle back into his anecdotes in surprising and satisfying ways. And his bit about his father using an iPhone is the only genuinely funny comedy about older people and technology that I’ve ever heard. There are frequent cut-aways to a diverse-looking audience eating it all up.
The movie is a good representation of Mr. Hart’s comedy, but not a perfect one; it’s bracketed by a goofy and lightweight (albeit star-studded) James Bond parody. If I were asked to offer one answer to the question posed by the movie’s title, I’d advise Mr. Hart to steer clear of such gratuitous indulgences in the future. But I don’t think I’m the person he’s asking.
“Kevin Hart: What Now?” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for (surprise!) raunchy language.
