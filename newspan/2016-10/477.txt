“This is a classic example of where Trump begins to demonstrate something he talks about all the time today, which is he’s a counterpuncher. So somebody comes after him and says that he’s done something nefarious and horrible, and he just goes back at them with all guns blazing — you know, boom, boom, boom. And admits nothing, never admit anything, never say you made a mistake, just keep coming.
This quotation comes from Tony Schwartz, the ghostwriter of Donald Trump’s book, “The Art of the Deal.” Schwartz is talking about Trump’s response to a 1970s lawsuit against his company for refusing to rent apartments to African-Americans.
But of course the description also applies to so much else — including Trump’s support for the Iraq War, his “birther” conspiracy theory, his refusal to release tax returns and, most recently, his history of sexual assault.
Over the past week, multiple women have come forward with stories of Trump’s kissing, touching and grabbing them against their will. Trump has responded by calling them liars and insulting them (even though he had previously bragged about precisely the behavior the women describe).
Keep in mind that all of the Frontline interviews took place before Trump’s sexual accusers came forward — and yet the descriptions capture Trump’s response to a T.
When Trump is feeling cornered, in business or politics, he has a go-to strategy: He lies, and he just keeps lying.
