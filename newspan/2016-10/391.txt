Just over a week ago, we learned that in 1995 Donald Trump “claimed almost a billion dollars in operating losses that could be used to avoid future federal income taxation.” On Sunday night during the presidential debate, he bragged about his tax expertise.
So let me just clear up something that should be obvious to most people. A net operating loss of $916 million in one year isn’t a good thing. This is true even if he was losing other people’s money. And it’s true even if it did “wipe out more than $50 million a year in taxable income over 18 years.” It doesn’t make Mr. Trump a genius.
But I bring it up here because this kind of talk does reflect the thinking I’ve seen countless people use to justify spending (or losing) money. They think it actually saves them money, and it just isn’t so.
No, you didn’t.  The reality is that you needed milk. You didn’t need (or want) a new bike until you figured out a story that let you “save” money while spending it.
I know this may sound like a simple and narrow point, but it’s shocking how often it trips up even the most money-savvy people.
So I want you to try uncoupling all of this. Learn to separate your buying decisions from your saving decisions. Do your civic duty, and work with your accountant to pay only your fair share of the taxes you owe. Buy the things you plan to buy. But no matter what the headlines say, please don’t believe that losing or spending your own money saves you money in the long run.
