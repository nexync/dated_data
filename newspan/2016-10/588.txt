The announcement on Thursday morning that Bob Dylan had been awarded the Nobel Prize for literature set off a firestorm of reaction on social media.
While fans of the musician celebrated, others debated whether a songwriter deserved a prize for literature.
Authors like Jodi Picoult (“My Sister’s Keeper”), who joked that she might now be eligible for a Grammy, Irvine Welsh (“Trainspotting”) and Hari Kunzru (“Gods Without Men”) weighed in on Twitter.
And some questioned whether Mr. Dylan could truly be considered a poet.
“From Orpheus to Faiz, song & poetry have been closely linked,” said Salman Rushdie, the Indian-born novelist also thought to have been a candidate for the prize.
The question of Mr. Dylan’s proper categorization has been debated for decades. One of the more recent considerations occurred in The New York Times in 2013, when the novelist and critic Francine Prose and the critic Dana Stevens discussed whether he was a musician or a poet.
She also noted that in the past, the capricious singer has rejected both labels.
In 1961, the critic Robert Shelton introduced the singer as someone who could transcend genre, calling him “both comedian and tragedian,” who, when taking his performance seriously, “seems to be performing in a slow-motion film.
Finally, in 2013, the music critic Bill Wyman made an unusual argument in The Times that Mr. Dylan was not only a poet, the singer’s “fierce and uncompromising” work also deserved the Nobel Prize for literature.
Mr. Wyman addressed potential arguments against the idea, most of them versions of the point that the singer was writing pop lyrics, not creating real poetry.
He finished with a final demand that Mr. Dylan be recognized.
