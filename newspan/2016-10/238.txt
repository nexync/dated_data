I also heard from women who are still trying to find the method that is right for them. One friend told me that she’d tried period suppression, but birth control pills made her feel too depressed. Another said she occasionally suppresses her period when she has work trips. And another friend, Suzy Piper, a 31-year-old who works in communications and lives in St. Paul, told me that she’s been trying different types of oral contraception to suppress her periods because of monthly migraines. The results, she said, have been mixed.
