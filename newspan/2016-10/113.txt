WASHINGTON — Documents released Monday in the Hillary Clinton email investigation show intense disagreement last year between the State Department and the F.B.I. over whether some of Mrs. Clinton’s emails should be considered classified, including a discussion of a possible “quid pro quo” to settle one dispute.
The new batch of documents indicated that in one particular case, a senior State Department official, Patrick F. Kennedy, pressed the F.B.I. to agree that one of Mrs. Clinton’s emails on the 2012 Benghazi attack would be unclassified — and not classified as the bureau wanted.
What remained unclear from the documents was whether it was Mr. Kennedy or an F.B.I. official who purportedly offered the “quid pro quo”: marking the email unclassified in exchange for the State Department’s approving the posting of more F.B.I. agents to Iraq.
Officials at both the F.B.I. and the State Department said Monday that no deal had been struck, or even offered, over the classification of Mrs. Clinton’s private emails. They noted that the Benghazi email in question had been made public with a sentence blocked out, meeting the F.B.I.’s demand for classification. They also said no additional F.B.I. agents had been posted overseas.
There is no indication from the documents that Mrs. Clinton was aware of the discussion.
The F.B.I.’s latest release of 100 pages of internal investigative files prolonged the intense public scrutiny of Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of state, which has been perhaps more damaging to her presidential campaign than any other issue.
The new documents also cast particular attention on the role of Mr. Kennedy, a State Department civil servant for more than four decades, in working to oversee the review and public release of tens of thousands of Mrs. Clinton’s private emails.
Mr. Kennedy was part of a long-running battle between the State Department and the intelligence agencies over Mrs. Clinton’s emails. As the emails were prepared for release, officials from the intelligence agencies argued in some cases that information in them should have been marked classified, while State Department officials countered that they contained the routine business of American diplomacy. State Department officials, who argue that the intelligence agencies are overzealous in classifying information, remain sensitive to criticism that they were sloppy in handling the material.
The F.B.I. on Monday released 100 pages of internal records from its investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, including summaries of its interviews with witnesses.
The F.B.I. had deemed the email classified, but the State Department disagreed.
The employee told investigators that “in exchange for marking the email unclassified, State would reciprocate by allowing the F.B.I. to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden,” according to the F.B.I.’s summary of the employee’s questioning by investigators.
A second F.B.I. interview included in the documents provides a somewhat different version of the dispute over the classification of the Benghazi email, with the suggestion that the F.B.I. — and not Mr. Kennedy — had offered to make a deal.
The email they were struggling over was sent on Nov. 18, 2012, by William V. Roebuck, who oversaw the department’s office for North Africa and is now the American ambassador to Bahrain.
In it, he notified five other officials of the arrest of “several people” in Libya on suspicion they were connected with the Benghazi attack two months earlier. It was subsequently forwarded to senior officials at the department and then to Mrs. Clinton on her private email account by her deputy chief of staff, Jake Sullivan, with a short “f.y.i.” note.
Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, said that no favors had been exchanged in the discussions of Mrs. Clinton’s emails, and that there had been no change in the number of agents in Iraq as a result of the conversations. “The allegation of any kind of quid pro quo is inaccurate and does not align with the facts,” Mr. Toner said.
The F.B.I. also said there was “never a quid pro quo,” but it said the accusations had been referred to the bureau’s inspection division, which handles internal ethics issues, to investigate. The F.B.I. official who discussed the issue with Mr. Kennedy has since left the bureau, an official said.
Two prominent members of the House — Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Devin Nunes of California, the chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence — called on Secretary of State John Kerry to relieve Mr. Kennedy of his position pending an investigation.
In a letter to Mr. Kerry, they accused Mr. Kennedy, the State Department and the F.B.I. of collusion. They charged that the State Department had altered its normal process in reviewing Mrs. Clinton’s emails, consulting directly with the Justice Department and bypassing the F.B.I.’s input. A spokesman for Mr. Trump’s campaign, Jason Miller, said Mr. Kennedy should resign.
Mr. Toner said Mr. Kennedy would remain in his position with the full support of Mr. Kerry.
After the email issue emerged in March 2015, Mrs. Clinton insisted for months that she had never sent or received emails that contained classified information. But she was forced to backtrack, as the F.B.I. concluded this summer that at least 110 emails had contained classified information, even if they had not been marked as such at the time.
