“The reason we don’t have a band name is just because we never expected it to pop like it did!” explains the musician and actor Brian “Sene” Marc. So when he makes R&B with the vocalist Denitia Odigie, they simply go by their names: Denitia and Sene.
Since the release of the first album, Marc’s film career has begun to take off, too: In just the past few months, he’s appeared both in the social-media-era thriller “Nerve,” alongside Emma Roberts, and in a lead role in the controversial festival-circuit favorite “White Girl.” It’s not a coincidence that he’s begun to take the reins in directing Denitia and Sene’s videos — starting with the hazy, memory-inflected visual for the moody, sensual earworm “Open Wide,” which premieres here and was shot near Odigie’s home in the Rockaways.
