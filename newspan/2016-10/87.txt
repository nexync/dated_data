Andrew Lloyd Webber, the storied musical theater mogul, has hired the Broadway producer Ken Davenport to oversee his resurgent North American presence.
Mr. Davenport was most recently represented on Broadway as the lead producer of the Deaf West Theater revival of “Spring Awakening.” He is also known for his entrepreneurialism — he has a podcast and a blog about Broadway, and he operates a commercial Off Broadway theater.
“Andrew Lloyd Webber has been an inspiration to me for a very long time, and the idea of working alongside his organization is a thrill,” Mr. Davenport said.
