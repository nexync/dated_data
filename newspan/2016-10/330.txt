Indio, Calif. — On Friday at Desert Trip, ahead of opening night sets by Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, good vibes wafted across the expansive Empire Polo Club here.
With crowds of about 75,000 a day expected, the event still managed the warmth of an eclectic, oversize family reunion, as fans of classic rock vibrated in anticipation of the three-day concert, also featuring Paul McCartney, Neil Young, the Who and Roger Waters.
Playing to a baby boomer base not exactly interested in roughing it, the grounds were immaculate for a music festival, with plentiful space and shade and minimal lines for drinks, celebrity-chef branded sustenance and functional toilets. The bands even started on time.
More in line with most festivals: Before the show came the peacocking. Attendees from across the world brought out their rarest concert tees, their least faded tie-dye and, in some cases, full-tilt superfan regalia as symbols of unity with their fellow travelers. Nostalgia was not being avoided, but embraced.
Below, some of the more colorful attendees share their stories.
“I haven’t been outside of Australia before,” Mr. Marshall said. “This was too good an opportunity to pass up. We’ll check out Disneyland and Universal Studios while we’re here,” he added, gesturing to his daughter.
“I should’ve had my Trump hat on — it’s back at the house,” said Mr. Haring, who acknowledged that his political leanings might put him out of step with the Desert Trip crowd.
As for the overwhelmingly older crowd, “I guess people our age don’t appreciate this music as much as I thought they would,” Ms. Sokol said.
“I’m here for Dylan because I wanted to become familiar with his music,” said Ms. Heidt, who elected to attend only the first night. “This is a bucket list thing for me, because I have never, ever gone to a concert like this before.
She trailed off, and then drew a square in the air with her fingers.
