Little Lord: Now Is The Time. Now Is The Best Time. Now Is The Best Time Of Your Life.
 Try gnomes. Five of them are in “Now Is the Time. Now Is the Best Time. Now Is the Best Time of Your Life.,” and they pop up from hidden recesses onstage, staring at the audience from behind bushy beards and plastic facial masks. When they creepily whisper-sing, “Have you seen the ghost of Tom/ Long white bones with the flesh all gone/ Wouldn’t it be chilly with no skin on?” you know Halloween has come early.
It’s a little unclear what the pointy-hatted creatures are up to, but this new production from the Little Lord company doesn’t traffic in narrative intelligibility. And yet the show has an odd, ramshackle charm.
As in previous Little Lord pieces, such as last year’s “Bambi______/Kaffeehaus” (the full title won’t appear here) and 2013’s “Pocahontas, and/or America,” various eras are thrown into a blender turned up to high.
The man speaking is Diedrich Knickerbocker (Mr. Levinton, who also directed), Irving’s fictional alter ego and the narrator of “Rip Van Winkle.” He wanders about Peiyi Wong’s set, which looks like a home on “Hoarders” right before the cleanup. Yellowing papers crammed into mail slots, broken chandeliers and busted calculators, an ancient slide projector and more lay in seemingly haphazard fashion, and provide nifty hiding places for those “odd-looking personages” of Irving’s story. They dance the mambo, strike poses against red lighting and hang out with Rip (the wonderful Lisa Rafaela Clair), whom you half expect to plead, “Take my gnome, please!” — there are many nods to borscht belt jokes.
“I gift to you a link to the past, a grounding for the present, a reason for the future,” Knickerbocker grandiosely announces, and the show mixes them all together. It’s hard to make sense of it, but also hard to dislike.
