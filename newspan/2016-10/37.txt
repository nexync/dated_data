The painting, a cover for The Saturday Evening Post, was inspired by the hotly contested presidential race between an ailing Franklin D. Roosevelt and Thomas E. Dewey, the Republican governor of New York. It shows a befuddled Everyman at a voting booth who, despite having educated himself with newspapers and pamphlets, still can’t make a decision.
“Which One?” will be on public view for the first time beginning Nov. 4 in an exhibition at Sotheby’s ahead of its American art auction on Nov. 21. The painting is expected to fetch $4 million to $6 million.
Rockwell’s painting is particularly accomplished for its level of detail and thorough storytelling, Ms. Sterling said. She pointed to the subject’s face, which she said contained clearly articulated humor, but also a universal message of indecision.
“He was such a great study of character,” Ms. Sterling said of Rockwell.
The painting comes from the estate of Ogden Mills Phipps, the horse racing executive and breeder who acquired it in 1985. (He died in April.) Rockwell’s works have sold for a broad range of prices; the highest was at a Sotheby’s auction in 2013, when the painting “Saying Grace” (1951) fetched more than $46 million — far beyond its estimate of $15 million to $20 million.
