“The Dangers of Misreading a Crime Report” (editorial, Sept. 29) doesn’t mention one additional problem with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Annual Crime Report. Despite its title, the report does not present information about actual crime, only about crimes reported to the police.
Because many people don’t report it when they have been victimized, and because in the past many police departments suppressed the reports they did receive, research shows that reported property crime is in many cases very different from actual crime.
But murder rates may be more accurate than property crime rates because murder cases usually involve finding a body.
