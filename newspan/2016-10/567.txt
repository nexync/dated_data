And true to its title, “In the Shadow of Women” throws the handsome, pouty Pierre — played by Stanislas Merhar — into a state of semipermanent eclipse. As Manon, Clotilde Courau is intriguingly open and complicated, a woman whose belief in her own honesty blinds her both to her husband’s lapses and her own capacity for deceit. Lena Paugam, as Elisabeth, has a simpler, smaller role: She is available and needy, but not quite comfortable with her dependence on the scraps of attention Pierre gives her. Mr. Garrel is especially attentive to the women’s faces, as if he could find clues to character in their physiognomy.
