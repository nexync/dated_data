Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia was on the attack from the start, declaring that “the thought of Donald Trump as commander in chief scares us to death.” Mr. Pence, cool and coherent where Mr. Trump, in his debate with Hillary Clinton last week, was petulant and erratic, made his own strategy clear right away: He set out to invent a new version of Donald Trump, one that he could believe in.
Mr. Pence, who describes himself as a Christian conservative, knows that Mr. Trump, who changed his political party affiliation five times between 1999 and 2012, is no ideological soul mate. Mr. Pence issued a shaky endorsement of his fellow conservative Ted Cruz during the primaries. But Mr. Pence has his own political aspirations and abandoned his re-election bid for governor to sign on with Mr. Trump when he was surging.
Mr. Pence was far more successful than Mr. Trump last week in taking the fight to his opponent. Mr. Kaine occasionally struggled to make the best case for Mrs. Clinton, interrupting repeatedly and resorting to canned lines that Mr. Pence mocked with the pained expression that he wore when he wasn’t smirking or shaking his head.
A strong moment for both candidates came when they turned to the question of abortion, an issue that has been largely absent from this campaign. Both men are personally opposed to abortion, but Mr. Kaine supports a woman’s right to make the choice for herself. Their discussion showed that their respective positions were deeply felt and carefully considered. It offered a rare glimpse of politicians intelligently exploring a fraught question — and also revealed how determined Mr. Pence is to roll back abortion rights.
