After months of being told that America was “going in the wrong direction,” I was gratified to read Paul Krugman’s Gallup report that debunked the idea.
Additional proof is the large number of Americans who are buying homes, autos, appliances and electronic gadgets as soon as they are introduced. A smaller number, taking advantage of low airfares, are going on vacations that couldn’t be afforded in the past.
This leads me to believe that conservatives fear that history will rate the Obama years more prosperous than the Reagan ones.
Anyone who claims otherwise is merely mindlessly parroting nonsense and refusing to acknowledge reality.
