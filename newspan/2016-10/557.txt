There was a too-eager invocation of “Trumped-up trickle-down economics”; a repeated, awkward pronunciation of China; some audible sniffling and a vehement complaint of a broken microphone; a plea to call Sean Hannity; and a gleeful shoulder shimmy.
Yes, to kick off its 42nd season, “Saturday Night Live,” the NBC sketch comedy institution, opened with a parody of the first presidential debate, pitting Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton against Alec Baldwin as Donald J. Trump, and Michael Che as the baffled, deadpan moderator, Lester Holt.
This eagerly awaited sketch, which opened the show on Saturday (and which NBC had been promoting during the week as if it were a championship prize fight) mixed some of the real-life zingers and gaffes from Monday’s debate with the show’s own satirical takes on the political showdown.
This year, anticipation for the debate parody seemed to run especially high, following the face-off on Monday between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton at Hofstra University, which drew an estimated 84 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
“Saturday Night Live” is also facing the question of whether it can have any satirical bite on Mr. Trump, who was a controversial choice to host the program in November 2015.
Nonetheless, Mr. Trump has continued to appear on NBC entertainment programs including “S.N.L.” and “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” whose host was roundly criticized for conducting a chummy interview with Mr. Trump in September.
In Saturday’s season premiere, “S.N.L.” seemed to play it down the middle, balancing each joke about Mr. Trump with a zinger about Mrs. Clinton.
Other election-themed sketches included a political edition of the game show “Family Feud,” in which members of the Trump family (and Vladimir V. Putin) competed against Mrs. Clinton’s allies, including Bernie Sanders (played by the frequent “S.N.L.” guest star Larry David).
