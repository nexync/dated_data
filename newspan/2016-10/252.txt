LONDON — Blame the caterer.
The British Museum on Thursday confirmed a report that emerged this week that a catering company worker had knocked the thumb off the Townley Venus, a roughly 2,000-year-old Roman marble statue at the museum.
The incident took place “shortly before 6 p.m.” on Dec. 10 last year, as caterers set up for a corporate event, a spokeswoman for the museum said via email.
The British Museum contains a breathtaking collection of over 8 million objects that paint an interconnected portrait of the world’s cultures. You could spend a week here, but we’ll guide you through.
Trustees had been informed of the incident, but the news was not made public until this week, when The Art Newspaper reported on it.
The statue was also damaged and then fixed in 2012, when a visitor knocked off part of its hand.
The statue has been fixed, and stayed on public display while repairs were done when the museum was closed.
