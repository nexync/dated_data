As the vice dean of Bhutan’s first law school, the American, Michael Peil, has been doing a lot of explaining lately. Draped in the country’s national dress, Mr. Peil and a Bhutanese colleague have spent the better part of six weeks traversing this Buddhist kingdom armed with fliers and a PowerPoint presentation.
For many students here in this western village, it was the first they had heard of plans to open the Jigme Singye Wangchuck School of Law, which will admit its inaugural class of about 25 students next spring for instruction at a temporary campus in Thimphu, the capital. A permanent campus is being built in Paro, to the west.
After each recruiting session, students too shy to voice their concerns aloud have whispered dozens of questions in Mr. Peil’s ear.
Will the admissions process discriminate against the poor? What does “justice delayed is justice denied” mean? And most urgently, can students with tattoos apply?
