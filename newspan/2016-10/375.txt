As The New York Times Company transforms for the digital age, it has moved more into lifestyle journalism, with online products like Cooking, Watching and Well. Now, it has made another bet on so-called service journalism, with the acquisition of the product recommendation site The Wirecutter and its sibling, The Sweethome.
The all-cash transaction closed on Monday. The deal is worth slightly more than $30 million, according to a person with knowledge of the acquisition who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Founded in 2011 by Brian Lam, a technology journalist and former editor of Gawker Mediaâ€™s technology site, Gizmodo, The Wirecutter provides recommendations for gadgets and electronics like televisions and headphones. (The Sweethome focuses mostly on products for the home.) The site started publishing as part of The Awl network, whose founders included Choire Sicha and Alex Balk, both formerly of Gawker Media, with the idea that it would delve deeply into categories of products rather than post more frequently.
The New York Times and The Wirecutter already have an editorial partnership, which began about a year ago. The companies have collaborated on stories about bad Wi-Fi, poor battery life and cord-cutting. Brian X. Chen, a consumer technology reporter for The Times who worked on those articles, helped Mr. Lam start The Wirecutter when he was between jobs in 2011.
The acquisition comes at a time of transition for The Times, which is attempting to reconstitute itself for the digital future, a process that has the newsroom bracing for layoffs early next year.
