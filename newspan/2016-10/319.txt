Ever since the Frick Collection yielded to public protest and abandoned plans for a six-story addition last year, curiosity has mounted as to how that museum would revise its renovation plans.
Now the Frick has taken the first step in that direction. On Thursday, the board approved the selection of Annabelle Selldorf’s architecture firm, whose projects have included the Neue Galerie in Manhattan and the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass.
“She’s somebody who has a clear vision of respect for historical buildings but at the same time has a clean, elegant, modernist aesthetic that is very much about welcoming visitors today,” said Ian Wardropper, the Frick’s director.
In coming up with a new design, Ms. Selldorf has been charged with improving circulation in the Frick’s galleries, library and public spaces, while maintaining the museum’s existing footprint and preserving its jewel-box character. A late Gilded Age mansion, it was designed from 1912-14 by Thomas Hastings for the industrialist Henry Clay Frick.
Over the last 18 months, the Frick evaluated a wide pool of architects, inviting 20 to submit proposals before deciding on Ms. Selldorf.
She replaces Davis Brody Bond, a firm whose design would have eliminated a gated garden on East 70th Street, designed by the British landscape architect Russell Page. That design also called for opening the museum’s private upstairs rooms to the public and offered views of Central Park from a new roof garden.
That plan was roundly criticized by architects, neighbors and critics, as well as three former commissioners of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.
While she is aware of the controversy that accompanied this project the last time around, Ms. Selldorf said that the previous architectural plans did not figure into her proposal and that she has not seen them.
