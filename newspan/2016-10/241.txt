The basic structure of the Affordable Care Act looked promising to private insurers. The government, in effect, required consumers to buy their products and provided subsidies to help defray the cost, under an arrangement that had few precedents in other industries.
A public option could take market share from private insurers, so it is no surprise they would oppose it. But insurers say the public option would not hold down medical costs, which they describe as the main engine driving up premiums. Moreover, insurers say that the government would have an unfair advantage if it both regulates and competes with private plans.
For some people, the subsidies have proved inadequate. People with annual incomes less than two and half times the poverty level (less than $29,700 for an individual) receive the most generous subsidies and have signed up in large numbers.
But enrollment figures suggest that higher-income people who receive smaller subsidies or none at all have not seen insurance as such a bargain.
“The insurance exchanges have enrolled more than 80 percent of the potential exchange population with incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level,” said Caroline F. Pearson, a senior vice president of Avalere, a health policy consulting company. But, she added, they have enrolled only 17 percent of potential customers with incomes from three to four times the poverty level ($35,640 to $47,520 for an individual).
