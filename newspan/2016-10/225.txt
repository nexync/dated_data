The saga of Bob Dylan and the Nobel Prize continues.
Mr. Dylan became the first musician to win the Nobel Prize in Literature this month, setting off a debate about whether song lyrics had the same artistic value as novels and poetry. But no one knows how Mr. Dylan feels about the honor. He has made no public statements, and a brief reference added to his website (“Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature”) was quickly removed after the news media caught wind of it.
After Mr. Dylan’s 2016 Nobel Prize was announced, Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said she did not know if Mr. Dylan would attend the award ceremony in December because she had not been able to get in touch with him. Mr. Wastberg told the newspaper that the committee would not try to contact him again.
The Swedish Academy moved quickly on Saturday to distance itself from Mr. Wastberg’s remarks. Ms. Danius said in a statement that every person awarded a Nobel Prize can make his or her own decision about how to respond.
Mr. Wastberg’s criticisms, however, were met with amusement — some of it bitter. Some cheered the spectacle of a musical icon thumbing his nose at the Nobel Prize, while others seemed to share Mr. Wastberg’s frustration with a musician known for his aloofness. Mr. Dylan rarely gives interviews or interacts with audiences at concerts.
James Wolcott, a columnist for Vanity Fair, noted that Mr. Dylan’s lack of response was not the same as actively turning down the prize as some laureates, like Jean Paul Sartre, have done. Mr. Wolcott said it was a mistake to celebrate the musician’s reticence.
When the award was announced, some in the literary world criticized the decision to give it to one of the 20th century’s most well-known musicians. Those early murmurs of dissent have only grown amid Mr. Dylan’s apparent indifference to an honor that can transform the career of a lesser-known writer.
