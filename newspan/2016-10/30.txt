“Rezoning Proposal for a City Elementary School Draws Anger From All Sides” (news article, Sept. 30) lays out the stiff resistance to any change in school zone lines in the district I represent, even when it means alleviating severe overcrowding. New York City has one of the most segregated school systems in the country, and there can be no more excuses to avoid focusing on integration.
In my mind, diversity itself provides an invaluable education. In fact, study after study finds that integrated schools are optimal for children of all economic and racial backgrounds. Research shows that diverse schools decrease the education gap and that test scores go up for everyone.
This district has voices for diversity, but they have been drowned out among the cries of some Upper West Side families and some elected officials who refuse to hear the call for social and educational progress.
Leadership — from the Department of Education, the School District 3 Community Education Council and elected officials — is not about hearing just the loudest voices in the room but about critically evaluating and standing up for what is in the best interest of the long-term educational health of our community as a whole.
