Climate science reached an unhappy milestone last week. And then things went a little crazy.
Because rising amounts of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping gas, in the atmosphere have been linked to climate change, scientists suggest that rising above 400 parts per million line makes it even harder to prevent global temperatures from rising beyond the goal of two degrees Celsius agreed to in Paris. It has been millions of years since atmospheric levels of CO2 have risen so high.
In recent years, monitoring stations have reported periods in which CO2 had climbed above 400 parts per million, but the new announcement from Scripps suggested that the line has probably been passed for good.
That is sobering news. But some of the reaction has been, to put it mildly, crazed. Vice Motherboard, for example, screamed: “Goodbye World: We’ve Passed the Carbon Tipping Point for Good.” Ralph Keeling, a professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and director of the Scripps CO2 program, wrote the blog post announcing the news, and seems a bit taken aback by such apocalyptic headlines.
Gavin Schmidt, a scientist who heads a NASA climate research unit in New York, agreed. “400 ppm is definitely a milestone, but there’s no evidence it’s a tipping point,” he wrote in an email response to questions.
