With polls showing him sliding nationally, Donald J. Trump received a bit of welcome news on Sunday in one battleground state as the editorial page of Nevada’s largest newspaper, The Las Vegas Review-Journal, endorsed him for president.
It is the first major newspaper to give Mr. Trump its blessing, though it may come with something of an asterisk: The Review-Journal was bought late last year by the casino magnate and billionaire Sheldon Adelson, a Trump supporter and longtime Republican benefactor.
The editorial described Mr. Trump as flawed but nonetheless preferable to Hillary Clinton.
The endorsement comes at a time when Mr. Trump is in growing need of support: An ABC News tracking poll released on Sunday showed Mrs. Clinton beating him nationally by 12 percentage points.
Mrs. Clinton has stacked up newspaper endorsements, including from unlikely quarters: The Arizona Republic broke with longstanding tradition and made her the first Democrat its editorial page has ever endorsed. The Dallas Morning News editorial page gave her its first endorsement of a Democrat since 1940. And The Cincinnati Enquirer, whose editorial page also endorsed Mrs. Clinton, said that the last Democrat to receive its endorsement was Woodrow Wilson.
Until Sunday, the biggest newspapers to endorse Mr. Trump were the Santa Barbara, Calif., News-Press and St. Joseph, Mo., News-Press.
The Review-Journal’s editorial page rejected what it suggested was overwrought fear-mongering about Mr. Trump.
