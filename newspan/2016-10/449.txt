Imagine if you could put on radio goggles to see the clouds of energy billowing from quasars or the lighthouse blasts from pulsars. Or X-ray visors to see the spitfire from black holes.
Most of the wonders of the universe are invisible to us without technological help. Visible light rays, after all, are only a small slice of natureâ€™s repertoire of electromagnetic radiation, which ranges from tiny high-energy bites of energy called gamma rays to the long, slow, booming rise and swell of radio waves.
Astronomers from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, in Perth in Western Australia, have produced what they call the Gleamoscope to dial up visions of the night sky over Australia in whatever kind of light you prefer.
Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, dominates every frame as an edge-on band of energy. But using the slider, a viewer can choose to see the dull red glow of hydrogen gas throughout space, the twinkling stars and dust clouds of the visible galaxy, the superhot gas vibrating X-rays, the warm infrared glow of dust clouds and even the spotty, glowing remnants of the Big Bang itself, manifesting as microwave radiation.
