TUESDAY PUZZLE — If you wind up with a bad case of earworm after you finish solving today’s puzzle by Sam “Not the Newsman” Donaldson and Doug Peterson, you have only them to blame. I solved their puzzle fairly swiftly, but came away with the song “CHEESE SO FINE” stuck in my head. And now I can’t get it out and all I want is cheese on a fancy cracker.
 If you can get IPHONES for 10D (“Products featuring Siri”), and you know that you have a four-letter word beginning with “I,” it’s easy enough to extrapolate that the answer must be IKEA.
• 16A and 7D: Did you confidently plunk down PERU at 7D, “Lima’s home”? Not today. Today, PERU belongs at 16A and 7D is where you can fill in Lima’s other home, OHIO.
• 25A: “Pressing business?” could refer to business you have to attend to immediately. It also, if you’ve guessed that this clue is a misdirection from the question mark, could have something to do with ironing. But today, it has to do with pressing grapes, and the answer is WINERY.
• 38A: More misdirection! “Rag covered in dirt?” is not a SHAMWOW. It’s a TABLOID.
• 55A: I loved this clue. “Flying circus performer?” is, sadly, not a reference to Monty Python, nor does it refer to a performer who flies on the trapeze. Today we’re supposed to be thinking about a FLEA circus.
• 61D and 62D: If you don’t solve in numerical clue order, this might have been a bit confusing. “Aries animals” are RAMS, and the “God who sounds like he was mentioned in the preceding clue” would be ARES, the Greek god of war.
Doug Peterson: Sam came up with the theme concept and we tossed quite a few potential entries back and forth.
Sam Donaldson: The “add-a-sound” gimmick isn’t novel, so the challenge here was in the details. We wanted theme entries that were fun and we also wanted some added elegance in making sure the “H” to “CH” switch changed the spelling of the original word in the base phrase.
Sam Donaldson: Yeah, “Symbol on an X-rated slot machine” is about the cleanest clue I can come up with here that isn’t a total snooze-fest.
Doug Peterson: And don’t miss the shout-out to Sam in the clue for ZILLION. He debuted GINORMOUS in a Saturday puzzle in 2010, and you should use the word “ginormous” as often as you can. I’m sure the SHAMWOW guy would agree.
Sam Donaldson: Speaking of SHAMWOW, Doug composed the grid and, as usual, it just sparkles. I would have tried to get DIRTY CHERRY in the middle but no doubt the non-thematic fill would have suffered. Doug smartly decided to stick with four theme answers, and the result is much crisper. This is one of the many reasons why it’s so much fun to work with Doug.
