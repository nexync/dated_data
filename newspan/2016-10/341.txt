Donald Trump’s candidacy has left many Republicans yearning for a deus ex machina in this presidential race, but Evan McMullin is not it. He doesn’t have the money or the name recognition, and he is on the ballot in only 11 states.
A former C.I.A. officer and Republican congressional adviser, Mr. McMullin entered the presidential race two months ago, because, he said, Mr. Trump’s nomination as the Republican Party’s standard-bearer appalled him.
Mr. McMullin is a smart, affable, traditional conservative whose suspicion of the federal government mirrors public views in Utah. More than half of Utah’s voters, including Mr. McMullin himself, are Mormon, a religious minority particularly offended by Mr. Trump’s proposed ban of Muslim immigrants.
Mr. Trump’s nomination had forced many Utah Republicans to consider not voting for the first time in their lives.
No wonder that, as Mr. McMullin tools around Salt Lake City, “people come up and they just thank us for running, in a relieved sort of way,” he told The Times.
Most Americans may go to the polls on Nov. 8 not knowing who Evan McMullin is. But that doesn’t seem to bother the people of Utah.
