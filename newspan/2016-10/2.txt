The Atlantic said on Tuesday that it had named Jeffrey Goldberg, a correspondent for the company since 2007, its next editor in chief, drawing an extensive search to a close.
The role had been vacant since the end of April, when James Bennet left the magazine to rejoin The New York Times as its editorial page editor. David G. Bradley, the chairman of Atlantic Media, received nearly 500 recommendations for the position, and he and Bob Cohn, president of The Atlantic, considered several dozen candidates.
Still, Mr. Goldberg, 51, who was last an editor when he was in college at the University of Pennsylvania in the mid-1980s, said he had not expected to become The Atlantic’s top editor.
Mr. Goldberg takes the reins of The Atlantic’s editorial operations as the magazine publisher continues to transform into a multimedia company. The company’s online audience has been on an upward trajectory — in August, the company drew 19 million unique online visitors in the United States, a roughly 50 percent increase from August 2015, according to the measurement firm comScore. Magazine sales have also remained strong, with a total circulation of roughly 500,000 over the last several years, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. The company said it expected its total revenue to increase 20 percent this year.
