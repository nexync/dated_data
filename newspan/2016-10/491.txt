That means changing attitudes that equate mental illness with weakness. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, said in a speech this week that some veterans returning from war “can’t handle” the stress. Mr. Trump was arguing for mental health services, but the remark drew scorn from veterans’ groups that work to reduce the stigma. Mr. Trump’s campaign has said his remarks were taken out of context. A spokesman for General Bolduc declined to comment.
Gen. Joseph L. Votel, then the head of the United States Special Operations Command, spoke to CNN last spring about ending the stigma tied to seeking treatment. “It is absolutely normal and expected that you will ask for help,” he said.
When commanders rented a movie theater last year for a screening of the latest “Star Wars” movie, General Bolduc made sure that the free tickets had to be picked up at the center, to get soldiers comfortable with stepping inside the door.
A native of Laconia, N.H., General Bolduc said he had wanted to join the Special Forces ever since as a young boy he watched the movie “The Green Berets” with his grandfather.
“He’s Captain America,” said Lt. Col. Nathan Broshear, a spokesman for Special Operations Command Africa.
