A photograph on the pamphlet extolling the benefits of emigration features women in red swimsuits, skidding on water skis across Sydney Harbor — a jarring contrast to the bleak circumstances of a British couple named Charlotte and Henry in their mold-afflicted, too-small house in Cambridge. It’s so cold outside that the cows have steam rising from their flanks, and Charlotte, suffering from a debilitating postpartum depression while caring for a 7-month-old, has just discovered that she is, again, pregnant.
Its lush and absorbing framework notwithstanding, this is a novel with plot points driven almost exclusively by a woman’s grim struggle with depression in an era — or at least in circumstances — that afford little help. “Home is a secret world that closes its door in your absence and never lets you find it again,” Charlotte observes, as she writes in her diary toward the novel’s denouement. Is this a sentiment the novel really intends to convey or is it the bleak assessment of an overwhelmed mind? Bishop is too skillful a writer to provide a simple answer.
