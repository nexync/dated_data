Let’s begin the week talking about endings.
“It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish” is a well-worn sports cliché that’s timely right now for baseball fans. Today is the eve of the World Series between the Chicago Cubs and the Cleveland Indians.
Both teams rely heavily on their closers, the pitchers who enter in a game’s final inning. For the Cubs, it’s Aroldis Chapman. Cody Allen is used to lock down games for the Indians.
Their specialty: protecting their team’s leads by shutting down opposing batters with high-velocity throws. Chapman, who is Cuban, frequently reaches 100 miles per hour.
In Spanish, he might be called “el cerrador.” A South Korean reliever in the major leagues was known as “The Final Boss” while playing in Asia.
Michelle Obama has been called “The Closer,” too, for her powerful speeches during the final weeks of presidential campaigns. And Alec Baldwin riffed on the word in “Glengarry Glen Ross,” commanding a group of salesmen to “always be closing” in a profane tirade.
The Indians know what happens to those who can’t.
They were three outs from winning the 1997 World Series, but their closer blew a 2-1 lead to the Florida Marlins in the deciding game. Cleveland lost in extra innings.
