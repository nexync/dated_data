The daily fantasy sports companies DraftKings and FanDuel have each agreed to each pay $6 million to the New York attorney general’s office to settle claims that they employed false and deceptive advertising practices.
The attorney general’s investigation found that the companies had misled novice players about the substantial advantages that high-volume professional players had, including their use of automated computer scripts and sophisticated statistical and game-theory strategies. The companies also misled players about the likelihood that they would earn a positive return, the investigation found; most players lost money over time.
The settlements clear the way for the two companies to merge. DraftKings and FanDuel are so short of cash, two people familiar with their negotiations said, that they asked Mr. Schneiderman’s office if they could pay the settlement in installments and conceded that they were having difficulty meeting their day-to-day obligations.
FanDuel, which is based in New York, has laid off more than 60 people, and both companies have acknowledged that they are months behind in their payments to vendors, especially to the array of public-relations and lobbying firms that they have employed across the nation to persuade state legislatures to legalize daily fantasy games — the most critical component in rebuilding their business.
“As previously stated, the negotiations were tough but fair, but we are very pleased to have reached a resolution as this allows us to focus on our busiest time of year with N.F.L., N.H.L. and soccer in full swing and N.B.A. season starting tonight,” the FanDuel spokeswoman Justine Sacco said.
