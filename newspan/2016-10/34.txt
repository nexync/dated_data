At the beginning of the Renaissance, in the 16th century, aristocrats and scholars began to fill rooms with exotic artifacts from far-flung territories — horns said to have belonged to unicorns, brilliant red coral, animal skeletons, chalices made of silver or coconut shells — often displayed among Old Master paintings and sculptures. Over time, the practice of collecting items for one’s “wunderkammer” (“cabinet of wonders”) became more and more elaborate. Kings would gift extraordinary objects to other rulers to impress them with their wealth, such as a windup automaton that poured wine or a boat carved of gold and set with hundreds of precious stones. Perhaps one of the world’s greatest collections, which still exists, is the Green Vault, the treasure chamber of August the Strong, which reopened to the public in Dresden in 2004 and contains thousands of objects, from a cherry stone carved with over a hundred faces to the largest green-hued diamond in the world.
Below, Laue shares a few key destinations for wunderkammer enthusiasts around the world.
