Review: In ‘The Loon,’ the Birds Can Coo. Can You?
“The Loon,” a new piece from Witness Relocation, is dance theater, not musical theater, but it has a kind of overture anyway. As the audience filters in, calming classical music plays over speakers, underscoring a video on the large upstage screen. We glimpse its images only partly, inside letters spelling out the name of the show, but what we see there is nature: woodland and whatnot. Every so often, a female GPS voice provides a new instruction, lulling us deeper into the countryside.
Much more drably attired is the respectable-looking bearded man downstage, all buttoned up in his three-piece suit. Speaking to us of time and memory, autumn and decay, he is given to a certain unadorned drama.
Based partly on “Voices of the Loon,” an Audubon Society recording from 1980, “The Loon” is the kind of show that makes you wonder how differently it would register if you’d inhaled a little deeper when you walked past the guys getting high on your way to the theater. That doesn’t mean it’s messy — it’s not — but it is unafraid of its own strangeness.
There’s a comic horror to its brief, stylized sitcom scenes of suburban domestic life, while its take on love and romance is more bittersweet. A high school dance to “A Whiter Shade of Pale,” under a revolving disco ball, is overtly charming. And Mr. Johanson, who wrote the text he speaks, is a benign and amusing presence, talking of social rituals both avian and human. His loon calls, when at last he does them, are deadpan-hilarious.
Yet a longing suffuses this show, a solitude shadowed by the awareness of mortality.
True or false? Look at him, tamped down in that suit. Then look at the loons, reveling together, loose and free.
