But in January, the new general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, an appointee of President Trump, was granted a 60-day stay in the case to negotiate a settlement with the company, even though the trial was only days from concluding.
Judge Esposito argued that a legitimate settlement must at least approach the effectiveness of a remedy resulting from a finding against the company. She said McDonald’s refused even to guarantee that its franchisees would abide by the terms.
McDonald’s and Mr. Robb’s office must now decide whether to abandon the settlement approach and resume the trial; try again on a new settlement agreement; or, most likely, appeal the decision to the National Labor Relations Board, where Republicans hold a majority.
In her decision, Judge Esposito noted the lengths to which McDonald’s had gone to prolong the proceedings, including initially refusing to hold pretrial conference calls with the other parties unless the calls were transcribed (a request she denied) and raising questions about the authenticity of documents submitted as evidence by the government, even though most of the documents had been subpoenaed from McDonald’s.
“Without saying it, she was like, McDonald’s just delayed this long enough to have a change, so that they could push through this settlement agreement with a general counsel who was willing, able and wanted it,” Ms. Abruzzo said.
