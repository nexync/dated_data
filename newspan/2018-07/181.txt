Her mood darkened as we drove back down into Sevnica, and parked outside a Communist-era tower on the edge of town. “Now we are making a stop at the apartment block where they lived,” she said, referring to the future first lady, then named Melanija Knavs, and her family.
Over in the town’s tourist office, visitors can buy a book about Mrs. Trump’s early life — “Melania Trump: The Slovenian Side of the Story” — and a wide range of First Lady products, like the chocolate-coated apple slices.
Sevnica was then better known as a minor industrial hub, housing Kopitarna, one of Slovenia’s oldest shoe companies; Stilles, a furniture company that supplies international hotels; and Slovenia’s largest lingerie company, Lisca.
When Mrs. Trump was a child, her mother, Amalija, worked at another clothing factory, which has since closed. Her father, Viktor, is reported to have sold car parts. Few residents remember them from that time — not even Mr. Ocvirk, the mayor, who is just a year older than Mrs. Trump, and would have attended the local elementary school at the same time.
