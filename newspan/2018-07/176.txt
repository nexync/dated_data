The newly announced film, “Rub & Tug,” is based on the real-life story of Dante “Tex” Gill, who ran a string of massage parlors that were fronts for prostitution dens in the 1970s and ’80s.
“I wouldn’t be as upset if I was getting in the same rooms as Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett for cis roles, but we know that’s not the case,” the actress Trace Lysette wrote on Twitter, referring to cisgender people, or those who identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.
“Not only do you play us and steal our narrative and our opportunity but you pat yourselves on the back with trophies and accolades for mimicking what we have lived,” added Ms. Lysette, who is a transgender woman and plays one on the TV series “Transparent,” about a character who comes out as transgender.
Representatives for Ms. Johansson did not respond to emails requesting comment.
Those actors are cisgender but have played transgender characters: Mr. Tambor as a transgender woman on “Transparent”; Mr. Leto as a transgender woman in the 2013 movie “Dallas Buyers Club”; and Ms. Huffman as a transgender woman in the 2005 film “Transamerica.” Mr. Leto won an Oscar for his performance, and Ms. Huffman was nominated for one.
Mr. Tambor left the show last year after Ms. Lysette and another transgender woman, Van Barnes, accused him of sexual misconduct.
Transgender advocates point to casting decisions like those on the television show “Pose” on FX as examples of casting that represents the community reflected in the show. “Pose” focuses on the lives of L.G.B.T. people and stars five transgender women who play transgender characters.
In the column, Ms. Mock described her experience as a transgender woman, and her desire to change how such women were portrayed.
