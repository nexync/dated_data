A brief list of the times the president has invoked a pet locution of autocrats.
After initial reports of contact between campaign aides and Russian intelligence.
A month after taking office, defending himself from news reports that his aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence during the campaign, President Trump called out the media on Twitter using a phrase that surprised even members of the media who had grown accustomed to regular attacks.
“The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @CNN, @NBCNews and many more) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American people. SICK!” the president posted on Twitter. He soon deleted the tweet and posted a revised message that called out ABC and CBS as well.
The invocation spawned a flurry of articles on the history of the use of “enemy of the people,” which may have been used against the Roman emperor Nero to denounce his rule. The phrase was adopted in Nazi Germany — “If someone wears the Jewish star, he is an enemy of the people,” Hitler’s propaganda minister wrote — and, perhaps most famously, in the Soviet Union under Stalin, when being labeled an enemy of the people amounted to a death sentence.
Over the next week, the president repeated the phrase, clarifying that the label applied only to purveyors of “fake news,” not to all media outlets.
Bemoaning leaks from the F.B.I.
More than a year later, with stories of migrant families separated at the border starting to dominate the news, the president used the phrase again after the release of an F.B.I. report detailing anti-Trump texts from an F.B.I. agent and castigating James B. Comey, the former director of the bureau, for insubordination.
Fighting criticism of his meeting with Putin.
His complaints continued after the summit meeting as he received criticism for contradictory statements over whether he believed evidence showing that Mr. Putin had ordered Russian meddling in the election.
