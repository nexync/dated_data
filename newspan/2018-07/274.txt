The humanitarian crisis at the southwest border underscores that as lawyers we must ensure that unaccompanied children and families have access to competent counsel.
Working daily to meet the need on the front lines is the Immigrant Justice Corps. Conceived by Chief Judge Robert Katzmann of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and incubated by the Robin Hood Foundation, the corps is the countryâ€™s first and only fellowship program dedicated wholly to expanding access to counsel by increasing the quantity and quality of the immigration bar.
In the nearly four years since its creation, the corps has trained 140 bilingual lawyers and advocates, with 77 fellows in the program. The fellows have assisted almost 44,000 immigrants and family members, with a 93 percent success rate, meaning when the fellows are able to obtain legal status or citizenship, or help a client challenge deportation and remain with family in the United States.
Built to scale, the corps is positioned to provide legal assistance to immigrant families and children and to supervise volunteer law firm associates.
