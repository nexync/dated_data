The Drawing Center, a small, non-collecting museum in Manhattan’s SoHo district, has announced that its new executive director will be the longtime New York curator Laura Hoptman.
Ms. Hoptman, 56, is currently curator in the department of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art. She has previously occupied curatorial positions in the Modern’s drawing department and at the New Museum. On Sept. 10 she will become the center’s fifth executive director, succeeding Brett Littman, who held the post for 11 years and left in April to become head of the Noguchi Museum in Long Island City. In 2012, Mr. Littman oversaw a redesign of the center’s two-level space on Wooster Street.
The Drawing Center, which attracts 55,000 visitors annually, covered a broader span than the others. It has expanded the history of drawing with, for example, an exhibition of Victor Hugo’s little-known ink studies, while also emphasizing the medium’s flexible role in contemporary art, with surveys of Terry Winters (through Aug. 12), Judith Bernstein and Rashid Johnson, among many.
