WASHINGTON — Pfizer, the giant multinational drug company, said on Tuesday that it would defer some price increases, after President Trump thrashed the company in a Twitter post.
The company — whose products include Celebrex, Lipitor, Premarin, Viagra and Zoloft, as well as Ibrance, a breast cancer treatment that costs about $10,000 a month — retreated one day after Mr. Trump’s tweet.
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he was pleased to see the company backtracking.
At a bill-signing ceremony on May 30, Mr. Trump said major drug companies would, within two weeks, announce “voluntary massive drops in prices.” But until now, there was scant evidence of drug price cuts, and some companies continued to raise prices, seemingly oblivious to the president’s words.
Ian C. Read, the chairman and chief executive of Pfizer, said he had “an extensive discussion with President Trump” on Tuesday. As a result, he said, Pfizer will roll back price increases that took effect on July 1.
David Mitchell, the founder of Patients for Affordable Drugs, a nonprofit advocacy group, applauded the move, but said it was just a start.
In a Rose Garden speech two months ago, Mr. Trump unveiled a “blueprint to lower drug prices,” which included many regulatory and legislative proposals and some vague notions about how to rein in drug costs.
He said the higher prices would revert to the levels in effect last month and would stay there until “the president’s blueprint goes into effect or the end of the year, whichever is sooner.” The price freeze is likely to last six months, as the president’s most important proposals will probably require months of debate and deliberation.
“Pfizer shares the president’s concern for patients and commitment to providing affordable access to the medicines they need,” Mr. Read said.
But some of the most promising and effective new treatments are also among the most expensive — a fact that scares many consumers, insurers and employers who help pay the bills.
