The executive, Brian Crutcher, also resigned from the company’s board. He had taken the helm at the Dallas-based chip maker in June after 22 years at the company, most recently as chief operating officer.
Mr. Crutcher will be replaced by his predecessor, Rich Templeton, who was chief executive for 14 years and stayed on as the company’s chairman after announcing his retirement in January. The company said that Mr. Templeton, 59, would return as president and chief executive indefinitely and that the board was not searching for a replacement.
Texas Instruments shares fell modestly in after-hours trading. But Cody Acree, an analyst for Loop Capital Markets in Dallas, said investors probably wouldn’t be too rattled, especially given Mr. Templeton’s return.
“Rich is such a long-tenured, well-respected and successful prior C.E.O.,” Mr. Acree said.
Founded as an oil and gas company in the 1930s, Texas Instruments later shifted to technology, helping to pioneer the development of the microprocessor in the 1970s and becoming known for its ubiquitous calculators. Under Mr. Templeton, the company turned its focus toward making analog processors used in cars, industrial machinery and other products.
