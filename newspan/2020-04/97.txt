Most of the Orthodox Jewish leaders who have died amid the pandemic have not had big crowds at their funerals, but some have been mourned at large public gatherings like the one on Tuesday in Williamsburg.
Dermot F. Shea, the New York City police commissioner, said on Wednesday that the department learned of Rabbi Mertz’s funeral on Tuesday and made plans to monitor it. Videos posted on social media showed that members of the neighborhood Hasidic safety patrol, known as shomrim, were there as well.
Mr. Shea said the department had thought it was “unlikely” a large crowd would gather for the funeral.
Mr. Shea said 12 summonses were issued for failure to disperse. And he criticized events such as the one on Tuesday for “putting members of my department at risk” and said they would be met with “stern consequences."
Gatherings of any size have been banned in New York State for more than a month as part of the sweeping orders enacted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
