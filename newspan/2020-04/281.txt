Pushed out of their village by a drought and lack of food, a group of Nepalis are fighting to amplify the voices of those forced to relocate by the planet’s warming.
Sonam Chhiring Gurung, 76, is one of Dhye’s few residents now. “I love this village, but I can’t survive here much longer,” he said.
Collecting pond water in Dhye last month, where supplies are increasingly scarce. With so many people’s livelihoods dependent on agriculture, the lack of water seems an insoluble problem.
People who left Dhye resettled nearly a mile downhill, near a stream that was still flowing.
