This weekâ€™s properties are in Gravesend, Forest Hills and the Flatiron district.
In Gravesend, a generously proportioned two-bedroom, one-bath apartment that is being sold furnished, with hardwood floors, five closets, a foyer and a space off the living room that could be used as a dining area or home office, in a 1960s elevator building a little less than a mile from the Coney Island boardwalk.
In Forest Hills, a Tudor-style, four-bedroom, three-full-and-two-half-bath home, with a backyard, a front patio, a finished basement and a wood-burning fireplace.
In the Flatiron district, a two-bedroom, one-bath, duplex apartment, with a private outdoor deck and a modern kitchen, at the top of a 12-story, prewar co-op.
