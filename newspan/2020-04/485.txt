Rumors about the North Korean leader’s health — and speculation over his possible death — have only increased over the past two weeks.
SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea is still sending letters and gifts to foreign leaders and domestic workers in the name of its leader, Kim Jong-un. Its news media brims, as usual, with panegyrical propaganda extolling Mr. Kim’s leadership. South Korea reiterates that it has detected “nothing unusual” in the North. President Trump has called “incorrect” and “fake” a report that Mr. Kim was “in grave danger” after surgery.
