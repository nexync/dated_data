The G20 is expected to meet this week over the oil glut.
Eric Artz, the chief executive of the outdoor apparel retailer REI, said on Monday that the company would furlough the majority of its employees for 90 days beginning April 15, but it will continue to provide health care and other benefits. Mr. Artz will forgo his salary for six months and senior executives will take a 20 percent pay cut.
