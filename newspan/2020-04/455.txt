What if Donald Trump had become the owner of a goldendoodle?
Dogs have been part of the presidency longer than the White House itself. George Washington owned an array of foxhounds named Drunkard, Mopsey, Taster, Cloe, Tipsy, Forester, Captain, Lady Rover, Sweet Lips and Searcher, among others. The White House has been lousy with dogs since, from Abraham Lincoln’s Jip to Lyndon Johnson’s long-suffering beagles, Him and Her. And more than just dogs; according to the online Presidential Pet Museum, the White House grounds have hosted cows, chickens, a goat, a pair of bald eagles, Shawl Neck game chickens, at least one alligator and a tobacco-chewing ram.  Plus a pair of lion cubs, named — seriously — Tax Reduction and Budget Bureau.
Maybe. But if he’d become the owner of a goldendoodle, maybe he’d have had a different relationship — and not just with “his people,” but with all of us. Because a dog might have encouraged Mr. Trump to take himself just a little less seriously. Because a dog might have given him someone to love besides himself.
Mr. President, I want to believe that somewhere deep inside you, there is a good boy, still waiting to be born.
