My mother told me that I was rolling over at 4 months, but my baby isn’t. Should I be concerned?No. This is one of those milestones that has changed over time. In the 1990s, the back-to-sleep-campaign aimed to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) by counseling parents to put infants to sleep on their backs. As a result, many babies didn’t get as much stomach time as they used to, so they began to roll over at later ages. That’s fine! You can help by giving them extra tummy time while they’re awake and supervised, but don’t sweat it.
If my second child is slower to develop than the first, does that mean something is wrong?No. My first child didn’t walk until he was 16 months old. My second child walked at 11 months. Both play on the tennis team today. What was important was that, globally, they were developing and progressing over time.
I still sometimes have trouble soothing my baby. Does this mean that he can’t hear me or that something is wrong?Not necessarily. While your physician should confirm that his hearing is fine, many babies are still fussy at 4 months. Colic, or episodes of intense crying or fussiness for no apparent reason, usually peaks at around 6 weeks and improves by 3 to 4 months. Don’t be afraid to discuss this with your doctor.
If my baby is behind on a milestone, does that mean she will never catch up?No. Babies catch up all the time. In fact, one of the reasons we screen using developmental milestones is so that we can pick up delays and intervene in order to help them do so.
