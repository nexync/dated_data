This week’s properties are in Sunset Park, on the Upper West Side, and in Riverdale.
In Sunset Park, Brooklyn, a bright one-bedroom, one-bath corner apartment, with exposed brick and ceiling beams, wood floors, recessed lighting and windows in every room, across the street from Sunset Park in one of the neighborhood’s Finnish co-ops, which were constructed by immigrants from Finland in the early part of the last century.
On the Upper West Side, a one-bedroom, one-bath apartment with tall ceilings and a fireplace, on the fourth floor of a prewar walk-up that is less than a block from Central Park.
In Riverdale, the Bronx, a 1,250-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath apartment, on the second floor of a postwar co-op with a doorman, parking, a gym and a playground.
