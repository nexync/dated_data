My 1-year-old is getting into more and more mischief. Whatâ€™s the best way to discipline her?
Will raising my toddler in a bilingual home negatively affect his development? There is a common misconception that if you live in a bilingual or multilingual household, your child will have a speech delay. This is not true. Some toddlers who hear more than one language at home may accidentally mix the languages or say some words in each language, but this will not stop them from developing language skills. Continue to speak, read and sing to them in whichever language you prefer. You are creating important connections for their brains and useful skills for the future.
