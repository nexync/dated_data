A doctor stricken with Covid-19 was running out of options. His family mounted a search for a donor whose plasma might help.
Under a national program overseen by the Mayo Clinic and authorized in early April by the Food and Drug Administration, about 2,500 patients at U.S. hospitals have been given the experimental treatment that Dr. Laroche’s family sought. The F.D.A. has also granted “numerous” applications from individual doctors to use convalescent plasma for Covid-19 patients, the agency said in a recent statement.
