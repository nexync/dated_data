Note: Numbers are median estimates that the Northeastern model calculated for each city. The true number of infections could have been substantially higher or lower than shown here.
Dr. Heguy’s team and another at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have found through genetic analysis that the seeds of most infections in New York came from multiple locations in Europe, rather than directly from China.
Others said that the findings were in line with the fragmentary evidence that had been available until now. Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology and statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, said that her own risk estimates and most recent projections reveal a grim stealthiness of early coronavirus spread.
The virus moved under the radar swiftly in February and March, doctors and researchers said, because few cities or states had adequate surveillance systems in place. And testing, if it was being done at all, was haphazard. Emergency rooms were busy preparing for the predicted onslaught and likely missed some early virus-related deaths, and did not have the time or tools to verify infections on the fly, experts said.
It was mid-March before teams at N.Y.U. and Mount Sinai began taking samples for testing in New York. On Thursday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced results from antibody testing of grocery store shoppers— which researchers warned were preliminary and could change — that suggests one of every five New Yorkers may have been infected.
The new findings from the model produce a range of possible outcomes for when the virus may have infected 10 people in each city. In New York, for example, the model shows that the first 10 infected people could have been walking the streets of the city as early as the last week in January, or as late as the middle of February. From there, the infections in the centers of the outbreak grew exponentially.
