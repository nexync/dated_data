Comic-book creators contributed their work, and buyers made their bids on Twitter, to help employees and businesses upended by the coronavirus.
Up for bid were comics, original art and one-of-a-kind experiences. More than 100 contributors participated, using the Twitter hashtag #Creators4Comics, with proceeds going to the Book Industry Charitable Foundation.
John Robinson, the co-owner with Jamie Graham of Graham Crackers Comics, a chain of stores primarily in Illinois, said he had had to furlough nearly all his employees. When he read about the foundation, he encouraged workers to apply for aid. “One person told me that they helped with a mortgage payment,” he said, adding that the aid had arrived within a week.
