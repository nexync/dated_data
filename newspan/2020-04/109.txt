But a new wrinkle surfaced in the government’s arguments late Wednesday, after court documents in a separate matter between WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, and NSO Group, an Israeli spyware maker, revealed that Mr. Wray’s law firm previously argued in favor of strong end-to-end encryption while representing WhatsApp in a sealed 2015 case involving the Justice Department.
In the earlier case, which has never been made public, Mr. Wray, then a partner at King & Spalding, was hired to “analyze and protect” WhatsApp’s software from a Justice Department effort to weaken its encryption in order to conduct wiretap of a WhatsApp user’s data.
Details of Mr. Wray’s involvement in the 2015 case were made public in a WhatsApp court filing unsealed Wednesday involving WhatsApp and NSO. WhatsApp is asking a Northern California District Court judge to disqualify King & Spalding from representing NSO, citing conflicts of interest, given the firm’s previous representation of WhatsApp.
The New York Times learned of the 2015 matter through confidential sources. At the time, the Justice Department was also engaged in a court battle with Apple, pushing the company to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the gunmen in a shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The government ultimately dropped its case after security researchers helped them bypass Apple’s security.
In a statement Thursday, a WhatsApp spokesman reiterated the company’s commitment to making end-to-end encryption the default option for WhatsApp messages and calls, and would continue to defend its technology in courts.
He was responding, in part, to an announcement last year by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, that Facebook plans to extend end-to-end encryption to Facebook’s other platforms, including Instagram and Facebook Messenger.
