The vice president, who leads the White House’s coronavirus task force, said that masks were meant to prevent the spread of the virus and that he was tested regularly and does not have it.
Vice President Mike Pence did not wear a mask while visiting coronavirus patients at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, a violation of the facility’s policy.
It was the latest example of Mr. Pence’s refusal to don a face mask even as he travels the country representing the administration. This month, he was photographed arriving in Colorado Springs and being greeted by the Democratic governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, who wore a face mask emblazoned with images from his state flag. Mr. Pence tapped elbows, but kept his face bare.
Mr. Pence was immediately rebuked by the administration’s critics.
But he has one important ally — President Trump.
