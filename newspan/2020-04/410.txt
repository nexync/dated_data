Politics|They Turned Out to Vote in Wisconsin During a Health Crisis. Here’s Why.
Voters in Milwaukee and across the state braved long lines and a risk of illness. Many said they wanted their voices to be heard. But for some, the potential health risk was too great.
Mary Corder, 70, usually votes in her senior assisted living facility, but decided she couldn’t vote in this election after the location was shut down. Ms. Corder said she found out her polling place was closed only yesterday, after voting there for years.
Throughout the city, residents sought to help one another stay safe and upbeat. One house opposite Riverside High School blared a playlist of James Brown, Bill Withers and other soul artists to keep the waiting voters energized. State Representative David Bowen, a Democrat in Milwaukee who contracted the coronavirus but has recovered, picked up absentee ballots from sick residents and delivered them to the post office. Breana Stephens, a 29-year-old teacher, traveled to the school on her own to pass out Clorox wipes, fresh pens and gloves for those in need.
