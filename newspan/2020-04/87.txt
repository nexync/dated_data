Mike DeWine, a low-key career politician, has followed health expertsâ€™ guidance as Ohio confronts the coronavirus. His constituents are overwhelmingly appreciative.
For 40 years, Mike DeWine rose steadily if blandly up the ladder of Ohio politics, finally landing his dream job as governor. He took office last year as a familiar figure in the state, not because of any indelible political identity, but because, at 72, he had been around forever.
On Tuesday, the governor said that after getting pushback, he had downgraded the mask rule for store customers to a recommendation, not a mandate.
