Jim Bello, 49 and healthy, fell gravely ill, highlighting agonizing mysteries of the coronavirus. Doctors’ relentless effort to save him was a roller-coaster of devastating and triumphant twists.
Mr. Bello, 49, an athletic and healthy lawyer, had developed a 103 degree fever in early March after a hike in the White Mountains in New Hampshire and landed in a suburban emergency room six days later, struggling to breathe.
Risks can include bleeding complications and strokes. ECMO specialists must continually ensure that the blood volume circulating through the machine isn’t too low or too high, so that patients don’t get too much fluid and their blood vessels don’t collapse.
Because visitors are largely prohibited in order to limit the virus’s spread, a nurse, Kerri Voelkel, put the family on speaker phone in Mr. Bello's room several times daily.
She was told she'd have 15 minutes, but was given more than three hours.
