He swathed his nudes and still lifes of eggs, vases, bottles and bowls in a breathless, deceptively serene atmosphere heavy with mystery.
William Bailey, whose pristine, idealized still lifes and female nudes made him one of the leading figures in the return of figurative art in the 1980s, died on April 13 at his home in Branford, Conn. He was 89.
A revival of interest in figurative painting in the early 1980s propelled Mr. Bailey to the cover of Newsweek, which chose his seminude “Portrait of S” to epitomize the trend. Shocked retailers across the country pulled the magazine from their shelves.
On returning to the United States, he enrolled in Yale University’s art school, where he studied with the abstract painter Josef Albers. He earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1955 and a master’s degree two years later.
