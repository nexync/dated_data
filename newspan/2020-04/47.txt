Health|Can Antibody Tests Help End the Coronavirus Pandemic?
The tests are not reliable enough to guide policy on lockdowns and reopenings, experts said. But they can help model the spread of the virus.
New York’s results suggested a death rate of between 0.5 and 1 percent, figures some conservative commentators have argued are too low to justify statewide lockdowns.
The New York survey confirms what experts have long believed: that because of the lack of tests, the state has undercounted the true number of infections by about a factor of 10.
Another lesson from the survey: New York is far from attaining “herd immunity” — a proportion of the community immune to the virus that is so large that the pathogen cannot maintain a toehold.
“We’re kind of heavily leaning on these tests when they’re not perfect,” said Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.
