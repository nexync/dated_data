Climate|Emissions Declines Will Set Records This Year. But It’s Not Good News.
WASHINGTON — Global greenhouse gas emissions are on track to plunge nearly 8 percent this year, the largest drop ever recorded, as worldwide lockdowns to fight the coronavirus have triggered an “unprecedented” decline in the use of fossil fuels, the International Energy Agency said in a new report on Thursday.
More than 4 billion people are living in countries that have imposed partial or more extensive shutdowns on economic activity to slow the spread of the virus. By mid-April, the report found, energy use in many of those countries was 17 percent to 25 percent lower than it was in 2019, as factories idled, employees stopped driving to work and airlines grounded their flights.
If countries remain locked down for longer than expected, or if businesses struggle to recover from the pandemic, the drop in emissions could be larger. By contrast, getting the virus under control faster would mean a smaller dip in emissions this year.
The report also noted that, after past crises, global emissions have typically shot back up to previous levels once the initial shock passed. And if countries like China try to help their ailing economies by relaxing environmental rules or subsidizing polluting industries like coal or steel, the resulting rebound in emissions could be even larger than the decline.
That’s what happened after the financial crisis a decade ago: By 2010, global emissions had surged back higher than ever before as nations invested heavily in fossil fuels to lift themselves out of the recession.
