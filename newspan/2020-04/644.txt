President Trump doesn’t hide the fact that he rejects many of the constraints on presidential power that every other post-Watergate president has accepted.
1. Yesterday, he ousted Glenn Fine, a well-respected inspector general who was supposed to oversee the $2 trillion spending in the recent coronavirus bill.
2. On Friday night, Trump fired Michael Atkinson, the watchdog for the intelligence community who helped set off impeachment proceedings by forwarding an anonymous complaint about Trump to Congress.
3. On March 27, shortly after signing the coronavirus bill, Trump issued a statement that asserted his right to reinterpret the law and not forward information to Congress about a corporate bailout fund.
4. Twice this week, Trump publicly attacked an inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services, who has documented the shortages many hospitals now face.
All of it adds up to “an abruptly unfolding White House power play over semi-independent inspectors general across the government,” as Charlie Savage — a Times reporter who has won a Pulitzer Prize for exposés of presidential signing statements — wrote.
