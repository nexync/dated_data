DON’T: Wear the mask below your nose.
DON’T: Leave your chin exposed.
DON’T: Wear your mask loosely with gaps on the sides.
DON’T: Wear your mask so it covers just the tip of your nose.
DON’T: Push your mask under your chin to rest on your neck.
DO: Wear your mask so it comes all the way up, close to the bridge of your nose, and all the way down under your chin. Do your best to tighten the loops or ties so it’s snug around your face, without gaps.
