If my second child is slower to develop than the first, does that mean something is wrong?
No. My first child didnâ€™t walk until he was 16 months old. My second child walked at 11 months. Both play on the tennis team today. What was important was that, globally, they were developing and progressing over time.
If my baby is behind on a milestone, does that mean she will never catch up?
No. Babies catch up all the time. In fact, one of the reasons we screen using developmental milestones is so that we can pick up delays and intervene in order to help them do so.
