Even before the coronavirus swept through care facilities, many were struggling with thin profit margins. Now they could be wiped out.
For-profit nursing homes often rent their properties under long-term leases from real estate investment trusts, known as REITs; investment firms; or private equity shops. A review of regulatory filings found that six major health care REITs — Sabra, Welltower, National Health Investors, Omega Healthcare Investors, LTC and CareTrust — had a business interest in more than 1,500 nursing homes.
The Times has tallied more than 4,000 nursing homes and other long-term care or elder facilities across the United States with coronavirus cases, based on reports by states and counties. More than 36,500 residents and staff members at those facilities have contracted the virus, and more than 7,000 have died. The names of most of those facilities have not been made public, but The Times has been able to identify at least 1,700 nursing homes on that list of facilities, which have reported 4,000 deaths.
