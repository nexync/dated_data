Even some public officials have challenged social-distancing requirements, calling them assaults on the Constitution. One group wants to gather up to 1,000 people for Easter.
Many of the latest claims about the Constitution have come from Idaho’s northern panhandle, where vaccination rates for other diseases have always been low and wariness of government is high.
Much of the region’s tensions revolve around skepticism over medical leaders’ advice, which some people here regard as unwarranted. Mr. Bundy compared the effects of the virus to the flu, even though epidemiologists have warned that it can kill at a much higher rate.
Dr. Robert Burnett, the medical director for cardiovascular surgery at Kootenai Health in Coeur d’Alene, just south of Ms. Scott’s district, said he viewed the comments from the lawmaker and the sheriff as “criminal.” He said he was “horrified” that public officials would use their platforms to encourage behavior that threatens lives.
Mr. Remington, the lawmaker who also serves as a pastor, said he had heard from the lieutenant governor that churches would be considered essential and proceeded accordingly. But the official order does not list churches as essential.
After the governor’s order, Mr. Remington said, the church encouraged parishioners to stay home unless they felt they needed to join with other worshipers for their well-being. He said the church provides services for people in substance-abuse rehabilitation and wanted to keep the doors open for them while encouraging social distancing and offering masks.
