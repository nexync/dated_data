Worldreader already had the technology, through its mobile reading app, to deliver digital texts to people with limited access to books. But the coronavirus pandemic suddenly made that project even more urgent. With countries across the globe on lockdown and public life at a standstill, more than 1.5 billion children are out of school, many of them cast into educational limbo, according to a United Nations agency. The pandemic has made it even harder for children in poor communities to access books, even as children in wealthier households adapt to online schools. As the crisis drags on, some fear that the education gap could widen permanently.
