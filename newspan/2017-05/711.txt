One of the most lauded new Off Broadway musicals of the just-wrapped theater season is moving uptown.
“The Band’s Visit,” based on the 2007 film about an Egyptian police band that mistakenly winds up in a remote Israeli town, will open at the Barrymore Theater on Broadway this fall, the show’s producers announced on Wednesday. The musical features a book by Itamar Moses (“Nobody Loves You”), based on the screenplay by Eran Kolirin, with music and lyrics by the Tony-nominated composer David Yazbek (“The Full Monty”). David Cromer, who directed the original production at the Atlantic Theater Company last year, will again direct on Broadway.
Performances at the Barrymore are to start on Oct. 7, with opening night set for Nov. 9. Casting is to be announced; Tony Shalhoub, Katrina Lenk and John Cariani all earned positive reviews in their roles at the Atlantic.
In an interview, Mr. Cromer said he doesn’t anticipate that the footprint of the show will change much on a bigger stage.
In his review for The New York Times, Ben Brantley called “The Band’s Visit” a “beautiful” and “slyly seductive show” with “one of the season’s most exquisitely wrought scores.” The production has received best musical awards left and right this season, including from the Obies, the New York Drama Critics’ Circle and the Outer Critics Circle.
Mr. Cromer said he hopes the show’s thematic focus on how a community bridges cultural divides through song will resonate with audiences.
The show is being produced by Orin Wolf, John Styles and John N. Hart Jr. Mr. Wolf has been a producer on several Broadway shows, including “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical” and the recent revival of “Fiddler on the Roof,” and is the president of NETworks Presentations, a company that focuses on national tours.
