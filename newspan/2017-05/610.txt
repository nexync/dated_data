The Caan Film Festival? Yes, Caan.
Can’t make it to the south of France to catch a movie this week? The Museum of the Moving Image in Queens provides a puckish alternative: the Caan Film Festival. James Caan.
Mr. Caan is probably best known for his roles as Sonny Corleone in the “Godfather” saga and Walter, Buddy’s father in “Elf.” This survey, running through May 28, screens 12 other works from a career spanning more than 50 years and numerous genres. On Sunday, May 21, there’s “Brian’s Song,” the TV movie that forged the template for the sports weeper. Friday brings the sci-fi “Rollerball,” in which Mr. Caan is Jonathan E., a hero for a dystopian society that channels its homicidal urges into a variation of roller derby.
