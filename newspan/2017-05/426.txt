Dr. Kellene Vokaty Eagen and Brian Richard Schneirow were married May 20 at the Log Cabin in the Presidio park in San Francisco. Kathleen H. Eagen, the bride’s sister, was ordained through American Marriage Ministries to officiate.
Dr. Eagen, 35, is the medical director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health’s Medical Respite and Sobering Center, which serves the city’s homeless population, and practices as a family physician at the Tom Waddell Urban Health Clinic there. She is also an attending physician in the family and community medicine department at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, and is a clinical instructor teaching medical residents there in the department of family and community medicine.
She graduated magna cum laude from Duke and received a medical degree from the University of Chicago.
The bride is a daughter of Judith V. Eagen and Arthur T. Eagen of Grayslake, Ill. The bride’s father retired as an electrical engineer in the sales division at S&C Electric Company, a Chicago manufacturer of high-voltage switching equipment used by electric utilities. Her mother retired as the bookkeeper at Heynssens & Grassman, an architectural landscaping firm in Park City, Ill.
Mr. Schneirow, 43, is an engineering manager in the YouTube unit of Google, in San Bruno, Calif. He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles.
He is the son of Marcia A. Schneirow and Burton J. Schneirow of Woodland Hills, Calif. His father retired as a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles.
The couple met twice on OkCupid, first in 2010, when the bride was a resident and working 30-hour shifts, and then again in 2015, when she gave a thumbs up to his profile without recognizing him in the thumbnail picture on her phone. But he immediately recognized her and sent her a message suggesting dinner a few nights later to catch up.
