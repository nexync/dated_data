Fact and fiction blend nicely in “Tracktown,” the modest, appealing feature debut of Alexi Pappas, an American-born runner who competed for Greece at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Ms. Pappas — who, with Jeremy Teicher, also wrote, produced and directed — plays Plumb Marigold, an Olympic hopeful in Eugene, Ore., who discovers that there is life, and love, off the track.
Plumb, who lives an insular existence with her father (Andy Buckley), is training with her best friend (Rebecca Friday) when she takes a shine to Sawyer (an affable, understated Chase Offerle), who works at a bakery on their route. After a doctor tells Plumb that she must rest for a day before competing in the Olympic trials — an option that’s anathema to her — she drops in on Sawyer, and soon is visiting his truck camper, weighing her attraction against the demands of her sport.
“Tracktown” nails the athletic details: the raw eggs and specialized diet; the sensuality of toned bodies in exertion; the glitter of sports celebrity. And the attendant anxieties: “I look like a boy,” Plumb nervously tells Sawyer when he first beholds her taut abdomen. There is a subplot concerning Plumb’s estranged mother (Rachel Dratch, on point), but the film doesn’t stray far from romance.
Ms. Pappas has little dialogue, but the camera adores her expressive, wide-eyed face, which conveys plenty. It will be interesting to see her evolve as an actress. As a writer, she has sound instincts: “Tracktown” is less about winning races and more about a greater victory, being true to yourself.
