The National Aging in Place Council, a trade group, is developing a social worker training program with Stony Brook University. It wants to have a dedicated set of social workers at the council, funded by donations, who are able to field calls from seniors and their caretakers, and make referrals to local service providers.
The council already works with volunteers and small businesses in 25 cities to make referrals for things like home repair and remodeling, daily money management and legal issues.
