TEHRAN — President Trump, who has never made a secret of his hostility toward Iran, called recently for a grand regional strategy among Sunni nations to isolate the country. But Tehran received that threat with surprising equanimity because, in practice, the Trump administration has shown a willingness to do business with the country.
“They took part in the negotiations; and at the table, they respectfully spoke to the representatives of the Iranian nation,” Mr. Rouhani said of the American representatives to the nuclear negotiations. “We had a win-win outcome there, one which I believe was to the benefit of Iran, all P5+1 member states and the world,” he said at the news conference, using the diplomatic name for the countries at the negotiating table with Iran: the United States, Britain, Russia, China, France and Germany.
