The British actor Roger Moore, best known for playing James Bond in seven films, has died at 89.
The Times reviewed each of Mr. Moore’s outings as Agent 007. Below are our takes.
A thread that runs through a dozen years of coverage: Mr. Moore didn’t make the best Bond movies. But they are far from the worst.
You can buy or rent all these movies on popular streaming platforms, and “For Your Eyes Only” and “A View to a Kill” are free to stream for Hulu subscribers.
Moore’s first outing as James Bond. Enough color and zing, if no house afire.
James Bond in Asia. No powerhouse but O.K.
James Bond teams up with Russian agent. Still percolating at this point.
James Bond goes intergalactic. Very zingy, though not the crest.
Moore retains an ageless cool. Not the best of the series by a long shot, but it’s far from the worst.
Bond adventure No. 13, with fake Fabergé egg and threats of WWIII. Formula still working.
 Moore’s last Bond, and probably just as well.
