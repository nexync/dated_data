I went to a corporate event where the hosts served towers of Ladurée macarons for dessert. I knew there would be many cookies left over, so I swiped one of the towers and took it home.
I got a lot of curious glances on the subway. I decided it was rude to walk around with this load of expensive treats and not share them. I started to offer them to other passengers, and although a lot of people refused, I also got some grateful and excited yeses. Many of the people who tried the macarons had never tasted one before. It was fun to see their eyes widen with joy as they consumed the delicate morsels.
My favorite response by far came from two men standing in front of me on an uptown C train with whom I chatted after they accepted some cookies. I figured they were a couple based on their body language, but when we got to 86th Street, they hugged, and only one got off the train.
The price of confession on a New York subway car? Apparently, it’s just one cookie.
