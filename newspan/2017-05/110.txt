There, a brittle layer of shifting regulations sat atop a lava field of private contempt for Muslims on the part of some public officials who felt free to send email “jokes” that President Barack Obama was a Muslim, an illegal immigrant and a communist.

More than five years ago, the Islamic Society of Basking Ridge sought permits to build a mosque big enough for 150 people on a four-acre parcel, where zoning permitted houses of worship. Basking Ridge falls within Bernards Township.
This week, there is still no mosque — but five years of hearings and litigation about the proposal are drawing to a close.

Details of the settlement were not announced, but it will include the building permit long denied to the organization.
