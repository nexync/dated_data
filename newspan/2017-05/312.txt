A noose was found Wednesday at an exhibition on segregation inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, the Smithsonian Institution announced.
Museum visitors found the noose on the floor in front of a display titled, “Democracy Abroad. Injustice at Home,” and it was reported to the United States Park Police. The permanent exhibition, “Defending Freedom, Defining Freedom: Era of Segregation 1876-1968,” was closed but reopened about three hours after the discovery, the Smithsonian said.
The noose found on Wednesday afternoon was the second one to have been discovered in the past week at the Smithsonian museum complex on the National Mall. On Saturday, the Park Police removed a noose from a tree outside the Hirshhorn Museum, which exhibits contemporary art.
The Smithsonian and the Park Police are working together on both cases. No arrests had been made as of Wednesday night.
“The Smithsonian family stands together in condemning this act of hatred and intolerance, especially repugnant in a museum that affirms and celebrates the American values of inclusion and diversity,” David J. Skorton, the secretary of the Smithsonian, wrote in an email to his staff.
The National Museum of African American History and Culture opened last September. The segregation exhibition is the second stop on a tour there and includes artifacts of the post-Civil War area, including the metal coffin of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy lynched in Mississippi in 1955.
Lonnie G. Bunch III, the director of the museum, told its staff members that the episode was a reminder of the discrimination and challenges that African-Americans still face.
“The noose has long represented a deplorable act of cowardice and depravity — a symbol of extreme violence for African-Americans,” he wrote in an email.
