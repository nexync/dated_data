TEHRAN — Iran’s supreme leader issued a warning on Wednesday, saying there was a chance that some individuals — he was not clear which — might interfere in Friday’s presidential elections. In 2009, widespread allegations of fraud led to street protests that rocked the country for six months.
The divisions are playing out in provincial towns as well as in the capital, Tehran. Every night, tens of thousands of people take to the streets around the country, waving the posters of their favorite candidates.
Supporters of Mr. Raisi chant that Mr. Rouhani will be out of a job after Saturday, when the results come in. At the same time, urban Iranians fully expect Mr. Rouhani to win, and they are likely to suspect fraud if he falls short.
In 2009, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s re-election bid took place in a similarly tense atmosphere. When the authorities said he had won, huge protests erupted, leading to months of unrest.
Some analysts say that Mr. Khamenei’s warning shows that there is concern within Iran’s establishment that certain groups might try to alter the outcome of the vote. Others say it might also be aimed at eliciting maximum voter turnout, an important measure of the government’s credibility. That said, many Iranians, particularly in Tehran, say they vote only to prevent a hard-line candidate from taking power.
