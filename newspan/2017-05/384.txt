If you include the nearly 25 years I spent in the military, I have practiced medicine around the world for more than 40 years. I saw patients in remote villages during a year in Ethiopia, delivered a baby in an ambulance in Sardinia and responded to emergencies in submarines and on the deck of an aircraft carrier.
I attended to diplomats when I was posted to the United States Embassy in London in the 1970s while Henry A. Kissinger practiced shuttle diplomacy during the Vietnam War. I saw indigenous Kuna natives on offshore islands while studying tropical diseases in Panama.
Later, stationed in Washington, I treated senior government officials. There were episodes of “Is there a doctor on board?” on planes over the Atlantic, at religious services with passed-out congregants, on city streets where bicyclists had fallen, and, once, in Central Park to help an equestrian who had toppled to the ground.
Just when I thought I’d seen it all, I had another unique experience. I was passing East 53rd Street while taking an M4 bus up Madison Avenue around 7 o’clock one night when I got a call from my regular squash partner. He had pulled a muscle during a tournament game and wanted some medical advice.
He was at the corner of Madison and 60th Street waiting for the bus. I told him to jump on the M4 that was about to arrive there and I would have a look at his injury.
It was my first call on a bus.
