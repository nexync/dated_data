Basketball came naturally to Kenny Anderson. A sensational point guard from Queens, he was named a high school all-American four years running. After Anderson spent two years at Georgia Tech, the New Jersey Nets made him the No. 2 pick in the 1991 N.B.A. draft. He was all of 20.
Yet as “Mr. Chibbs,” Jill Campbell’s documentary, notes, Anderson’s career plateaued. He was an All-Star in 1994 and made tens of millions of dollars. Even so, he bounced around, playing for nine teams over 14 seasons. The last time he made any real basketball news, it was as a member of the team Dennis Rodman took to North Korea in 2014.
“Mr. Chibbs” — the nickname Anderson’s mother gave him — chronicles a pro athlete in midlife crisis. Now in his 40s, he ticks off his situation: father of eight; married three times; a bankruptcy filing. He briefly coached at a Florida high school, a job he loved but lost after a D.U.I. arrest. “I’m a walking mistake,” he says.
Anderson is candid, rueful and self-knowing. He acknowledges the therapy he undergoes for the sex abuse he endured as a youngster and the depression he fights. He says he wasn’t there for his children, and is only now learning to be a better father and husband. Still, the film, like its subject, frustrates in its inability to focus; there is no deep inquiry into what makes Anderson tick. It’s like skimming a stone across a lake.
Ms. Campbell follows Anderson on a memory tour, visiting places and people from his past. At the LeFrak City housing complex, where he grew up, former neighbors still love him. His onetime agent, David Falk, suggests that he mentor N.B.A. rookies about the hazards of early wealth. Kenny Smith, another great guard from Queens, urges him to figure out what he wants to do next and “jump in the pool, man.” You still got game, Kenny, his friends tell him. Just drive.
