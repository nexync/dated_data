Re “Tearful Appeal Sheds Light on Health Coverage for Infants With Birth Defects” (news article, May 4): Jimmy Kimmel conveyed a simple but powerful message in his monologue about his newborn son’s birth defect: that in a wealthy country, we as Americans should be able to come together to find a way to prevent our children from dying from treatable diseases.
Mr. Kimmel also showed us an example of what is missing in the current debate — the ability to put oneself into someone else’s shoes. Though a multimillionaire himself, Mr. Kimmel could imagine the struggles of other parents with fewer financial resources.
While being scared for his own family, he was also scared for the families who would be financially devastated by paying for their child’s medical care if provisions for affordable insurance for those with pre-existing conditions are not guaranteed. I hope Congress will follow his example.
