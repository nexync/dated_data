Now lives In a two-bedroom apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with his fiancée, the product designer Sam Anderson, and a roommate.
Claim to fame In 2014, Mr. Wolfond founded Good Thing, a design company that makes pared-down, utilitarian housewares that are as on-trend as they are affordable. The line includes steel dustpans ($29), cylindrical bookends ($16) and silicone-dipped stainless steel mirrors ($19.50 to $34) in standout colors like powder pink, mint green and cobalt blue. “You get the more useful version of the thing, and it also becomes a piece of decoration,” Mr. Wolfond said.
When efforts to license his designs soured, he recruited other emerging designers and began manufacturing products on his own. “I realized, ‘Oh, if you have these other designers and yourself, you can call it a manufacturing company,’” Mr. Wolfond said. Products by Good Thing are carried by museum stores across the country, including the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, the Guggenheim, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery of Art and the Walker Art Center.
Latest Projects Good Thing is presenting a new collection Sunday through Wednesday at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York, including side tables by Chen Chen & Kai Williams ($220 each), and an aluminum stool by MSDS Studio ($240). The company has also collaborated with Harry’s, the shaving company, on an exhibition of experimental brushes at the WantedDesign Manhattan fair Saturday through Tuesday.
