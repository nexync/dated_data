Carrying torches and chanting angrily, demonstrators marched Saturday in a Virginia city against a vote to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, leading the city’s mayor to compare the rally to a gathering of the Ku Klux Klan.
According to local news reports, the protesters gathered in Lee Park, which is named for the general, shortly after 9 p.m. and were dispersed by the police after about 10 minutes.
“This event involving torches at night in Lee Park was either profoundly ignorant or was designed to instill fear in our minority populations in a way that hearkens back to the days of the K.K.K.,” he said.
The statue of Lee is one of many public works celebrating the memory of the Confederacy that have become flash points for debate this year, as lawmakers throughout the South reckon with a Civil War history that is being revived in new battles over race and history.
Members of the nebulous, internet-based white nationalist movement represented by Mr. Spencer have in some cases glommed onto these local conflicts.
The Charlottesville City Council voted in April to sell the statue, which stands in Lee Park. But a circuit court judge in the city issued a six-month injunction this month to halt the removal of the statue, after a collection of individuals and groups, including the Virginia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, filed a lawsuit against the city in March.
