The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced Monday that it is organizing the largest exhibition of Michelangelo works in its history, opening in November.
The exhibition, titled “Michelangelo: Divine Draftsman and Designer,” will contain 150 drawings, three marble sculptures, his first known painting (“The Torment of Saint Anthony”), and other works, from collections all over the United States and Europe.
Among the works to be displayed include a cartoon that Michelangelo drew for his final fresco at the Vatican Palace and a series of drawings that he made for Tommaso de’Cavalieri, who was said to be the object of Michelangelo’s affections.
Currently, the Met has three works by Michelangelo: Two drawings (“Studies for the Libyan Sibyl,” “Design for the Tomb of Pope Julius II della Rovere”) and a sculpture, “Young Archer,” which is on loan from the French government. A spokeswoman for the museum said the two drawings were typically not exhibited because of their sensitivity to the light, but they will be part of the show.
The exhibition, organized by Carmen C. Bambach, is set to open Nov. 13 and will run through February 2018.
