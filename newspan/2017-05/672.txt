White nationalism lost in France yesterday, and it lost big.
Marine Le Pen, the far-right presidential candidate, won only 34 percent of votes in her two-way race against Emmanuel Macron, who will soon be France’s president. Roger Cohen calls Macron’s victory “an important demonstration that reason and coherence still matter in politics.” Nate Silver notes that Macron outperformed the pre-election polls by more than either Brexit or Donald Trump did.
The United States also had an extremist presidential candidate — one who mocked the disabled, retweeted neo-Nazis, called Mexicans rapists, promised to ban Muslims from the country and bragged about molesting women. He won the presidency, thanks to overwhelming support from the Republican party.
