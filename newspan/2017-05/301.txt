WASHINGTON — President Trump praised President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines in a phone call last month for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem” in the island nation where the government has sanctioned gunning down suspects in the streets. Mr. Trump also boasted that the United States has “two nuclear submarines” off the coast of North Korea but said he does not want to use them.
That led Mr. Trump to inquire whether Mr. Kim, the 33-year-old North Korean leader, is “someone who is stable or not stable.” Mr. Duterte offered up the opinion that Mr. Kim was unstable, noting that he is always seen laughing in pictures of missile and nuclear tests.
Mr. Trump seemed to try to reassure Mr. Duterte. Mr. Kim, he said, “has got the powder, but he doesn’t have the delivery system — all his rockets are crashing.” The president said nothing of the American-led program to sabotage the launches, though in some tests both before and after the call, the North has conducted several successful launches.
The transcript was widely circulated on Tuesday, and The Washington Post and The Intercept both published articles based on the same document.
“I will love to have you in the Oval Office, anytime you want to come,” Mr. Trump said.
