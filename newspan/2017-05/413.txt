LONDON — Glenda Jackson, the Oscar-winning actress and former member of the British Parliament who returned to the stage last fall at the age of 80 as King Lear, will star on Broadway next year in Edward Albee’s play “Three Tall Women,” the producers announced on Thursday.
The Emmy Award winner Laurie Metcalf will also star. Joe Mantello will direct the production, which will begin previews in February.
“Three Tall Women,” which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1994, has never before had a Broadway run. The play centers largely on a well-to-do woman in her 90s, modeled on Albee’s mother, as she looks back over her life. Mr. Albee died in 2016 at 88.
While many had expected Ms. Jackson to play King Lear in New York, a publicist for the Old Vic theater in London, which staged the production, said by email on Friday that there were no plans for a transfer.
Ms. Jackson last appeared on Broadway in a 1988 production of “Macbeth.” She served as a Labour representative for a district of north London for 23 years, starting in the early 1990s. She has been nominated for a Tony Award for each of her four Broadway appearances.
