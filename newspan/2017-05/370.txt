A Public Overdose. An Antidote at Hand. Would Passers-By Use It?
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Across the country, someone dies of an opioid overdose every 24 minutes. In Massachusetts, the death toll is five people a day.
In the face of this epidemic, Cambridge could become the first city to take a step that until recently might have seemed unthinkable: It might place lockboxes on street corners to give the public easy access to Narcan, the brand name for naloxone, a medication that can rapidly revive people who have overdosed.
The idea is in its earliest stages, and any concrete plan for the city, and residents, to consider seems at least a year away. But several days ago, the city police and area doctors who support the boxes conducted an experiment here, asking people who walked by if they would help a stranger who had overdosed.
The officials placed a dummy on the ground on a brick plaza along busy Massachusetts Avenue in Central Square, between two of this city’s most drug-infested areas. Passers-by were asked to pretend they had just found an unconscious person. They were handed a cellphone, which was connected to someone acting as an emergency dispatcher.
The dispatcher directed them to a nearby lockbox, gave them a code to open it and then explained how to administer Narcan, a nasal spray. Doctors say Narcan is safe; if given to someone who has not overdosed, it does no harm. It is not addictive and cannot be abused.
