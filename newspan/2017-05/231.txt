It wasn’t supposed to happen. A year ago, few predicted that the French presidential race would boil down to a matchup between Marine Le Pen, a far-right candidate from a party with a racist, anti-Semitic legacy, and an upstart former banker who had never held elective office, Emmanuel Macron. But here we are.
Voters now face two starkly different choices at the polls on Sunday.
What will become of France if Ms. Le Pen, the anti-immigrant, anti-European Union candidate, defies the polls and vaults into the Élysée Palace? Conversely, what would be in store for a country run by Mr. Macron, her centrist rival?
Here, in their own words — taken from speeches, interviews and campaign platforms — is a window into France’s possible future.
— Ms. Le Pen, after the Champs-Élysées attack, according to CNN. “It is time to stop being naïve,” she told RFI radio, and she has said that if elected, she would deport all foreign citizens on the terrorism watch list.
— Ms. Le Pen, in Nice (which she called a “martyr city of Islamic terrorism”) in April, according to The Washington Post. A man drove a truck into a crowd there in July 2016, killing more than 80 people.
— Ms. Le Pen, on “60 Minutes.” Ms. Le Pen would also ban skullcaps in public, any conspicuous symbol of religious belief, she said.
— Mr. Macron, at a Whirlpool factory in Amiens in April, where Ms. Le Pen upstaged him by bringing treats for workers and posing for selfies. He was booed.
