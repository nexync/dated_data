Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, recused himself, presumably because Mr. Wall, the government lawyer, is his son-in-law. Judge Allyson Kay Duncan, appointed by Mr. Bush, also disqualified herself, without giving a reason.
Next Monday, the Ninth Circuit will hear a separate appeal of another decision blocking aspects of the revised travel ban, from the federal judge in Hawaii. That appeal will be heard by a three-judge panel.
Mr. Wall argued that presidents have vast constitutional and statutory authority over immigration. Under a 1972 Supreme Court immigration decision, he said, judges should not second-guess the government’s “facially legitimate and bona fide reason” for denying visas.
More recently, in a fractured 5-to-4 decision in 2015 with no majority opinion, the Supreme Court refused to second-guess the denial of a visa on national security grounds to the Afghan husband of an American woman. In a concurrence, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said it might be proper to look behind the offered reason for the denial if there was evidence that the consular officer had acted in bad faith.
Mr. Jadwat, the lawyer for the challengers, said Mr. Trump’s statements were evidence of such bad faith. He added that cases claiming religious discrimination require a different analysis from the one courts usually use in immigration cases. In religion cases, he said, motives matter.
