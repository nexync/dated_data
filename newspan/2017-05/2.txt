Flooding across Quebec inundated Montreal and surrounding areas on Sunday and Monday, driving thousands of people out of their homes and washing away at least two people, who remain missing.
The flooding even reached the country’s capital, with hundreds of homes in Ottawa affected and at least 75 families displaced.
Aerial footage in Rigaud, Quebec, west of Montreal, showed whole neighborhoods under water.
Rescue workers transported people on boats in Rigaud.
The flooding in Montreal, which is centered on a group of islands at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers, began when waters breached dikes in the northern part of the city. The authorities declared a state of emergency in Montreal and other affected areas.
Unusually high rainfall in recent weeks has engorged the dams, reservoirs and rivers meant to handle the annual flood season, pushing Lake Ontario to a water level not seen since 1993, the Canadian Press news agency said.
Montreal’s mayor, Denis Coderre, called the flooding a “historic situation” and “a first for our metropolis.” But the city has been prone to occasional flooding during the spring thaw since before Jacques Cartier found an indigenous population occupying the land in the early 1500s. In 1643, the city’s founder, Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, erected the first cross on Mont Royal, the triple-peaked hill that gives the modern city its name, to thank God for saving the fledgling colony from a flood.
