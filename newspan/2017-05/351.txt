Hillary Clinton on Monday announced the launch of Onward Together, a new political group aimed at advancing progressive causes by harnessing grass-roots opposition to President Trump’s policies.
Onward Together is registered as a 501(c)(4) group, the Internal Revenue Service designation for so-called social welfare nonprofits, which are often cited for a rise in dark money in politics because of their ability to protect donor anonymity.
Mrs. Clinton said that Howard Dean, who has been a presidential candidate, the Vermont governor and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, would be involved, though she did not describe what role he would play.
According to a mission statement posted on its website, Onward Together aims to “advance progressive values” by encouraging political engagement.
“There’s no telling what we can achieve if we approach the fights ahead with the passion and determination we feel today, and bring that energy into 2017, 2018, 2020 and beyond,” the statement says.
The Indivisible Project, one of the groups that Mrs. Clinton praised, said it did not plan to receive financial support from Onward Together, but greeted the announcement with gratitude.
“We are so grateful for her assistance in amplifying our reach,” the organization, a network of more than 5,800 local groups, said on Twitter.
The Republican Party criticized Mrs. Clinton’s new group, describing it as simply her old campaign under a new banner.
