Kelly, a former Oregon coach, is joining ESPN as a studio analyst this season. ESPN announced Friday it had signed him to a multiyear deal.
The 53-year-old Kelly spent the past four seasons in the N.F.L., coaching the Philadelphia Eagles for three years and the San Francisco 49ers for one. Kelly was fired by the 49ers after going 2-14 last season. He was 26-21, with a playoff appearance, for the Eagles.
Before jumping to the N.F.L., Kelly spent four seasons as Oregonâ€™s head coach, compiling a 46-7 record. In 2010, Kelly led the Ducks to the Bowl Championship Series title game and was named coach of the year by The Associated Press. He left Oregon as the football program was under investigation by the N.C.A.A. for recruiting violations that led to three years of probation and scholarship reductions.
Kelly will probably be in demand when college head-coaching jobs begin opening after the season. Spending a season or two doing television has been a common path for coaches who are between jobs. Urban Meyer spent a season at ESPN between resigning from Florida and landing at Ohio State. So did Rich Rodriguez after being fired by Michigan and before being hired by Arizona.
Kelly will fill an opening left by Butch Davis, who became the head coach at Florida International.
Kelly was considered one of the most innovative coaches in college football. His up-tempo spread offenses dominated defenses and were mimicked by teams across the country.
