Beginning next month, residents coming home to the new 392-unit rental building at 525 West 52nd Street will be welcomed by a lobby with an interior garden as its centerpiece. Enclosed in glass on three sides, like some giant terrarium, but open to the sky, the inaccessible landscape will sprout with ferns, horsetail and magnolia trees.
Indeed, Future Green Studio has developed a specialty in coaxing plants to grow in unlikely places — in pockets of a sculptural courtyard wall at 520 West 28th Street, for example, and across an indoor green wall at 60 White Street.
“It becomes a big visual feature that lends a softness that makes the space much more human,” said Adrienne Albert, the chief executive of the Marketing Directors, which is leading marketing and leasing at 525 West 52nd Street. “It started with rooftop decks that went from a few plants in pots to really beautiful installations,” she said, “including green walls and sculptural areas” — elements that are now moving indoors.
Sometimes these plantings are combined with water features to create the feeling of an oasis. At 252 East 57th Street, residents traverse a walkway between babbling pools of water to enter the lobby, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Daniel Romualdez and Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects, before encountering a floor-to-ceiling green wall and a long brass table brimming with plants.
At Citizen360 at 360 East 89th Street, there are plans for a green wall by Town & Gardens behind a burnished-steel and oak reception desk, with an integrated scupper that splashes water into a pool. On the floor, stepped slabs of limestone will create the feeling of a rock garden.
