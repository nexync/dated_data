When an officer approached Tiger Woods’s car before his arrest, he was asleep at the wheel, according to the police report released Tuesday.
Woods was arrested and charged with driving under the influence early Monday in Jupiter, Fla. He said in a statement afterward that he had an “unexpected reaction to prescribed medications” and that alcohol was not involved. He also apologized.
Woods’s breathalyzer test for alcohol was negative, a .000.
In the officer’s account, he spotted Woods’s black Mercedes stopped in the right lane. The car was running; its brake lights were on and its right blinker was flashing. Woods, buckled into the driver’s seat, was awakened by the officer.
A Palm Beach County police report shows that Tiger Woods failed a sobriety test on Monday morning, but was not under the influence of alcohol.
Woods seemed confused, saying he did not know where he was and asking how far he was from his house in Hobe Sound. The report noted that Woods was heading away from his house at the time.
Woods, 41, was tested for impairment and did not fare well. In the walking test he “could not maintain starting position. Missed heel to toe each time. Stepped off line several times.” He also struggled with the one-leg stand and finger to nose.
Asked if he understood instructions to recite the alphabet backwards he replied, “Yes, recite entire National Anthem backward.” He did eventually complete that task.
Woods said he was on several medications, including Vicodin, a pain reliever, according to the report, first obtained by The Palm Beach Post.
Woods agreed to take a urine test, but the results were not immediately available. He was given a court date of July 5.
After 16 months off because of back problems, he returned in December. But by February, back spasms caused him to stop playing again. He had a back operation in April.
