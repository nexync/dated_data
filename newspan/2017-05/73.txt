The head of President Trump’s re-election campaign accused CNN of “censorship” on Tuesday afternoon after the broadcast network refused to run the group’s latest advertisement.
CNN said it would run the 30-second television spot, a celebration of Mr. Trump’s first 100 days in office, only if the campaign removed a section that featured the words “fake news” superimposed over several TV journalists, including Wolf Blitzer of CNN, and others from MSNBC, PBS, ABC and CBS.
CNN defended the decision in a statement on Twitter.
In the advertisement, a narrator claims that “America has rarely seen such success,” before listing several purported achievements from Mr. Trump’s first 100 days in office.
“You wouldn’t know it from watching the news,” he says, before the words “fake news” are briefly displayed.
Kyle Pope, the editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review, said news organizations often set standards both in the advertisements they choose to air or publish and in what they cover.
“It’s totally within their rights to set ground rules with how they deal with this administration,” he said of CNN.
“It’s telling here that this is in a political ad by the political campaign because it’s increasingly clear that this ‘fake news’ mantra is a political maneuver more than anything,” he said.
