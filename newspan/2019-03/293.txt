No woman is responsible for harassment or any other violent act against her. But experienced travelers and government agencies show how to travel as safely as possible.
On Tuesday, Google unveiled a Doodle in honor of Chen Mao Ping, the renowned Chinese-born author known as Sanmao, on what would have been her 76th birthday. She traveled the globe and wrote of her adventures, inspiring generations of women to see the world beyond their own homes.
Sanmao died in 1991 in Taiwan, but it’s not hard to imagine that while traveling she had encountered some risk, as many women who travel today do.
After the publication of a New York Times article about the dangers women face while traveling alone — a thread in a broader fabric of harassment and violence — readers had lots of suggestions about how to keep women safe. Jessica Nabongo, who appeared in the article, says she stays in hotels with 24-hour security or in Airbnbs that have achieved Superhost status. She tries to always take Ubers so that her location is tracked, especially at night.
Paramount among the suggestions were calls for men to be allies.
Many readers noted that men can do much to help women — and others — who travel alone by simply not ignoring the bad behavior of others. If something seems amiss, check on another traveler, and if need be, intervene safely or alert the authorities.
Below are other suggestions.

Many women said they practiced self-defense tactics like martial arts. But they also said that above all: Heed your gut; trust your instincts. Carry pepper spray, a pocketknife, a laptop or anything that can be used as a weapon or to summon help.
There’s nothing to lose by going on group tours or guided excursions. Others also stressed the same tactics they used at home: not walking alone in the dark, never taking a drink you haven’t seen poured and being aware of the “friendly” stranger.
Some women suggested carrying two phones in case one is stolen. Others said to divide up your belongings and your cash in case you’re robbed, so that you do not lose everything.
Free applications like Chirpey, RedZone, MayDay, Tripwhistle and Noonlight let women flag incidents and areas of danger, and show how to contact local law enforcement.
“Be prepared to be bombarded as you step off the bus, train, or out of the airport. These can be some of the most intense moments of solo travel. It’s good to already know what you want and where you are going next. If you don’t, then just walk away a short distance, observe, and take a little time to get your bearings before making a decision.
— Kelsi Lyon, 37, Portland, Ore. Has traveled to India, Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Philippines, Spain, France and Italy.
“In moments between the wonder, awe and privilege of traveling through the world, I have been followed and harassed by men who assume I’m a sex worker, not a solo black female traveler simply trying to see a bit of the world.
— Martha Mukaiwa, 33, Windhoek, Namibia. Has traveled to Thailand, Malaysia, Ghana, Indonesia, Germany, France and Italy.
“I will often hire a local guide to accompany me:you are far less likely to be trifled with when you are with one. They speak the language and pave the way.
“I tip at hotels as soon as I get there in countries with a high poverty rate. Concierge, desk, servers, maids and luggage, I give to them all. That way if I need a rescue or anything else, I am covered. This has often paid off for me.
— Caroline Vroom, 63, Sarasota, Fla. I have traveled to South America, Europe, Asia, Egypt — 75 countries. Not always alone. But alone quite a lot. I sometimes prefer it.
Many governments issue travel advisories for other countries for their citizens. The State Department, for example, publishes a list of safety levels by country. Its website, Travel.State.Gov, has information on every country and contact information for the closest American Embassy or Consulate.
The State Department also has advice specifically for female travelers, and other groups.
Consider enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, a.k.a. STEP, or its equivalent in your country.
Unicef has data on violence indicators that may be telling for travelers, including domestic violence, female genital mutilation and female homicide. The World Bank has a gender data portal that provides statistics that can signal to women whether it’s a safe location over all.
“Try to stay in places where other travelers are staying, i.e. try not to stay in a place where you are the only guest. Try to be sure you can lock your door when you go to sleep. As useless as this may seem, I have even locked the zippers of my tent together and slept with the key in my hand.
— Elena Steigman, 41, Valencia, Spain. Has traveled to Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Greece, an army base in Lebanon at the Lebanon-Israel border, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, Austria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Germany, Croatia, Spain, the Netherlands, Scotland, Denmark, Italy, France, Poland and Portugal.
— Juliet DeMasi, 25, Providence, R.I. Has traveled to Canada, Washington, D.C., New York, Iceland, London, France. Italy, Greece, Thailand and Australia.
“Don’t be afraid of publicly shaming someone who is harassing you. If you suddenly find yourself in a dangerous neighborhood or situation, be erratic, drool, laugh out loud and mutter to yourself. These are all things I’ve done while traveling by myself all around the world for the past 35 years.
— Amanda Franzoni, 49, Portland, Ore. I’ve been traveling by myself all around the world for the past 35 years. Japan, China, Italy, England, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Panama, Canada, Mexico and the United States, including Puerto Rico.
 Personally, I’d like to see a list of ‘appropriate male travel behaviors’ also added to these websites. Women are taught from the beginning that the world is a scary place for us. This construct desperately needs to change if equality is ever to be possible.
“Here are some of my tips: Pay for your safety even if it means spending a bit more. Take an Uber, stay in centralized accommodations and buy a local SIM card so your mobile works internationally.
“If there are other solo female travelers around, introduce yourself to them, as you will naturally look out for one another along the way and make a new friend.
— Heather-Rose Cahill, 36, London. I have traveled as a solo female to 16 countries spanning three continents: Vietnam, Cuba, Montenegro, Malta, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Cambodia, the Netherlands and Scotland.
Correction: An earlier version of this article misquoted a woman who described her experiences being followed or harassed while traveling alone. She said she has been followed and harassed by men who assume she is "a sex worker," not "a prostitute."
