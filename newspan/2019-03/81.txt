We can finally put a name to the thing striking fear within the health care establishment: Haven.
The secretive new venture, created by corporate titans Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to transform health care for their employees, has gone without an official name for more than a year.
The name “reflects our goal to be a partner to individuals and families and help them get the care they need, while working with clinicians and others to make the overall system better for all,” according to the website.
It also features a letter from the chief executive, Dr. Atul Gawande, a well-known surgeon who writes for The New Yorker, saying the venture will advocate for patients.
Executives of Haven were not available for interviews. But in spite of its fuzzy new name and the talk of working with anyone who wants to help, Dr. Gawande underscored that the three employers are frustrated with the current system and are determined to make significant changes.
Employees may feel reassured, but some of the major players in the health care industry are likely to remain very unsettled.
