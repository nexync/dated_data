What’s Your Favorite Watch Podcast?
Podcasts have become very popular. According to “The Infinite Dial Study 2019,” published this month by the New Jersey-based Edison Research and Triton Digital, a Los Angeles digital audio technology company, more than 50 percent of all Americans older than 12 have listened to a podcast — and one-third of the population, or about 90 million, had listened to one within the past month. Even as online listening reached a high, social media usage stalled: The study found that the percentage of Americans who used Facebook had dropped to 61 percent from 67 percent in 2017, a decline of about 15 million people.
The watch industry has been picking up on this. In the last couple of years, a new breed of horology podcasts has popped up, created by online magazines, retailers and independent voices. And some have been reporting strong listening numbers.
The owners of Hodkinee Radio, the podcast from the online watch resource Hodkinee, said that since its introduction in July 2018, their podcasts had been downloaded more than 1.2 million times.
So which watch podcasts do some of the watch industry’s most influential voices favor? Here are their replies, which were edited and condensed.
