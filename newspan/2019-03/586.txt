For months, the British authorities have released quite a bit of information about the poisoning and the evidence indicating who carried it out and how. In September, the Crown Prosecution Service charged two men, identified as officers in Russiaâ€™s military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U., with attempted murder, conspiracy and possession of a nerve agent. The men were identified by the aliases they used on their Russian passports, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.
