A severe measles outbreak has been plaguing New York since October, with hundreds of confirmed cases both in the city and suburban Rockland County, prompting officials to spring into action.
New York City issued an emergency order in December, demanding that some schools prohibit students who were not vaccinated against measles from attending classes.
And in an extraordinary step, Rockland County on Tuesday barred unvaccinated children from public places for 30 days.
Here’s what you need to know about measles in New York today.
There have been 214 confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens since October, according to the city’s health department.
In Williamsburg, 161 cases have been confirmed; in Borough Park, there have been 47. The remaining cases have been in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Midwood, Marine Park, Bensonhurst and Brighton Beach, and in Flushing, Queens.
The county, which is north of New York City and has a population of more than 300,000, has had 155 confirmed cases since October, according to its Health Department.
Are these cases linked?
The outbreak in both places has mostly affected ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities and is associated with travelers who brought back measles from Israel, where the disease is spreading.
Lower vaccination rates and anti-vaccination information are also contributing to the wave of cases, public officials say.
Measles is among the most contagious of the infectious diseases. It killed 110,000 people globally in 2017, mostly children younger than 5.
In some cases, measles can lead to pneumonia, permanent deafness and brain damage.
People may show no symptoms up to two weeks after being infected.
At first, the signs of measles can appear benign — a moderate fever, cough, sore throat or runny nose. Later, a fever may reach 104 or 105 degrees, and the telltale red dots can appear on the skin.
Measles is transmitted by droplets from an infected person’s nose or mouth. The virus can live in the airspace where the person has breathed, coughed or sneezed.
How safe and effective is the measles vaccine?
The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is extremely safe and effective. The vast majority of people who contract measles have not been vaccinated.
It does not cause autism.
If I choose not to vaccinate my child, why should anyone else care?
An unvaccinated child can get the virus and spread it to those who can’t protect themselves. Infants and people with compromised immune systems cannot get vaccines.
Vaccination rates are down worldwide. Public health officials are fighting back, repeatedly pointing out that medical and scientific evidence confirms that vaccines are safe. Still, dangerous misinformation is proliferating.
“This feels like a very real-world manifestation of what can happen when you’re in an echo chamber,” said The Times’s Michael Gold, who has reported on the recent outbreak.
It’s Opening Day, and 50 years ago the Mets started their improbable run to the World Series championship. Here was a group of players who had stumbled all over the place in 1962, with fans who embraced them almost in defiance. A team that slowly improved in the years that followed, and figured it all out for one intensely memorable season.

March Madness brackets aren’t just for basketball. They’re for pizza slices. The name of the year. And one-liners.
• Sixty-four comedians compete. Two are onstage at a time, and each tells a one-line joke.
• The audience laughs (or boos — this is Brooklyn, after all), and judges decide who advances to the next round.
The contest lasts about 90 minutes, and there are lots of jokes flying around — from the competitors, Ms. Winter and even the musician who performs between rounds.
The sets are short. No context is needed.
“I’ve never thrown a bad one,” Ms. Winter said about the show, adding that it’s usually a hit, even if the one-liners aren’t.
The show starts at 8 p.m. at the Bell House in Brooklyn. Tickets are $15.

It’s tough in this town when you haven’t a nest.
When the trees are all bare and the temper’ture’s brutal.
