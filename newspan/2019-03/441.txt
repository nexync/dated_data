WASHINGTON â€” A federal judge on Monday rejected a request that he speed up consideration of a lawsuit filed on behalf of Hoda Muthana, an American-born woman who joined the Islamic State group in 2014 and is now stranded in a refugee camp in Syria with her 18-month-old son, the child of a slain ISIS fighter.
