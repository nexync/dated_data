For the first time, over a dozen top aides — from the speaker’s national security adviser to the majority whip’s chief of staff — are racial minorities.
Ms. Pelosi, who is white, hired Ms. Hendrix to lead the House Democratic Diversity Initiative when she was House minority leader last Congress. Now that Democrats are in the majority, Ms. Hendrix assists all House offices with improving their hiring practices and creating a pipeline of diverse aides. In addition to fielding questions and conducting one-on-one sessions with offices, she oversees a resume bank curated in collaboration with the Democratic Caucus that helps pull in candidates from traditionally neglected networks, such as historically black colleges.
