WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled against sailors injured in the 2000 bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen by Qaeda operatives, saying the sailors had failed to serve their legal papers properly in a lawsuit against the government of Sudan. The decision threw out a $314 million default judgment, though the court said the sailors should be able to pursue further litigation.
The attack killed 17 American sailors and injured dozens more. Fifteen of the injured sailors and three of their spouses sued Sudan by delivering a copy of their suit to its embassy in Washington. The suit said Sudan had harbored and supported Osama bin Laden and other members of Al Qaeda in the years before the bombing.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for eight members of the court, said the language of the statute required sending the legal papers to the foreign ministry in Sudan rather than Sudan’s embassy in Washington.
“A foreign nation’s embassy in the United States is neither the residence nor the usual place of business of that nation’s foreign minister and is not a place where the minister can customarily be found,” Justice Alito wrote.
That was the position pressed by the Trump administration, which filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Sudan.
Justice Alito wrote that the court’s ruling “is not the end of the road,” as the sailors may still serve their suit on the foreign ministry.
