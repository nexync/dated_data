What roles do sound and silence play in our lives?
“Sanctuaries of Silence” is a seven-minute 360-video that touches on themes of nature, listening and the power of silence. It profiles Gordon Hempton, an acoustic ecologist, as he travels from noisy city streets to the Hoh Rain Forest in western Washington State in search of quiet. He believes that silence — which he defines as the absence of noise from daily life — is crucial for humans’ well-being, and that it is on the verge of extinction.
Listening through a microphone taught Mr. Hempton to take things in with equal value, without judgment. We were struck by this approach, as it offered us the opportunity to be completely present in the landscape. When listening in this way, we were more connected to the space around us. We heard the intricacies of life — the creaking of trees, the cacophony of birdsong. We were attuned to nature in ways we had not experienced.
Our hope with this film is that viewers come away with a new perspective toward sound and the power of silence. The simple act of listening to the natural world can have a profound impact on our relationship to place and on ourselves by rooting us in a presence that we no longer take for granted.
