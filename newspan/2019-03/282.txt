An anti-immigration lawmaker in Australia who has been criticized for blaming Muslim immigration for Friday’s New Zealand shootings struck a teenager who smashed an egg on his head in Melbourne on Saturday.
In video footage on the Facebook page of the senator, Fraser Anning, the teenager can be seen approaching him as Mr. Anning speaks to reporters in a southeastern suburb of Melbourne. The teenager raises a mobile phone in one hand and smashes the egg on the back of Mr. Anning’s head with the other.
Mr. Anning turns and swiftly strikes the young man in the face twice. A scuffle ensues in which other men tackle the teenager to the ground while swearing at him. The video shows them holding the teenager on the ground in a chokehold until police officers arrive.
A police spokesman said officers had arrested a 17-year-old man at the scene and later released him pending further inquiries. Local news outlets later identified the teenager as Will Connolly.
His remarks drew condemnation across the political spectrum.
“These comments are appalling and they’re ugly and they have no place in Australia,” said Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, according to the ABC, the national broadcaster.
Mr. Anning, 69, who was elected as a senator from Queensland in 2017, is known for his anti-immigration views and inflammatory remarks.
