Would you be interested in speaking to other readers — even those who might disagree with your views?
Gun violence is a real fear in the minds of many Americans. For others, the right to bear arms is one of the most fundamental enshrined in the Constitution. Little surprise, then, that the issue has become a point of contention in Congress and beyond.
We’re looking for readers to participate in a thoughtful conversation on gun policy in America as part of a project featuring a series of such conversations on important issues facing the country. We welcome and encourage all voices and points of view as long as they include an openness to respectfully discussing this issue with others.
  Do you collect guns, but support a national registry? We want to hear from a diversity of voices in this debate.
