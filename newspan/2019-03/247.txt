A doctor recalls a young boy’s question about masculinity.
Years ago, when I was still practicing pediatrics, I was doing a yearly exam on a 9-year-old. He was telling me how strong he was getting to be.
Without stopping to consider, I answered, “Johnny, to be a man, you have to be strong enough to be gentle.” The adult answer confused the child, but as so often happens, the immediate, spontaneous answer found the truth.
I realized that it was now my responsibility to remember what this child had pulled out of me. When told about it, a minister friend broke into a big smile and nodded.
