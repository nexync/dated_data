Because of a production error, an article on Monday about similarities in data recovered from “black boxes” of a jetliner that crashed in Ethiopia and one involving the same Boeing model in Indonesia five months earlier, was missing part of a sentence. Because of the error, the sentence misstated the number of people who died in the Ethiopia crash. It was 157, not 57.
An article on Saturday about student reactions to a college admissions scandal misstated the number of articles that the Yale Daily News published this week about the university’s connection to the scandal. It was three, not one.
An article on Monday about so-called opportunity zones created in the 2017 tax law, misstated the surname of the chief executive of Virtua Partners. She is Quinn Palomino, not Palombo. The surname of the mayor also was misspelled. He is Kenn Weise, not Weiss.
An article on Monday about the box office numbers for “Captain Marvel” omitted the name of a distributor of “Five Feet Apart.” The movie is distributed by Lionsgate and CBS Films, not just Lionsgate.
An article on Dec. 14 about The Times’s art critics’ favorite art books of 2018 misidentified the publisher of “Hairy Who? 1966-1969.” It is the Art Institute of Chicago, not Yale University Press. This correction was delayed because it was only recently brought to the attention of the editors.
