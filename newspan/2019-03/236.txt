Danny Boyle’s musical comedy “Yesterday” will have its world premiere on the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival this year, organizers announced Thursday. The film, about an opportunistic guitarist who finds himself to be the only person who remembers the Beatles after a worldwide blackout, will screen May 4.
Earlier that day, the festival will celebrate the 25th anniversary of Ben Stiller’s Generation X dramedy, “Reality Bites,” followed by a conversation with Stiller and the actors Ethan Hawke, Winona Ryder, Janeane Garofalo and Steve Zahn.
The festival will also commemorate the 40th anniversary of Francis Ford Coppola’s Vietnam War epic “Apocalypse Now” with a new restoration.
Among the other movies featured in the festival are “Between Me and My Mind,” about Trey Anastasio, the frontman of Phish, and the documentary “The Good, The Bad, The Hungry,” about the Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in Coney Island.
This year’s edition runs April 24-May 5. For more information, go to tribecafilm.com.
