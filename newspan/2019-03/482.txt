Science|Space Is Very Big. Some of Its New Explorers Will Be Tiny.
Last year, two satellites the size of cereal boxes sped toward Mars as though they were on an invisible track in space. Officially called MarCO A and MarCO B, they were nicknamed Wall-E and EVE, after the animated robots from the Pixar movie, by engineers at NASA.
Constellations of small satellites like the MarCOs now orbit Earth, used by scientists, private companies, high school students and even governments seeking low-budget eyes in the skies. But never before had a cubesat traveled 300 million miles into space.
The engineers even managed to get around one of the trickier issues with how to collect data and talk to the cubesats. Typically, when a spacecraft calls home, it will spend several hours using NASA’s Deep Space Network, the very expensive phone system for calls beyond the moon.
As it passed Mars, MarCO B returned the first photo ever taken of Mars from a cubesat. It revealed the copper-colored entirety of the planet in the dark of space, and a small section of the spacecraft’s antenna.
