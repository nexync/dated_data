She and her colleagues think that fuel burned by ships in Vancouver’s harbor, as well as emissions from cars in the city’s streets, might be sources of the lead. Going forward, scientists might be able to track improvements or declines in air quality over time by monitoring the beehives and analyzing the honey.
