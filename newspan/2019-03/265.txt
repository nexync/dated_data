Bee writes: When I was young, my parents made me terrified of marijuana. They told me if I tried it, the next step was cocaine addiction. Now my parents are in their 60s, and they’re stoned every night on edibles. They once ate Skittles for dinner; it bums me out. Am I right to be concerned about how they’ve decided to live?
All parents are hypocrites, but yours owe you an apology. They were under the influence of intense, ’80s antidrug propaganda that did nothing to address addiction and just made parents paranoid. That was a bad drug. Now they are on a better drug, at the precise time in their lives when it will do the least harm. So long as they stay within the law and off the roads, I will not grant you your (deserved) revenge. They are just having fun and easing the fear of dying. But here’s my P.S.A.: Don’t do drugs with your parents. That would be weird.
