Waiting for the Mueller report.
After nearly two years, 34 indictments or guilty pleas, and countless angry presidential tweets, the Mueller report, we are told, could be winding down.
When Robert Mueller finally sends his findings to the attorney general, what will we do? It depends, in part, on when that happens. For some big stories that have broken outside our typical production schedule — like on a Friday — we’ve put out special editions, a kind of emergency show. We did that when President Trump fired Steve Bannon, his closest White House adviser; when Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I.; and when the president bragged to Russian diplomats about firing F.B.I. director James Comey, saying it would take the heat off the Russia investigation.
We don’t yet know when the report will land, but we’ve approached this story feeling that our greatest responsibility is to set the right expectations. That’s why we did something we’ve never done before: a series of explanatory episodes designed to set the table for the Mueller report — how its release could happen (or not happen), what it might conclude (or not conclude), and what it would trigger next (or not trigger next).
The series is called “What to Expect When You’re Expecting (the Mueller Report),” a nod to Heidi Murkoff and Sharon Mazel’s ubiquitous parenting guide. It began with an explanation of rules surrounding the report’s handoff from the special counsel to the attorney general. It then explored Mueller’s options for recommending charges against President Trump, and concluded with the role of Congress’s oversight committees.
The worst thing we, as journalists, can do in moments like this is leave you unprepared to process a historic moment. We hope that if you listen to the series, you’ll feel ready for what the next few days, weeks and months will bring.
