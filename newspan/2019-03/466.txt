Music|Can Michael Jackson’s Legacy Ever Really Be Derailed?
 How do fans process them, and Jackson’s body of work?
Earlier this week, HBO aired the two-part documentary “Leaving Neverland,” which details accusations of child sexual abuse against Michael Jackson from two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck.
The film has had deep reverberations. Oprah Winfrey came out in support of the accusers, interviewing them for a television special. And the conversation around the film has placed Jackson in the cross hairs of several ongoing conversations about how culture made by people accused of heinous crimes will be dealt with in the future. The film is likely to have an impact on the value of his estate, and the way any future Jackson projects unfold. At the same time, Michael Jackson superfans have been pushing back against the film, suggesting it amounts to little more than rumor.
