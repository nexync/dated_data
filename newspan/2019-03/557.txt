Robert De Niro, the most famous co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival, will sit down with his frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese during this year’s Tribeca Talks series, the festival announced Tuesday.
De Niro has appeared in nine films directed by Scorsese, including “Taxi Driver” and “Goodfellas.” They will reunite in another crime drama — “The Irishman” — this fall.
The series will bring together other collaborative duos, like the director David O. Russell and the actress Jennifer Lawrence, who have worked together on “Silver Linings Playbook,” “American Hustle” and “Joy.” The actress and rapper Queen Latifah will also make an appearance alongside the director Dee Rees in a conversation ahead of the premiere of two short documentaries by the Queen Collective, a program Queen Latifah helped develop to amplify gender and racial equality in filmmaking.
Other notable stars featured in the series include Guillermo Del Toro, Sarah Silverman and Michael J. Fox. This year’s festival runs April 24-May 5. For more information, go to tribecafilm.com.
