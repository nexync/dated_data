Jerry Winfield Bradshaw and Gerald Joseph Golski were married March 19 at the Botanical Gardens at Asheville in North Carolina. Michael DeSerio, affiliated with the American Fellowship Church, officiated.
Mr. Bradshaw (left), 66, retired as an associate professor of nursing at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland. Until 2007, he was a pediatric intensive care nurse at Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital at University Hospital in Cleveland. He graduated from Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio, and received a doctor of nursing degree from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
He is the son of the late Vera J. Bradshaw and the late Charles W. Bradshaw, who lived in Avon Park, Fla. His mother was a saleswoman of sewing machines and vacuum cleaners at Sears in Sandusky, Ohio. His father was a precision grinder at the Ford Motor Company there.
Mr. Golski, 67, also known as Jerry, retired as a sales manager at the Cleveland Orchestra, where he was responsible for concert sales at Severance Hall and the Blossom Music Center. He graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio.
He is a son of the late Sophie M. Golski and the late Dominic A. Golski, who lived in Elyria, Ohio. His mother was a waitress at Stouffer’s restaurant in Fairview Park, Ohio. His father was the manager of the meat department at South End Eagle Market, a grocery store that was in Elyria.
The couple were introduced online at the end of 2002 after Mr. Bradshaw responded to a question Mr. Golski posed in his dating profile: “Do you want to meet someone to make your life interesting?” Once they met for Chinese food in a Cleveland suburb months later, in April, they wasted no time in starting a relationship. Within a year they became known as the Jerrys, and said these days what makes their lives more interesting are their two rescue dachshunds, Ava and Spencer.
