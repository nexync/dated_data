Now Lives In a one-bedroom apartment in the East Village, with a living room that has been converted into a multipurpose studio.
Big Break In 2007, while a student at Pratt Institute, he became one of the original members of the Still House Group, a buzzed-about art collective based in Manhattan and then Brooklyn. (It disbanded last year.) “My artwork is primarily about individuals, subcultures and microcosms,” Mr. Greer said. After college, Opening Ceremony and Nike asked him to stitch his signature scribbles on varsity jackets and denim. “You could tell me you wanted a picture of a whale smoking a bong surfing and I would render it in embroidery,” he said.
Next Thing Mr. Greer is looking to shop his latest documentary, “Circles in Tompkins Square,” on the film festival circuit or as a DVD at art bookstores. Shot over five months in 2016, the hourlong film is his homage to the diversity of life in the iconic East Village park. The film can also be rented on Vimeo. “I don’t make these things for them to be silent,” he said.
Repo Man Other people’s garbage is Mr. Greer’s gold. Many of his textural art pieces, which have been exhibited at White Cube in London and Rodolphe Janssen in Brussels, are an assemblage of scraps left on the floor by his old studio mates. “I recycle other people’s mistakes and figure out a way to use that range of color, texture and material to reconstruct images of my own,” he said.
