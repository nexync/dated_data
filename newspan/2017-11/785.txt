Say your lines over and over again. “What you definitely don’t want to do is to get bored,” O’Hanlon says. Keep things lively with a little game she calls “as if.” Imagine you’re learning the balcony scene in which Romeo says: “But, soft! What light through yonder window breaks?”  “Give yourself lots of these ‘as ifs,’ ” O’Hanlon says. Another technique is to go through the lines emphasizing the emotion in the vowels and then again focusing just on the cerebral crispness of the consonants.
