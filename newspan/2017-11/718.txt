How many B+ comedies — fairly funny, reasonably clever, ultimately disposable — can the television ecosystem support? New ones keep popping up in every area, from the networks (“The Mayor”) to the cablers (“SMILF”) to the wilds of YouTube Red (“Ryan Hansen Solves Crimes on Television”). They’re even more kudzu-like than noirish thrillers.
In case your memory doesn’t stretch back to the 1984 “Last Starfighter,” “Future Man” stars Josh Hutcherson (himself a reference to “The Hunger Games”) as a janitor named Josh who lives with his parents and distracts himself from his millennial malaise by obsessively playing a violent, futuristic video game. When he finally unlocks the last level, two of the game’s characters, Tiger and Wolf (Eliza Coupe and Derek Wilson), appear in his bedroom and tell him that the game was a test sent back from the post-apocalyptic future to find humanity’s savior.
Like the film, “Future Man” is sophomoric and subtle by turns. Josh cleans the toilets at a lab that’s seeking a cure for herpes — a project connected to the future doom of the human race — and one running joke involves the swabbing of possum urethras. But a lot of the humor is more sophisticated, involving Tiger and Wolf’s ignorance of the accouterments of civilization — money, love, babies — and Josh’s superior, sci-fi-geek’s knowledge of the rules of time travel.
