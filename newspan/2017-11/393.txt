— From the song “Ivory Coast,” on Destroyer’s new album, “Ken” (Merge Records, Oct. 20, 2017).
Destroyer is a one-man indie band designed to pleasantly disorient people. Dan Bejar, a bushy-haired Canadian, sings like a lounge singer who wants to confuse the lounge — to make the actual walls and curtains and chairs and ashtrays exchange meaningful looks with one another.
His lyrics are collages of everyday language. Almost anything will do: clichés, film titles, even old lyrics from classic rock hits. (“You can go your own way!” he belts out in one song, with total conviction, as if he were the very first person ever to think to sing it.) Bejar’s genius is to assemble all of these fragments in ways that are interestingly wrong, with the normal handles and switches and on-ramps and offramps of human language removed. The average Destroyer song is lit up frequently by disjunction: the little sparks that pop out when one order of logic gets rammed into another. “A thorn in my side told me, ‘Hold, please,’ ” Bejar sings on his new album, stapling the New Testament to a customer-service script.
Often, Destroyer’s artifice requires only the tiniest twist. “Good things come to those who wait” is a saying so presynaptically familiar that our minds hardly even need to finish the sentence — we just take the comfort and run. But Bejar adds an extra word — “forever” — which undercuts the saying’s meaning. It’s impossible to wait forever, of course. So good things will not come. The cliché self-destructs upon delivery.
This line comes toward the end of the song, which means that we have to wait for it — not forever, but for nearly three minutes — and Bejar sings it over and over and over and over and over. The song’s payoff is that there’s no such thing as a payoff.
