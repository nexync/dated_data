President Trump may have graduated from the Wharton School but he either skipped international economics or failed to pay attention. The age-old concept of comparative advantage teaches that in most cases both parties to a transaction derive benefits from trading with each other those products and services in which each has a comparative cost advantage.
Mistakenly, Mr. Trump thinks that every deal is a zero-sum game and that what one party gains is at the expense of the other. Nor has he learned about most-favored-nation treatment, which gives reduced tariffs to all signer nations. In the postwar period, this clause has promoted international trade on a vast scale and thereby raised living standards around the world.
By adhering to the false notion of trade as a zero-sum deal, Mr. Trump becomes a job killer rather than a job creator.

So if President Trump respects other governments for putting their countries first, and if trade is a zero-sum game, how will trade negotiators ever be able to agree on anything?
