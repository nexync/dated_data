The connection between Jews and chocolate goes beyond Hanukkah gelt. Jewish refugees were instrumental in establishing chocolate companies in America, and before that, they were chocolatiers in France, Austria and other countries. An exhibition of artifacts and other materials sheds light on this history: “On Jews and Chocolate,” Sundays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., to Feb. 25, 2018; Herbert and Eileen Bernard Museum of Judaica, Temple Emanu-El, 1 East 65th Street (Fifth Avenue), |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , extension 259, emanuelnyc.org/museum.php.
