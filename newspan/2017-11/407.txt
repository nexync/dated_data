The Yankees interviewed the broadcaster Aaron Boone for their managerial job on Friday. He was the fourth candidate to have met with the team.
Boone, 44, a former Yankees third baseman who hit the home run that won the 2003 American League Championship Series for them, has never managed or coached professionally.
