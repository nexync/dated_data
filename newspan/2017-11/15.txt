Consumers in 45 states buy wine directly from wineries and ship it to their homes, and the wineries that ship say business has never been better. For the most part, this activity is legal and in full compliance with state and federal regulations.
But out-of-state retailer shipping is problematic. Courts, legislatures and state regulators have consistently determined that because retailers are licensed and regulated differently from wineries, there is no way to effectively monitor, regulate and hold them accountable.
Unlike wineries, retailers are licensed only at the state level and with no federal oversight over thousands of them.
The bigger challenge is looming competition: Apps like Drizly (a partner of Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America) and its competitors arm the countryâ€™s best wine sales people (independent local retailers) with the tools to source and home-deliver the world of wine, beer and spirits on demand.
The primary state authority regulatory structure of our industry is a critical reason the market is safe, virtually free from counterfeit and adulterated products, and operates in a safe and responsible manner.
