“The Wolves,” which opened in September 2016, has reopened at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, Manhattan; |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , lct.org. Here are excerpts from Ben Brantley’s review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 12, 2016.
The scary, exhilarating brightness of raw adolescence emanates from every scene of “The Wolves,” the uncannily assured first play by Sarah DeLappe, and at times your instinct is to shade your eyes.
Then again, that might block the view of some of the most exciting and affecting ensemble work on a New York stage. With the director Lila Neugebauer marshaling rampant teen spirit into balletic unity, this pulsating portrait of a girls’ soccer team at times brings to mind a nine-headed hydra, rushing at you on a stream of exploding hormones.
Yes, there are nine major characters in “The Wolves” who are in their middle teens. (The only adult doesn’t appear until near the end.) And for long stretches, it feels as if they’re all talking at once. This production uses overlapping dialogue the way Robert Altman did in his films, to create a heady buzz of personalities in collision; it forces you to retune your ears and find the order in seemingly chaotic conversation.
Ms. DeLappe’s dialogue isn’t just true to the jargon of a certain age in a particular place; it also varies in subtle but sharp ways from character to character. As we listen and try to make sense of the torrent of words, each young woman emerges by degrees as a completely defined self.
