Both Bush Presidents Worry Trump Is Blowing Up the G.O.P.
WASHINGTON — President Trump is not a favorite in the extended Bush household. Former President George Bush considers him a “blowhard,” only interested in feeding his own ego. Former President George W. Bush, his son, thinks Mr. Trump fans public anger and came to office without any understanding of the job.
The White House fired back with a statement on Saturday arguing that American voters chose an outsider to change a system of lifelong politicians beholden to special interests. “If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.
