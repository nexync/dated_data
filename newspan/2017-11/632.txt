Mr. Tolk, his son said, was born in Brooklyn and worked in the garment industry for years before it collapsed, inspecting women’s sweaters before they were shipped to retailers like Walmart and Target. The family lost their home in West New York, N.J., in 2010, and Mr. Tolk stayed behind while his wife moved west to be closer to their sons, Andrew and Prescott, Andrew Tolk said.
Although he maintained a Post Office box in West New York, Mr. Tolk lived with his aunt in Brooklyn, his son said. He borrowed a car to make a living driving for Uber, work that his son said he hated but that allowed him to remain in New York.
“His passion was the garment industry, and he loved New York,” Andrew Tolk said.
