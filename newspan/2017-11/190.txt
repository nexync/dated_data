Understanding the tax plan.
• Business is the big winner in the $1.5 trillion overhaul of the tax code the House unveiled on Thursday, though the bill offers modest savings for middle-class families. We compiled six charts to explain the plan.
The architects of the bill said it would deliver a tax break of $1,182 a year to a family of four earning $59,000 a year. How would it affect your taxes? It’s too soon to predict, writes our personal finance columnist, Ron Lieber, but the benefits to the middle class may be fleeting.

Clocks fall back an hour in most of the U.S. and Canada on Sunday — after having done so last week in Europe — with the end of daylight saving time. Clocks in parts of Australia have moved, too, in the opposite direction.
Historians have traced the notion for daylight saving time to Benjamin Franklin, who realized he was sleeping through some daylight hours while visiting Paris in the 18th century.
But the first plan to actually move the clock hands came from William Willett, who unsuccessfully proposed daylight saving time to the British Parliament in 1908. Germany, seeking cost savings during World War I, heard the idea and enacted it in 1915. Three weeks later, the British followed, and other world powers were close behind, including the U.S. in 1918.
“I don’t know how that ever became a myth, but it is the exact opposite,” he said.
