With books in the works (or already published) by political analysts and reporters, the Obamas and the Bidens, as well as other major players, no stone is likely to be left unturned in the analysis of the 2016 presidential election and President Donald J. Trump’s presidency. On Tuesday, Bill Thomas, the editor in chief of Doubleday, announced another voice to the mix: New Yorker writer and legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.
“This is the book that Jeff Toobin was born to write,” said Mr. Thomas in a statement.
The project will cover special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials in an attempt to skew election results.
Mr. Toobin’s other books, which include “The Run of His Life: The People vs. O.J. Simpson,” the basis for the acclaimed FX series starring Cuba Gooding Jr., and, most recently, “American Heiress: The Wild Saga of the Kidnapping, Crimes and Trial of Patty Hearst,” “have taken complex legal subjects and drawn out the characters and drama — as well as humor — that make the stories compelling,” said Mr. Thomas, who will edit the title.
Other writers are also delving into the particulars of the Russia probe and President Trump’s administration. Luke Harding, a foreign correspondent for The Guardian, will release “Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win” this week, and Michael Wolff is working on “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” an up close look at the current administration based on interviews with Mr. Trump and many members of his senior staff.
No publication date or title has been determined for Mr. Toobin’s project.
