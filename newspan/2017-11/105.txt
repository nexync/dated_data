Art & Design|Is It Possible That the Eisenhower Memorial Will Finally Get Built?
Members of three generations of the Eisenhower family took part in the groundbreaking, as well as members of the bipartisan Eisenhower Memorial Commission, and the memorial’s designer, Frank Gehry.
Susan Eisenhower, a granddaughter who had once been a fierce critic of the Gehry design, was among the speakers.
The controversy had centered on certain aspects of the design, including the size and scope of the structure’s large-scale metal tapestries. But family members lifted their objection last year, giving the project final impetus.
The tapestries remain — they had already been reduced from three sides to one — but will include a more international scene, a representation of the D-Day landing sites in Normandy, France, as they appear today, instead of the hills of Kansas. The idea was to put more emphasis on the international aspects of Eisenhower’s life. The memorial, however, also includes a focus elsewhere on Kansas, Eisenhower’s home state, particularly Abilene, where he grew up.
The National Capital Planning Commission and the United States Commission of Fine Arts both approved the last modifications to the design earlier this fall. The majority of the memorial’s cost is to come from federal funding, though the commission is also raising private funds.
