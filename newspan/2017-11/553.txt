The studio behind the hit television series “House of Cards” has suspended Kevin Spacey while it investigates what it called “serious allegations” concerning the actor’s behavior on set.
The announcement by the studio, Media Rights Capital, came late Friday night and did not detail the nature of the allegations. It came shortly after Netflix said in a separate statement that it would not be involved with any further production of “House of Cards” if the show included its star, Mr. Spacey.
Production of the show’s sixth season had already been suspended earlier this week.
The announcements came after Variety reported earlier Friday that “House of Cards” producers were considering killing off Frank Underwood, the diabolical politician played by Mr. Spacey.
In its statement on Friday night, Netflix also announced that it would “not be moving forward with the release of the film ‘Gore’” — a Gore Vidal biopic in postproduction that starred Mr. Spacey.
Several “House of Cards” executives did not respond Friday night to email and phone messages seeking comment.
An attempt to reach Mr. Spacey by email was not immediately successful.
Reaction to claims against Mr. Spacey that have surfaced this week has been swift. On Sunday, BuzzFeed published an article in which the actor Anthony Rapp accused Mr. Spacey — a two-time Oscar winner — of having made an unwanted sexual advance toward him in the 1980s, when Mr. Rapp was 14 and Mr. Spacey was in his mid-20s.
The next day, Netflix announced that the sixth season of “House of Cards” would be its last. The day after that, Netflix and Media Rights Capital said production was being halted.
Then Thursday, The Los Angeles Times reported that Creative Artists Agency and Polaris PR had parted ways with Mr. Spacey. Attempts to reach the agency and public relations firm were not successful late Friday.
