“In Academia, a Predatory Twist in Publishing” (ScienceTimes, Oct. 31) aligns two worrisome trends: the ever-increasing need to publish or perish and the commercialization of science.
Each trend on its own has been around for a while, but predatory journals effectively ply the two together for goals that have nothing to do with traditional scientific values.
Reputable, peer-reviewed science supports healthy, productive, developing societies. When done best, it provides solutions for a multitude of problems facing the world.
As an academic and publisher, I understand the need to publish. But given the political climate — claims of fake news, science denialism and blatant obfuscation of fact — we need to be especially diligent about ensuring that academic publishing adheres to the highest standards.
This is even more serious and urgent given the potential cuts to existing science standards, funding and the general value of science in issues facing our everyday lives.
