The Public Theater is holding a town hall-style gathering next month to discuss sexual harassment, misconduct and abuse in New York’s theater community.
The decision to hold the town hall follows allegations of harassment or inappropriate behavior against a series of prominent men, including the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and the actor Kevin Spacey.
She said the theater was inspired by similar events in London, at the Royal Court theater, which resulted in a code of behavior, and in Chicago’s theater community.
Ms. Ybarra said she hoped the discussion would involve “listening to other people and sharing thoughts,” and noted that she had witnessed sexual harassment in her near 20 years in the theater world.
“Given the moment we are in nationally I think the public are very aware of the pervasive nature of the culture of sexual harassment, including in arts and culture. So it feels very appropriate to be talking to our own community about how we can shift this culture ourselves,” she said.
The event, to be held on Dec. 4 at 2 p.m., is free and open to those working in the theater industry in New York.
