After more than 500 performances, “Spamilton” will pack up its knee-high boots and end its Off Broadway run on Jan. 7. The show, a spoof of “Hamilton” created by Gerard Alessandrini, performed extremely well at the box office; producers are planning a national tour.
We just came from Spamilton. This is Dan Rosales, the talented young man who plays me.
The show was extended several times, and even moved from uptown to the 47th Street Theater, just a block from where “Hamilton” plays at the Richard Rodgers Theater. Productions have been staged in Chicago and Los Angeles.
