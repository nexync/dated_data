Good morning on this nippy Wednesday.
Among Mayor de Blasio’s promises in the next four years: the creation of thousands of affordable housing units, a friendlier police force, and free, full-day preschool for 3-year-olds.
A brisk-but-beautiful Wednesday.
It may feel as chilly as 30 or 40 degrees when you head out this morning — especially with the breeze — but the high should climb to 50 and the sunshine should take the edge off.
Same shtick on Thursday, but you’ll want to dust off your winter coat by Friday.
• New York Comedy Festival continues with shows at Caroline’s, Gotham Comedy Club and Comedy Cellar in Manhattan, and the Bell House, Union Hall and Gutter Bar in Brooklyn. Times and prices vary.
• Looking ahead: On Thursday, New York Times journalists who covered the sexual harassment cases of Harvey Weinstein, Bill O’Reilly and others join TimesTalks to discuss exposing male abuse of power.
• Knicks at Magic, 7 p.m. (MSG). Rangers host Bruins, 8 p.m. (NBCS).
• Alternate-side parking remains in effect until Friday.
Can you imagine local art and architecture made of cans?
Stop by this year and you may see a tree made of cans. Or perhaps a can-made pineapple, Pokémon or Pacman character — to name just a few.
You can check out the display any day of the week, through Nov. 15, from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., except on the closing day, which wraps up at 6 p.m.
