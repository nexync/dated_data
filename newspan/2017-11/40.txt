What Would You Choose to Do If You Had Unlimited Free Time and No Restrictions?
What would you do with your time if you did not have to go to school? How would you fill your days, especially if adults placed no restrictions on your choice?
“Hero Dog” is the first of six books in a series featuring Ms. Lysiak; they draw significantly from her experiences chasing the news in real-life Selinsgrove, where her parents give her a two-mile-wide stomping ground. The books, which Ms. Lysiak works on with her father, Matthew Lysiak, include definitions for terms like a “deadline” or a “press pass” and reporting tips like the six questions, which she used to write on her arm in marker so she wouldn’t forget them. The second book in the series was released on Tuesday. Ms. Lysiak’s story has also been optioned by Paramount TV and Anonymous Content for a television series.
