Re “Why Slashing Nuclear Power May Backfire” (Economic Scene column, Nov. 8): Eduardo Porter argues that global investment in renewable energy isn’t making much of a dent in global carbon emissions. At the same time, the column asserts that the $250 billion we are now spending globally on wind and solar would have to be doubled to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.
Mr. Porter concludes, “Building a zero-carbon energy system requires broader thinking about the technological mix.” Does that broader thinking entail giving life support to a technology that has proved itself prohibitively costly and environmentally perilous?
