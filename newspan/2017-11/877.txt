“Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” this isn’t. Dwayne Johnson will follow his forthcoming comedy sequel with a less family-friendly wildlife adventure, “Rampage.” In it, he plays a primatologist who forges a strong bond with a silverback gorilla named George (not to be confused with Curious George).
After a botched genetic experiment causes George to mutate into a King Kong-like giant, the scientist tries to save his simian pal while battling other oversized creatures, including a 30-foot-long wolf and a gigantic crocodile.
The new trailer suggests the movie combines elements of “Planet of the Apes” with “Snakes on a Plane” (albeit with an ape). “Rampage” will reach theaters April 20.
