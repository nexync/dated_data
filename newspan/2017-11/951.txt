IF WISHES WERE BOOKS: It’s holiday time. So in keeping with a loose tradition at Inside the List, I asked a handful of best-selling authors to talk up their favorite reads of 2017, old or new. Granted, not everybody will find a limited 1909 edition of “Gulliver’s Travels.” But we can wish.
Jacqueline Woodson, author of “Brown Girl Dreaming”: As someone who doesn’t read a lot of nonfiction, I was pleasantly surprised by David Friend’s “The Naughty Nineties” — basically a sexual history of that decade (and a guidebook for this one!). Friend brings us right back to all the amazing drama of that time: from Clinton and Lewinsky to Lorena Bobbitt to O. J. Simpson. It’s funny, scandalous, whip-smart and infinitely readable.
Celeste Ng, author of “Little Fires Everywhere”: In a year that made me furious, Daisy Johnson’s “Fen” was a howl I didn’t know I needed. This linked collection takes place in the marshes, where things that some might wish to keep hidden refuse to stay buried, and resurface in unexpected ways. It’s hauntingly written and full of unabashedly, refreshingly angry women who are hungry — both figuratively and literally — for things long denied them.
Neil de Grasse Tyson, author of “Astrophysics for People in a Hurry”: This year I obtained a copy of Jonathan Swift’s 1726 classic “Gulliver’s Travels,” illustrated and signed by Arthur Rackham, in a limited 1909 edition. Most of us know this satire from childhood, via cartoons. But those tend to focus only on Lemuel Gulliver’s voyage to Lilliput, the land of little people, where the animations hardly ever portray how Gulliver actually put out the fire in town — by urinating on the flaming buildings. A possible comment on what big people do to little people, even on the premise of helping them.
