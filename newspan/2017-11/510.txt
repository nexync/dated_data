When Scott Michaels began the “Helter Skelter” tour about eight years ago, he offered it roughly once a month. Now, he guides people around the sites of the Manson family murders at least once a weekend, often selling out weeks in advance.
The three-and-a-half-hour tour is often filled with middle-age adults who were children during the murder spree that Charles Manson, who died Sunday, orchestrated in the summer of 1969.
The fact that the murders happened “in the sanctuary of the home” contributed to much of the fear that captivated people at the time, said Steve Oney, who wrote an oral history of the killings for Los Angeles Magazine in 2009.
Mr. Michaels said that while his tour is focused on the historic sites, in some ways the fascination with Mr. Manson is “a little less about the murders and more about the myth.” Now that the man has died, will the mystique die with him too?
The stretch of the Owens Valley had been cleared of Native Americans decades before. In the 1940s, the federal government found a new use for Manzanar as the site of one of the largest Japanese internment camps.
It was on this day in 1945 that the camp was closed for good.
While many of those who had spent years in the camp left eagerly, some refused to leave because they had lost everything when they were forcibly removed from their home years before. Some were removed by force once again.
As they left, the people who had been incarcerated were given $25 and a one-way train or bus ticket back to the towns where they had lived before the war.
Today, there is an annual pilgrimage to the site which draws hundreds of people to the area.
