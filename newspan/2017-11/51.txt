A magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck southeastern Iran near the city of Kerman on Friday morning, the United States Geological Survey said.
The quake, initially reported as magnitude 6.3, was centered 36 miles northeast of Kerman, a city of more than 821,000. It was very shallow, at a depth of 6.2 miles, which would have amplified the shaking.
A magnitude-6.0 quake is considered strong and capable of causing severe damage.
