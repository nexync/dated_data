Senator Marco Rubio is absolutely right: Having children is expensive and we must do more to help families, especially those living in poverty, provide their children with a strong start in life.
Mr. Rubio advocates an expansion of the child tax credit, which helps cover the cost of having kids. And while it serves a vital purpose, the credit does not directly address the rapidly rising cost of child care and early education programs.
This is a big deal because in 33 states, including the senatorâ€™s home state of Florida, the cost of child care is higher than in-state college tuition. That means accessing high-quality early education programs is not an option for many children living in poverty, who are the very kids who stand to benefit most from such opportunities.
When kids attend good child care programs, they are more likely to start school ready to learn, graduate from high school and stay in the work force.
Congress should do more than just expand the child tax credit. Lawmakers should also expand and enhance the child and dependent care tax credit, which was created specifically to help more families afford quality child care.
