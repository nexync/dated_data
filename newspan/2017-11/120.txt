After decades of decline, largely as a result of the collapse of the auto industry, a bankruptcy settlement has allowed Detroit to begin rebuilding. Here are three books that trace the city’s past and present.
In a book spanning more than three centuries, Boyd (whom our reviewer called Detroit’s “griot”) tells the city’s history from French trading outpost to auto manufacturing hub to a symbol for urban decline, but he places black people at the center of it all. Boyd guides us through a number of social movements that flourished in Detroit — abolitionism, union organizing and civil rights, for instance. He introduces a wide range of characters, including enslaved Africans, the founders of the city’s first black newspaper, the first black congressman, and many more. His book culminates in his account of the black power era in the 1960s, of which Detroit was a prominent home. Despite Detroit’s current state of crisis, black Detroiters “have been steadfast in their resolve and optimistic about the future,” wrote Boyd.
