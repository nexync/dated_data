A couple of artisanal spirits now produced at the new All Points West Distillery in the Ironbound section of Newark are worth adding to the bar. Bone Black Vodka — wheat-based and so named because it has been filtered through charcoal made from bones — is strong at 104 proof, but smooth, with a touch of sweetness in its finish. Cathouse Gin, 92 proof, mellows the traditional maceration of juniper and coriander with elderberry and rose hips. Both spirits are sold at the distillery, open on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m. and Saturdays from 2 to 8 p.m.: Bone Black Vodka, $28, Cathouse Gin, $32, at All Points West Distillery, 424 Mulberry Street (Tichenor Street), Newark, |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , allpointswestdistillery.com; Cork Wine and Spirits, locations in Hoboken and Harrison, N.J., |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , corkwines.net.
