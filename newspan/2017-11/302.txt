Christina Marie Gagnier and Abraham Benjamin Dyk were married Nov. 11 at the Please Touch Museum in Philadelphia. They were wed under Pennsylvania’s self-uniting marriage statute; the groom’s father, Judge Timothy B. Dyk of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, led the ceremony.
Ms. Gagnier, 35, is the managing partner in Gagnier Margossian, a law firm in San Francisco, where she oversees the firm’s internet, intellectual property and technology practice. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of California, Irvine, where she is an adjunct professor of privacy law, and received a Master of Public Administration from the University of Southern California. She also received a law degree from the University of San Francisco.
She is the daughter of Kathleen M. Miller of Freedom, Pa., and the late Chris Gagnier. The bride’s mother retired as an administrator in Azusa, Calif., for the Azusa Unified District. Her father was an independent real estate broker in Chino, Calif.
Mr. Dyk, also 35, is a partner in MVAR Media, a Democratic media consulting firm in Alexandria, Va. He graduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania and is studying for a law degree at N.Y.U. School of Law, where his mother, Sally Katzen, is a professor of practice. Upon graduation in August 2018, he is to begin clerking on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit for Judge Kent A. Jordan, whose chambers are in Wilmington, Del.
His parents live in Washington. The groom’s mother is also the former deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, and the deputy director of the National Economic Council for President Bill Clinton.
The couple met in Philadelphia in 2016 while the groom was working at the Democratic National Convention. He saw his future wife walking through the lobby of the Ritz Carlton hotel there and started a conversation.
