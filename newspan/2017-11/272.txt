My husband and I have been married for 30 years. We celebrated our anniversary quietly, with a feeling of contentment for our love for each other and our commitment to a future together.
I usually skip your articles about love and romance. But I decided to glance at this one: 10 couples in New York with photos and answers to questions.
I assumed that there would be couples like us. On the contrary, nine of the 10 couples were in their 20s, 30s and 40s — the young and the beautiful, laughing, filled with passion. One couple, older, formerly married to other people, were together just five years.
What does love look like? Love is accepting that your partner is not perfect, but you want to be with him or her anyway. Love is being grateful that you are accepted despite your imperfections.
Love is weathering the children, the death of one’s parents, the dishes and the flat tires. Love is still being happy to come home to that same person, even after 30 years. That’s what love looks like to me.
