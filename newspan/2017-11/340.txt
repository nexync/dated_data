Seeing Bob Dylan in 2017 is a wondrously strange experience. He seems uninterested in giving his live audiences a close approximation of their favorite records; instead, he twists his songs into wild new forms, laying on the brimstone and blues. It’s anything but a canned nostalgia trip, which is refreshing in an age with plenty of nostalgia to go around. Opening at this five-night stand (at 7:30 p.m. Monday through Nov. 25) is his longtime friend Mavis Staples, whose latest album, “If All I Was Was Black,” arrives Nov. 17.
