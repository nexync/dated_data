In 1972, I was a student at Fordham College at Lincoln Center. I commuted to campus from Hoboken via the Port Authority Bus Terminal and, on the way home in the late afternoon, the bus on Ninth Avenue.
One day, a blind woman asked me to tell her when the bus was coming. It took some time for the bus to arrive, and we conversed a bit. She told me that she worked at a nearby church. We exchanged names. We probably spent 10 minutes together in all.
Several months later, the same woman approached me and asked that I tell her when the bus was coming. I had not seen her since our earlier meeting. I said I would happily tell her when the bus was approaching.
