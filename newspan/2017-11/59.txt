The campaign to save James Baldwin’s former home in the French village of Saint-Paul-de-Vence seems to have failed.
On Nov. 16, the French newspaper Nice-Matin reported that the site will be developed into a luxury apartment complex. The development, called Le Jardin des Arts, is slated to open by June 2019.
Sotheby’s, which is acting as the complex’s real estate agent, is now accepting reservations for apartments. According to Nice-Matin, four units have already been reserved.
Preservationists, led by the novelist Shannon Cain’s organization His Place in Provence, have been trying to raise money to buy the property where Baldwin lived and turn it into a writer’s retreat.
In April, The New York Times reported that Socri, the property’s developer, would be open to selling the property for 9 million euros (then about $9.5 million) but that it planned to begin construction on the site soon. A representative of the company also said it would be disinclined to sell the property to Ms. Cain, who squatted in the house during the summer of 2016 to protest the developer’s actions.
His Place in Provence held an art auction on Nov. 18 to generate funds for its cause.
Baldwin first moved to France in 1948. He shuttled back and forth between France, the United States, Switzerland and Turkey until 1970, when he settled in Saint-Paul-de-Vence. The medieval village, nestled between the Alps and the Côte d’Azur, was his home until his death in 1987.
During this period, he completed several written works, including the novel “If Beale Street Could Talk,” and hosted leading artistic figures like Ella Fitzgerald and Miles Davis.
