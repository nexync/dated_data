Why Is Alec Baldwin at Least $1 Million Richer Today?
The long-running art world dispute between Alec Baldwin and the art dealer Mary Boone has been settled, with Ms. Boone paying at least $1 million to the actor and celebrity.
Mr. Baldwin sued Ms. Boone in New York State Supreme Court last year, asserting that he had been defrauded when he purchased a painting from Ms. Boone in 2010.
Mr. Baldwin had paid $190,000 for the painting, but had suspicions when it arrived because it appeared brighter and smelled of fresh paint when he received it. The case was due to go to trial next year and Mr. Baldwin had contended that Mr. Bleckner had painted it at Ms. Boone’s request when she was unable to secure the original that Mr. Baldwin sought.
A lawyer for Mr. Baldwin, Steven N. Feldman, would not detail the settlement but acknowledged a few of the terms. Mr. Baldwin had been paid a seven-figure sum, he said, plus he will receive two other Bleckner paintings, an existing work and a new painting created by Mr. Bleckner for Mr. Baldwin. Mr. Baldwin also gets to keep the “Sea and Mirror” he bought from Ms. Boone.
Ted Poretz, a lawyer for Ms. Boone, declined to comment.
The settlement was first reported by the New Yorker magazine.
According to the magazine, Mr. Baldwin plans to donate half of the settlement to a fund helping to rebuild the Sag Harbor Cinema, which was destroyed by fire last year.
