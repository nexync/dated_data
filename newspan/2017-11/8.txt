First, one key element in any relationship is how well you see the other person. In the first room people see each other deeply. In the second regime they see each other in a degraded way. In the third regime the harasser doesn’t see his victim at all. The men who have recently been exposed say they had no idea how much pain they were causing.
It is necessary but not enough to have a negative vision of what men should not do. It would also be nice if there were some positive vision of how sexuality fits into a rich life, how it flourishes in the private sphere as a (very fun) form of deep knowing. If we had a clearer concept of a beautiful relationship we’d also have a clearer concept of what predatory behavior looks like and what it takes to eradicate it. In a degraded environment, the predators, who are few and vicious, are more likely to be tolerated by the many, who are numb.
