While the first ballot measure that New Yorkers will be asked to consider on Tuesday would offer the inadvisable possibility of reworking the entire State Constitution in a convention, two other proposals would amend the Constitution in a more typical way. They were approved by the Legislature twice and now voters will make the final decision.
Proposal 2 would direct Albany to give judges authority to reduce or revoke the pension of a politician who commits a crime in office. Now, public officials can be convicted of felonies, go to prison and collect retirement checks for their supposed public service. The crime would have to be related to the politicianâ€™s public duties and occur after this year. The courts could also be allowed to make certain that the loss of funds would not unduly harm dependents.
Proposal 3 would give communities in the Adirondacks and Catskills more flexibility to make vital repairs to roads or bridges and to add services like bike lanes or utility lines. It would allow the state to create a land bank of 250 acres of newly preserved forest to replace the land used by these communities. The entire state would benefit from land preserved in a way that still accommodates the needs of communities within these parks.
Along with rejecting Proposal 1, voters should approve Proposals 2 and 3.
