Natalia Roman and Francois Franceschini left Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria and are living with his aunt in the Bronx. The couple, who recently enjoyed a boat ride in Central Park, said they are making plans to stay on the mainland.
CENTRAL ISLIP, N.Y. — She had traded in her new normal in Puerto Rico — no electricity, no internet, no classes — for the suburbs of Long Island and the comforts of a Residence Inn. Aurelys Alers-Ortiz traveled with several other University of Puerto Rico law students who took up Touro Law Center’s offer to flee the devastation of Hurricane Maria and finish their semester here.
The motivation to leave is driven in large part by the dire circumstances on the island. Basic essentials are hard to find and electricity and other utilities are unreliable or entirely inaccessible. Much of the population has been unable to return to jobs or to school and access to health care has been severely limited.
