Wall Street has just received a reminder that initial public offerings are not child’s play. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America presided over a 41 percent drop in shares of Funko, the maker of pop-culture dolls, for the worst first-day showing in 17 years. On the same day, Allena Pharmaceuticals, a company developing drugs for metabolic diseases, fell 29 percent. Faddish, highly leveraged and speculative firms can find a buyer — if bankers price them right first.
Trying to gauge investor demand for such companies can be difficult. The definition of what is considered risky tends to shrink as animal spirits rise, and vice versa. For example, there were no biotech I.P.O.s for a year and a half during the financial meltdown nearly a decade ago. Investors had no interest in companies without profit or revenue. That’s not the case this year, with over 30 biotech offerings so far.
Bankers are well paid to find the right price. Companies don’t want to mess up their public debut, so they tend to prefer the top Wall Street firms and can pay hefty fees.
Funko is not the sort of firm that investors would clamor to buy when markets were weak. Its private-equity owner had extracted more than $100 million in cash from the firm since it went private in 2015, leaving its debt at over $200 million. Funko also lost money in the first six months of the year. A robust holiday season could produce a profit, but it is also questionable whether selling giant-headed dolls of pop-culture figures is a sustainable business.
The fact that bankers cut the amount of shares offered and reduced the price from the indicated range, yet the stock still suffered a vertiginous drop, could simply indicate they got demand wrong. Then again, the poor performance that both Funko and Allena suffered could signal something bigger: investors’ receding appetite for risk.
