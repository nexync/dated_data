• The U.S. authorities are holding a former Hong Kong government official and a former foreign minister of Senegal on charges of bribing high-level officials in Chad and Uganda. Prosecutors said the money was meant to secure contracts for a mysterious, private Chinese conglomerate, CEFC China Energy, which has global ambitions and enormous wealth.
The U.S. claims jurisdiction because some of the deals linked to the two officials — Patrick Ho, 68, and Cheikh Gadio, 61 — were made in the United States. CEFC China Energy issued a blanket denial.
Separately, the former head of China’s powerful cyberspace agency was detained in an internal Communist Party corruption inquiry.

• A range of analysts told The Times that President Trump’s re-designation of North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, and the addition of more sanctions, might dash any remaining hopes that diplomacy might end threats from Pyongyang.
Such prospects do not bode well for South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, who has sought to ease tensions as the country prepares to host the Winter Olympics in February.
North Korea has yet to respond to Mr. Trump’s move.
• President Bashar al-Assad made a rare trip out of war-ravaged Syria, visiting Russia and thanking President Vladimir Putin for military intervention he credited with “saving” the country.
Both take part in a summit meeting today with Iran, Turkey and Russia aimed at ending Syria’s six-year civil war. The Islamic State has lost much of its territory there, but its fighters remain a threat, and armed opposition groups still hold wide sections of the country.

• Most of what Americans know about Thanksgiving is less than accurate. Here are the myths and the truth.
Last week, President Trump reversed the government’s decision to start allowing hunters to import trophies of elephants that were killed in two African countries.
More than a century ago, another president took the opposite approach.
Shortly after leaving office in 1909, Theodore Roosevelt led a safari to Africa, organized by the Smithsonian Institution and partly financed by Andrew Carnegie, the industrialist and philanthropist. The group gathered specimens for what is now the National Museum of Natural History in Washington.
Then, as now, hunting was not without controversy.
The expedition lasted nearly a year — stretching from what is now Kenya to Sudan — and included Roosevelt’s son Kermit and several naturalists from the Smithsonian.
The group ultimately collected more than 11,000 specimens, many of them bugs, plants and small mammals. But about 500 were big game animals shot by Roosevelt or his son.
