SEOUL, South Korea — Two days after President Trump re-designated North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, the country responded on Wednesday by calling the decision “a serious provocation” and vowed to keep up its nuclear and missile programs as a deterrent against the “hostile” United States.
The comments were North Korea’s first official reaction to Mr. Trump’s decision on Monday to restore the country to Washington’s list of terrorism-sponsoring states, along with Iran, Sudan and Syria. On Tuesday, the Treasury Department announced a new round of sanctions to impede the North’s nuclear and ballistic missile program, targeting North Korean companies and ships as well as Chinese trading companies.
The re-listing raised fears in the region that North Korea might take it as an excuse to resume weapons tests. It last launched a missile on Sept. 15.
On Wednesday, the unidentified North Korean spokesman did not mention any direct threat to launch missiles. But he said that the North’s “deterrence will be further strengthened” — and that the country “must continue to keep the treasured nuclear sword in our hands more tightly” — as long as Washington continued with its “hostile policy” against the North.
