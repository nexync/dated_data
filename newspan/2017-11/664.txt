Taylor Swift’s ‘Reputation’ Has Arrived. Let’s Discuss.
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
When Taylor Swift released “Reputation” on Friday, she returned not as the pop outsider she once was — or once played — but as one of the most well-known and influential pop artists in the world.
In the past, she’s always stood apart from her superstar peers with her proprietary (and shifting) blend of country and pop. But on her sixth album, she decides to play a different game: making pop music that directly competes with the rest of the dominant players of the day, a potentially fraught choice. Initial sales numbers, however, were impressive: 925,000 copies sold in just three days, of which just 600,000 were digital downloads (the full album is not available on streaming services — yet).
Following last week’s pregame analysis, on this week’s Popcast The New York Times pop music crew — Mr. Caramanica, the pop music editor Caryn Ganz, the chief pop music critic Jon Pareles, and the pop music reporter Joe Coscarelli — reconvenes after listening to “Reputation” for a postgame dissection of the album, including a segment for listener questions.
