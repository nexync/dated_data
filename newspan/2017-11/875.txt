The country music industry just learned the same lesson the National Football League and others have: No matter how much some people may wish for it, there’s no escape from politics.
The organizers of the 52nd Annual Country Music Association Awards, one of the industry’s biggest events, hoped to keep the focus on the music during its show on Nov. 8, and not on the 58 people who were killed and the 527 who were injured when Stephen Paddock opened fire at a country music festival in Las Vegas barely more than a month ago.
Mr. Paisley’s words turned out to be prescient. The organization backtracked and apologized on Friday afternoon, saying in a statement that it would lift the restrictions.
“The sentiment was not to infringe and was created with the best of intentions to honor and celebrate Country music,” the organization said.
Had it looked to the sports world, the C.M.A. might have known keeping politics out of reach doesn’t often work well. The N.F.L. has found itself at the center of a political maelstrom as its players protest police brutality during the national anthem, while the White House called for ESPN to fire Jemele Hill, one of its commentators, for her political tweets.
Some country music stars have been open about their politics this year. Caleb Keeter, a guitarist for the Josh Abbott Band, posted a lengthy note on Twitter after the Las Vegas shooting about changing his mind on gun control.
