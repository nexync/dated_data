David Letterman’s prize ceremony has A-list guests. And “Baltimore Rising” paints a portrait of the city after the death of Freddie Gray.
BALTIMORE RISING (2017) 8 p.m. on HBO; also on HBO streaming platforms. This documentary follows community members in Baltimore after the arrest of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old African-American man whose death, while in police custody, was felt nationwide in 2015. Directed by the actress Sonja Sohn (“The Wire”), the film follows police officers, activists and city residents as they reckon with the aftermath of Gray’s death.
THERE WILL BE BLOOD (2007) on iTunes and Amazon. While you wait for “Phantom Thread,” Paul Thomas Anderson’s coming collaboration with the actor Daniel Day-Lewis, you can revisit this pair’s previous project, about an oil baron during the California oil boom at the turn of the 20th century. The role won Mr. Day-Lewis his second of three Academy Awards for best actor, and if he wins again for “Phantom Thread,” he will tie Katharine Hepburn’s Oscar record.
McCABE & MRS. MILLER (1971) On iTunes and Amazon. It has been just over a year since Leonard Cohen, the Canadian folk singer beloved for his warm and whispered poetry, died. His songs provide the soundtrack for this Robert Altman western, in which a roving gambler (Warren Beatty) joins forces with a British prostitute (Julie Christie) to open a brothel in a mountain town in Washington State. The critic Roger Ebert once wrote that Altman had “made a dozen films that can be called great in one way or another, but one of them is perfect, and that one is ‘McCabe & Mrs. Miller.’” The palpable chill of these hills — captured in wide shots — makes the film an especially fitting choice as the months grow colder.
