The Broadway revival of “M. Butterfly” will close Jan. 14, six weeks earlier than scheduled.
The revival, directed by Julie Taymor and starring Clive Owen, opened to mixed reviews and has begun showing weakness at the box office.
The original production, about a married French diplomat who falls in love with a Chinese opera singer, won the Tony Award for best new play in 1988. The playwright, David Henry Hwang, revised the script for this version, incorporating new information about the historical relationship that inspired the fictional work.
Mr. Hwang, who was the first Asian-American writer to have a play on Broadway, framed it in part as a critique of the Puccini opera “Madama Butterfly.” The play is also significant because of questions it raises about East-West relations and about gender and sexuality.
The revival began previews Oct. 7 and opened Oct. 26. At the time of its closing it will have played 19 preview and 93 regular performances at the Cort Theater. It has not recouped its capitalization costs; although it got a healthy start at the box office, it had a substantial drop last week, when Mr. Owen missed two performances, and it played to houses that were only 47 percent full.
