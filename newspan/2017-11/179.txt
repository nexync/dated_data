Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama invited America’s Nobel Prize winners to the White House most years, to celebrate their achievements and thank them for their discoveries. This year, the American winners of Nobels in physics, chemistry, economics and physiology were lauded at the Swedish Embassy in Washington.
They received no invitation to meet President Trump.
The White House didn’t give a firm reason for this, using the president’s travel schedule as an excuse. But like scientists, we can hypothesize. Perhaps Mr. Trump, who has canceled the White House Science Fair, appointed a radio talk show host as the Department of Agriculture’s chief scientist and nobody at all as White House science adviser, isn’t big on research’s value to society.
Try explaining why a tiny, far-off chirp should matter to Mr. Trump, who has been known to blast off half a dozen tweets before most people even arrive at their LIGOs in the morning.
What could he possibly teach this president about that?
