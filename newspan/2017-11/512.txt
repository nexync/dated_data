Li Yonghong, above, the Chinese businessman who bought Italy’s world-famous soccer club for $860 million in April, doesn’t seem to control the mining empire he claimed.

Pope Francis has declared Sunday as the World Day of the Poor.
The pope has urged the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics to honor the day. The Vatican will be observing it with a Mass celebrated by 4,000 poor and needy people, who will then be invited to lunch. This week, free medical services have been provided in front of St. Peter’s Square, and charitable volunteers will be honored in prayer.
In a message released in June, Francis exhorted Catholics to go beyond the “occasional volunteer work, or of impromptu acts of generosity that appease our conscience” and to truly encounter the impoverished.
The Mass will be streamed live on Sunday at 4 a.m. Eastern and again at 1:30 p.m. Eastern. You can watch it here.
