LONDON — Boris Johnson, Britain’s foreign secretary, apologized on Monday for misleading remarks about a British-Iranian woman imprisoned in Iran that her family said could be used to justify, and even prolong, her sentence for sedition.
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in Tehran last year and sentenced to five years in prison for what her family and other supporters said were fabricated allegations of plotting to overthrow the Iranian establishment.
Addressing Parliament this month, Mr. Johnson condemned the imprisonment of Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, saying that she had been “simply teaching people journalism” before her arrest in April 2016.
But that statement was untrue, according to her family and the foundation. They said she went to Iran on a vacation to visit family.
Mr. Johnson at first equivocated, saying his remarks could have been clearer and that there was no doubt that Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been on vacation. But he failed to apologize, prompting a wave of criticism, including calls for opposition lawmakers to call for his resignation.
On Monday, Mr. Johnson addressed Parliament again, this time apologizing for the anguish he had caused the family.
Mr. Johnson said that he hoped to meet Mrs. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard, before traveling to Iran in a few weeks. Mr. Ratcliffe told the BBC this month that he hoped to accompany the foreign secretary to Iran so he could see his wife for the first time in 19 months, but that he was unsure if his request would be accepted.
