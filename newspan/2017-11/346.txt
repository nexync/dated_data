Witnesses described the rampage as gruesome, grisly and surreal.
The suspect was identified as Sayfullo Saipov, a 29-year-old native of Uzbekistan, which is considered a militant breeding ground. He was living legally in the U.S., but some close to him saw signs of trouble.
President Trump said that he would consider sending Mr. Saipov to the U.S. prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and called on Congress to cancel the immigration program that granted him entry.

Sixty years ago this week, the first animal was launched into orbit: Laika, a stray dog found on the streets of Moscow.
On Nov. 3, 1957, Soviet scientists covered Laika in a special spacesuit, placed her in the Sputnik 2 satellite and launched her toward the heavens.
“She barked greetings to her audience into the microphone,” according to a Times report at the time citing Soviet media.
Laika, of course, did not return. Questions about her fate were only resolved in 2002, when it was revealed that she died only hours after launch.
In 1960, another Soviet mission sent canine cosmonauts to space. This time, they returned to Earth safely after orbiting the planet.
The dogs, Belka and Strelka, traveled in separate compartments, connected by a window. Rats, mice and flies were also on their flight.
In 1961, Jacqueline Kennedy, the U.S. first lady, asked the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev about the two dogs, and he ordered one of Strelka’s puppies to be sent to White House as a gift.
