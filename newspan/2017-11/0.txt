It was early evening on a beautiful summer day. I was sitting on one of those giant boulders in Central Park waiting for a concert at the MoMA Sculpture Garden to start. I had brought along a split of Champagne.
As I struggled to open it, the cork gave way, spraying some of the contents onto the rock.
Moments later, a butterfly landed near some of the spilled drink that had pooled in a small crevice. I couldn’t quite believe what I was seeing: The butterfly appeared to be drinking the Champagne with its long proboscis.
I was giddy. What a wonderful way to start my first summer in New York.
The butterfly stayed there for a while, and then flew off. I watched to see whether it was tipsy; I thought that it must be.
All these years later, I’ve had many adventures and my artistic resolve remains strong, yet I realize that the dreams of youth very often do not come out exactly as you thought they would.
Still, I remember that charming date in Central Park when I shared Champagne with a butterfly and everything seemed possible.
