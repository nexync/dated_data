Jon Stewart hosts a star-studded fund-raiser. And a documentary on SundanceTV revisits murders made famous by Truman Capote.
I AM ELIZABETH SMART (2017) 8 p.m. on Lifetime. Elizabeth Smart was 14 in 2002, the year she was kidnapped at knife point from her family’s Salt Lake City home. It would be nine months before she would return. According to a 2010 article in The Times, the ordeal “galvanized parental nightmares nationwide, but subsequently underscored the power of human resilience with the recovery and return to life that Ms. Smart appears to have made.” In this new film, Ms. Smart narrates a cinematic retelling of her story.
COLD BLOODED: THE CLUTTER FAMILY MURDERS 9 p.m. on SundanceTV. Between Truman Capote’s genre-defining 1966 nonfiction novel, “In Cold Blood”; the 1967 film of the same name; and “Capote,” the 2005 film about the writing of the book, you’ve probably already heard this story of murder on a Kansas farm. But this two-part documentary presents new reporting and interviews that offer a deeper look at the case itself, and examines how the impact of Capote’s book has inextricably linked it to the killings and spurred a lasting national obsession with true crime. To see that obsession in action, you can also watch David Fincher’s “Zodiac” (2007), which airs on Sundance immediately before “Cold Blooded,” at 5:30 p.m.
BEAN (2017) 10 p.m. on Fuse; also on Fuse streaming platforms. “I did not expect to find a kidney on Tinder” is a sentence you’ll hear in this new documentary, which chronicles the story of a lesbian couple who, weeks after meeting on the dating app Tinder, learn that one is a kidney donor match for the other.
