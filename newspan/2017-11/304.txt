ST. CHARLES, Mo. — President Trump flew to Missouri on Wednesday to talk about tax cuts lifting Main Street and the middle class. But he kept getting sidetracked by repeating unfounded claims that the tax bill poised to pass the Senate would hurt rich people, himself included.
Mr. Trump went on to promise to sign the bill, and to vow that, if passed, it would reduce taxes by $2,000 a year for a family of four with a $75,000 annual income. A few moments later, Mr. Trump was back talking about the rich, and about his own taxes going up.
Attacking the rich is exactly the sort of language that helped Mr. Trump win the presidency, and that has formed the foundation of the sales pitch both Senate and House Republicans have made for their versions of the tax bill. It is not supported by independent analyses.
The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has found that the bulk of the benefits from the House and Senate tax bills, in sheer dollars, would flow to the highest-earning Americans. That is particularly true of the Senate bill which the committee projects, as written, would actually raise taxes on Americans earning $75,000 or less by 2027. In contrast, high earners would continue to benefit.
Mr. Trump would almost certainly benefit from the Senate bill’s slight reduction in the top marginal income tax rate — and benefit greatly from both bills’ provisions that would lower taxes dramatically for owners of so-called pass-through companies, which is the structure of the bulk of Mr. Trump’s business empire.
Near the end of his speech, Mr. Trump spoke more favorably about the wealthy in order to complain about the opposition by Democrats to an attempt to eliminate the estate tax, which currently applies only to a handful of wealthy estates.
