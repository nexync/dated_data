Meryl Deborah Hartzband and Peter Freed are to be married Nov. 5. Rabbi Dr. David L. Levinsky is to perform the ceremony at the Stein Eriksen Lodge Deer Valley, a hotel in Park City, Utah.
Ms. Hartzband, 63, retired as the chief investment officer at Stone Point Capital, a private investment firm in Greenwich, Conn. She graduated from Cornell and received an M.B.A. from Columbia. She is also a director of both the New York chapter of Planned Parenthood and of the Roundabout Theater Company.
She is a daughter of Francine R. Hartzband and Harry M. Hartzband of Denver. The bride’s father retired as the head of marketing and logistics at the Exxon Corporation, which then had its headquarters in New York.
Mr. Freed, 64, is a photographer and commercial advertising director in New York. His work has been featured in The New York Times, Architectural Digest, Town and Country, Newsweek and other publications. He graduated from American University.
He is the son of the late Bernice Freed and the late Shepard J. Freed, who lived in Providence, R.I. The groom’s father was the owner of Main Wholesale, a toy distributor that was in Providence, and retired as the vice president of marketing at the Milton D. Myer Company, a toy manufacturer that was in Pittsburgh.
The groom’s previous marriage ended in divorce, as did the bride’s two previous marriages.
The couple met in January through a mutual acquaintance who is a professional matchmaker, though neither was her client at the time.
