A representative for Mr. Spacey did not respond to a request for comment. But the actor has apologized for one incident and denied at least one other accusation of wrongdoing.
Soon after the Globe report was published on Monday, a video was posted on Mr. Spacey’s Twitter account. In the roughly three-minute clip, called “Let Me Be Frank” (a likely reference to Frank Underwood, the character he played on the Netflix show “House of Cards”), Mr. Spacey gives a monologue while wearing an apron and working in the kitchen.
Ms. Unruh did not respond to a request for comment.
 The first was the actor Anthony Rapp, who said Mr. Spacey made an inappropriate sexual advance on him in Mr. Spacey’s apartment in 1986 when he was just 14 years old. Mr. Spacey apologized on Twitter and came out as gay with a statement that came under an avalanche of criticism.
In September, the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office declined to prosecute Mr. Spacey in connection with an allegation that he sexually assaulted a man in West Hollywood in 1992. Mr. Spacey is also reportedly under investigation by the authorities in London for several accusations of inappropriate behavior.
Mr. Spacey’s video on Monday was his first post on Twitter since the post responding to Mr. Rapp in October 2017.
