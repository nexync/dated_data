Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon bring us a very meta acrostic.
ACROSTIC PUZZLE — Today’s scrambled excerpt is from another book I now plan to read (and that’s not always the case), Peter Turchi’s “A Muse and a Maze: Writing as Puzzle, Mystery and Magic.” The notion of the book reminds me, in a pleasant way, of demystifying James Joyce’s “Ulysses” in a college seminar in which an excellent professor exposed the universes of music, mythology, history and mathematics in every chapter.
I didn’t struggle much with the clues today, after getting a good start with TWO BY FOUR, TUPELO, ROYALTIES, ZOLA and NOVA SCOTIA, which happens to be where a good number of my ancestors took root, so it came to mind easily.
It’s more of a crossword term, but this acrostic is a pangram, meaning all 26 letters appeared in the passage, which meant that we got some nice Scrabble words like ABJECT, EXTOL, AGONIZE and ELOQUENT. If that was intended to be an illustration of the excerpt on the part of Team CR, then that was quite subtle and well played.
The funeral for Chuckles the Clown at the top of this post might seem a bit of a non sequitur, but I’m really just following directions!
