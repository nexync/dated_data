Archaeologists have discovered a well-preserved, 4,400-year-old tomb of a royal priest and his family in Egypt, in a “one of a kind” find, the Egyptian authorities announced on Saturday.
The discovery dates from the rule of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the fifth dynasty of ancient Egypt, according to Khaled al-Anani, Egypt’s minister of antiquities. The fifth dynasty governed for less than two centuries, from 2,500 B.C. to about 2,350 B.C., according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The tomb had remained untouched, said Mostafa Waziri, the secretary general of Egypt’s supreme council of antiquities, according to Reuters.
Its near-perfect condition makes it “one of a kind in the last decade,” Mr. Waziri said.
In modern times, as archaeologists started to bring the city’s dead back to light, it became a tourist attraction, with big crowds admiring its famed pyramids and the remnants of an astonishing ancient civilization.
But visitors haven’t been flocking there in the same numbers since the 2011 uprising against then-President Hosni Mubarak. Political problems, and the bombings and terrorist attacks that followed, have made the country an unattractive destination for vacationers.
The authorities hope that the discoveries will help rebrand Egypt’s image as a tourist destination.
