Sierra Tishgart, the co-founder of the colorful new cookware brand Great Jones, shares her family’s recipe for crunchy-but-creamy kugel.
1. Cook noodles al dente and set aside.
2. Mix together cream cheese and sugar, using an electric mixer (or some muscle). Add eggs and milks and continue mixing.
3. Place noodles in a 10.5-inch ovenproof deep sauté pan or casserole dish. Add liquid mixture. Add raisins and gently push down below surface of liquid. Refrigerate casserole for a few hours or overnight before baking.
4. Bake for about 1 hour in preheated oven at 350 degrees. Remove from oven and sprinkle with cinnamon before serving.
