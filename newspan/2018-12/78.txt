MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines joked on Monday about using marijuana to stay awake at official functions, but the punch line appeared lost on a nation where thousands of people have been killed in his antidrug campaign.
 There really is no time,” Mr. Duterte said.
The meetings, he said, start early in the morning and can take up the whole day.
“It’s a killing activity. But at my age, I am not really bothered because I take marijuana to stay awake,” he said to bursts of laughter.
But not everyone was amused by Mr. Duterte’s remarks, which came four days after a Philippine court sentenced three police officers to up to 40 years in prison each for the murder of a 17-year-old boy, the first convictions in Mr. Duterte’s overarching war on drugs. Rights groups say that more than 12,000 people accused of being drug dealers or users have been killed by the police or unofficial militias since Mr. Duterte took office in June 2016.
“If you are making a joke on an issue that has cost the lives of thousands of people in your drug war, then what does that say? You also treat peoples’ lives as a joke,” he said.
Mr. Duterte’s allies quickly came to his defense on social media. Vicente Sotto, the president of the Senate, said it was a “very odd” statement for Mr. Duterte to make because marijuana is generally considered to have a calming rather than stimulative effect.
Mr. Duterte, who has a history of making provocative comments, clarified later Monday that his admission was in jest.
“I use plastic marijuana,” he said.
