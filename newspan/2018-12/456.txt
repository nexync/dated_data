The lead pastors of Churchome Global say the experience it offers doesn’t have to be isolating.
Laura Turner makes the point that in-person church attendance, rather than online, is the only true way to experience the benefits of community that God intended. She assumes that our app, Churchome Global, is an isolating experience.
In today’s transient global society, there are entire segments who want to stay connected to their faith but who travel for work, move, are disabled or, in the case of many millennials, do not believe that going to a church location is important in defining their spirituality.
With Churchome Global, we believe that we can find ways to engage those millennials in an accessible way, whether Bible study, prayer, charity or just meaningful conversation. We can do this where they live — on their mobile devices — on a 24/7/365 basis. And we’re confident that this will lead to real relationships and genuine community.
It is working. We have 518 groups in more than 80 cities across the world, and 20 percent of our user base is in groups.
Luke:15 says God’s arms are open and welcome to all, not just in a physical building but as an emotional place of refuge. And that refuge can be accessed any way, anywhere and any time.
