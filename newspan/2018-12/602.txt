Yet this year's Farm Bill exempts marketing loan gains and loan deficiency payments (generally used by farmers when, because market prices are low, they would rather store than sell their crop) from payment limitations. It also permits farmers’ children and spouses — without ever having set foot on the farm — to count as “actively engaged” in farming, thus qualifying them for $125,000 worth of subsidy payments. It also allows nephews, nieces and cousins to be “daisy chained” in to receive these payments as well.
