In our final “What the Heck Is That?” of 2018, we learn about Alain LeRoy Locke, the writer, educator and philosopher who was one of the originators of the Harlem Renaissance.
Dr. Locke was the first black person to be awarded a Rhodes scholarship, and attended Oxford University, where he earned a second bachelor’s degree in 1910.
When he returned to the United States in 1912, he began a distinguished, 40-year academic career at Howard University and Harvard University, where he was known as an engaging and accessible professor. Dr. Locke was a pioneer in interdisciplinary scholarship, whose work crossed lines between the humanities and social sciences.
In 1925, Dr. Locke edited an anthology of essays, fiction and poetry on African and African-American art and literature called “The New Negro: An Interpretation.” The book explored how African-Americans sought social, political and artistic change, as well as how they attempted to change old stereotypes and replace them with a black identity that was not simplistic.
The writings of Dr. Locke and the other authors of the anthology, including Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Countee Cullen, envisioned the “new Negro” as a people who were proud of their cultural heritage and stood firm on the issue of equal civil rights. At the same time, Dr. Locke challenged African-Americans to integrate into the larger society and accept those outside their ethnic group.
He was also a generous man who served as a mentor to many of the writers he edited.
Dr. Locke died in 1954.
