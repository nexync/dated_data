More records for both wet and dry weather are being set around the globe, often with disastrous consequences for the people facing such extremes, according to a study published Wednesday that offered new evidence of climate change’s impacts in the here and now.
Intense rainfall from hurricanes and other tropical storms can be ruinously costly. Munich Re, the reinsurance giant, said that major tropical storms caused $51 billion in losses worldwide this year, well over the long-term annual average of $34 billion. In 2017, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria together caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage in the United States.
The findings dovetail with another report on Monday that detailed the connections between climate change and recent extreme weather events. That report, which was published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, presented 17 peer-reviewed analyses of weather events around the world. The researchers evaluated heat waves, droughts, flooding and other phenomena and determined, for example, that marine heat waves off the coast of Australia in 2017 and 2018 would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change.
