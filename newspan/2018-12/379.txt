The government writes that its voters cherish the right to vote.
It may have escaped Mr. Lian’s notice, but Hong Kong’s fate was sealed in 1997 when it was handed over to the Chinese Communists, and notwithstanding the promises made to allow the colony some degree of autonomy, Beijing’s heavy hand has continued every year to close into a fist, breaking those promises, bit by bit, almost since the handover itself.
Taiwan’s voters are pragmatic, and their hard-earned democracy allows them to vote incumbents failing to serve their interests out of office. The right to vote is also something that Taiwanese people deeply cherish and are willing to defend.
Taiwan recognizes the threat of disinformation campaigns and is developing countermeasures to strengthen transparency. To think that Taiwan would so easily let go of its freedom is a mistake.
