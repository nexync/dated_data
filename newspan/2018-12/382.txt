Good Friday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• Meng Wanzhou, a top Chinese technology executive, was arrested in Canada at the request of U.S. officials on Saturday — the same day President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China met to discuss a trade truce. The detention may bolster efforts to contain China and Iran, but it could upend trade talks between the world’s two largest economies.
• News of Ms. Weng’s arrest sent stock markets around the world tumbling on Thursday as concerns of an emerging cold war between the United States and China intensified.
• A new study utilizing satellite imagery says North Korea is expanding a missile base that would be one of its most likely sites for deploying intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.
• From the earliest days of his campaign, Mr. Trump has railed against undocumented immigrants. But at one of his New Jersey golf clubs, current and former workers say, undocumented immigrants have made his bed, cleaned his toilet and dusted his golf trophies.
• Elizabeth Warren’s decision to take a DNA test to prove her claims of Native American ancestry was roundly criticized. Publicly, she has stood by her decision. Privately, she and her advisers are worried.
• After fraud allegations cast doubt on the fairness and accuracy of the vote count for the Republican nominee Mark Harris in North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District race, a state G.O.P. official is open to the possibility of a new election.
• Mr. Trump is strongly considering nominating William P. Barr, who served as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, to return to the post. Mr. Barr is a longtime supporter of strengthening executive power.
• In a case with the potential to increase the president’s pardon power, the Supreme Court seemed wary of overruling decisions allowing separate prosecutions for the same crimes by state and federal prosecutors. It could have implications for the legal problems faced by Mr. Trump’s associates.
• Michigan Republicans, following the lead of their Wisconsin counterparts, are forging ahead with several bills that would limit the power of the incoming Democratic secretary of state and set the stage for additional curbs on the Democrats who will take over as governor and attorney general.
• In more bad news for Republicans in California, the party conceded a seventh congressional seat in the state with the incumbent David Valadao’s defeat. Democrats are now likely to take 40 seats from Republicans as they decisively capture control of the House.
• The growth of national health spending, which surged as millions of Americans gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act, is at its lowest since 2013. One contributing factor may be that the share of the population with health insurance has slightly fallen.
• Senators and outside groups are putting pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell to take up a bipartisan criminal justice bill addressing sentencing and prison laws before Congress adjourns. But some Republican leaders are being accused of downplaying the bill’s support to avoid a vote.
