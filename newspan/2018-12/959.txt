Some worry that the city is in danger of becoming a dump. Not a “rubbish heap of history,” or a precious junkyard of antiquities, but an actual garbage dump.
In the historic center, you have more cultural riches, boutiques and cacio e pepe spots than you know what to do with. If you want upscale, on the elegant — if clogged — Viale Parioli, you can sip at the Enoteca Bulzoni, nosh at Ercoli, or feast at the airy Molto. If you’re after what tour companies call the “authentic Roman experience,” go to Testaccio market, grab a sandwich from Mordi e Vai and explore Monte Testaccio, a hill built from broken terra-cotta amphorae — in other words, an ancient trash heap.
