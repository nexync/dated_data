Faye Dunaway will play Katharine Hepburn in a one-person show planned for Broadway next summer, the show’s producer announced on Thursday.
According to the announcement, Ms. Dunaway will star in a revised version of Matthew Lombardo’s “Tea at Five,” to be directed by John Tillinger.
The play had its debut at Hartford Stage in 2002, starring Kate Mulgrew, and later moved Off Broadway.
Mr. Lombardo’s two Broadway productions — “High,” starring Kathleen Turner, and “Looped,” with Valerie Harper as Tallulah Bankhead — had short-lived runs.
More long-running was a legal dispute over “Who’s Holiday!,” his raunchy stage sequel to “How the Grinch Stole Christmas!” by Dr. Seuss. Last year a judge ruled in Mr. Lombardo’s favor, arguing that his work was a parody and didn’t violate copyright, allowing an Off Broadway run.
