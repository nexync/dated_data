A reader writes about his fatherâ€™s habit, acquired during the Great Depression.
Tracking expenses was a way of life for my father, who lived in constant fear of another Great Depression. He recorded his incidental purchases every day for decades.
For instance: In 1944, cigarettes were 18 cents; coffee, 15 cents; five gallons of gas, $1.05; baby sitter, $1; hamburgers, 30 cents; haircut, 70 cents; and March of Dimes, 10 cents.
It worked for him and our family, and we have his little expense books and diaries to prove it.
