The Nets were coming off an emotional overtime win over Toronto on Friday, while the Knicks had not played since Thursday. In this game, it was the Nets who were the better, more in-sync squad.
They used crisp passing to create open shots when they were not driving the lane for layups and drawing fouls. The team made 48.9 percent of its shots from the field (43 for 88) and 50 percent of its 3-pointers (11 for 22).
The Knicks, meanwhile, knocked down 47 percent of their shots (39 for 83) but missed 18 of 26 from 3-point range (30.8 percent).
Each team shot 60 percent from the free-throw line. The Nets made 15 of 25 from the line; the Knicks were 18 for 30.
The Nets led by 10 points, 56-46, at halftime and extended their lead to as many as 19 points in the fourth quarter.
This season, the Nets have not show the ability to close out opponents, while the Knicks have fought back from deficits. Both happened in the fourth quarter, as the Knicks cut the deficit to 5 points, 101-96, on a layup by Frank Ntilikina.
But on the Knicks’ next possession, Dotson missed a driving reverse layup, and on the counterattack Hollis-Jefferson was awarded a basket as Mitchell Robinson was called for defensive goaltending. Immediately after that sequence, Ntilikina missed a 3, and Crabbe countered with a basket from behind the arc that pushed the advantage to 10 points, 106-96.
Still, the Knicks hung in. After Dinwiddie dropped in a layup that extended the Nets’ lead to 110-98 with 2 minutes 16 seconds left, the Knicks scored the next 6 points and closed the deficit to 110-104.
Dinwiddie’s driving dunk following a timeout put the game away.
