A reader says Ireland has a stake in restoring the right.
“Movement to Restore Birthright Citizenship Gains Ground in Ireland” (news article, Nov. 25) relates the effort to undo the restriction on Irish citizenship created by approval of the 27th Amendment to the Irish Constitution; to be properly rescinded, a further amendment will be needed.
Ireland throughout its history has been the beneficiary, and sometimes victim, of arrivals from other lands. One would be hard pressed to find a true “original” Irish person. As with societies across the world, Ireland cannot stand in splendid isolation. Individuals with an array of talents are needed in a time of constant advancement in all fields of endeavor.
Restoring birthright citizenship to those born in Ireland would provide the nation with opportunities to benefit from the talents of the children whose parents sought Ireland as the prime location for their families.
Ireland’s future is not limited to the children of the “Four Green Fields” but to the children of the four corners of the world.
