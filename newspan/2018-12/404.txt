The closing of the Central European University in Hungary by the government of Viktor Orban demands a response by the democratic world that makes it clear that Hungary has declared war on freedom.
Every academic institution, relying on the Four Freedoms defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, must denounce what Mr. Orban has done, as the United States did with Horthy, Rakosi and Kadar when fascism and Communism were in control in Budapest.
This is an appropriate time to impose sanctions. We must isolate Hungary from participating in NATO and the European Union. We should recall our ambassador. The attempted silencing of a great university should be met by an unyielding resistance.
The Hungarian Revolution in 1956 reminds us of the freedom fighters who confronted tyranny. Dictators like Viktor Orban and their anti-Semitic ilk cannot be allowed to harvest their crimes.
