Here are some books that adults and children might want to delve into when that lovable nanny blows into a town near you.
“Mary Poppins Returns” opens this week. And given its cast — the British actress Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda of “Hamilton” musical fame — it’s going to be catnip for many theatergoers, just as the original Disney moving staring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke was more than 50 years ago.
While you’re waiting to see the film, or after you’ve seen it, here are some books that may strike your fancy.
In contemporary literature, at least, nannies and existential dread go together like peanut butter and jelly. Simpson’s novel is about Claire, a new mother who convinces herself that she’s unfit for motherhood and hires a nanny. But eventually she starts to worry that the nanny isn’t up to the job either.
The author P. L. Travers published six Mary Poppins books, and Lawson is determined to tell her story. She’s an intrepid guide to a surprisingly difficult topic: Travers was extremely private and her personal life, though fascinating, was confusing.
A parent’s worst nightmare: The nanny has been taking notes on how you treat your child and, let’s just say, it’s not pretty. But the stories are hilarious, though probably awkward for some to read. When this book was published in 2002 it caused quite an uproar in certain Manhattan circles.
Ripped from the headlines, a nanny snaps and kills the children. But this is more than a psychological thriller, it is an “intimate analysis of the special relationship between a mother and a nanny.” “The Perfect Nanny” is one of The Times’s 10 Best Books of 2018.
