Biographies take center stage in this week’s recommended titles — whether the traditional, magisterial kind that walks readers through the life of a celebrated figure (John Marshall, Saul Bellow) or the more intimate kind that shines attention on a person who might otherwise be overlooked (Scholastique Mukasonga’s mother, Stefania, in “The Barefoot Woman,” or Stephen L. Carter’s grandmother Eunice Carter, in “Invisible”). There’s also a group biography of the fathers of Oscar Wilde, William Butler Yeats and James Joyce, and autobiography in the form of memoir (by Elaine Pagels) and personal essays (by Meghan O’Gieblyn).
We round things out with a novel about politics and sexual violence, Idra Novey’s “Those Who Knew,” and a narrative history, Patricia Miller’s “Bringing Down the Colonel,” touching on some of those same themes in its account of a 19th-century lawsuit that challenged the era’s prevailing notions of gender and sexual mores.
