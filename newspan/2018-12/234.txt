Roberts, who says she was “gutted” to have been accused of plagiarism, spoke to Adeyemi and explained that “Of Blood and Bone” had been titled and delivered to her publisher fully a year before “Children of Blood and Bone” came out. In addition, book titles cannot be copyrighted.
Adeyemi deleted her tweet in early December.
Of course, you see identically titled books all the time. There’s “Life After Life,” novels by Kate Atkinson and Jill McCorkle, which came out months apart in 2013. Gabrielle Zevin called her 2005 novel “Elsewhere,” and seven years later, Richard Russo named his memoir the same thing. Ann Rule used “Possession” in 1983, and so did A.S. Byatt in 1990.
Amazon lists hundreds of books using the phrase “blood and bone” in the title.
