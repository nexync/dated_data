Just before Thanksgiving, Alexa Krugel, 17, handed out paper turkeys at the Edenwald Center, a place in Pleasantville, N.Y., where kids and teenagers with cognitive and behavioral challenges can live and get treatment.
“Do you guys want googly eyes?” she asked residents, who were writing down what they were grateful for on their cutouts. Friends, family, food and volunteers like Alexa were all on the list.
What began as a bat mitzvah project has turned into multiple visits a month to the center, where Alexa puts on activities like craft projects and board games. The work has meant so much to her that she now leads 15 teenage volunteers — and has convinced her mom to come and help too. Alexa has rarely missed a visit in 5 years.
The center is run by JCCA, formerly the Jewish Child Care Association, a beneficiary of UJA-Federation New York, which receives funds from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Founded in 1911, The Times’s fund raises money for people of all ages and backgrounds.
