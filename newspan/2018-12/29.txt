The trip so nice we’re doing it twice.
For the second year in a row, we’re sending one lucky traveler to all 52 destinations on our annual Places to Go list. (Jada Yuan, our first Traveler, just finished her 52nd and final stop.) We got hundreds of applications from people around the world, with an impressive variety of backgrounds. We’ve picked our traveler — look out for the announcement soon — but in the meantime, we thought you might want to meet some of our favorite candidates.
