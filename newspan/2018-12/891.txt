Here’s yet another reason to visit Detroit next year: the debut of a major hotel project from Shinola, the Michigan-based luxury goods company whose headquarters are about three miles south. The property, designed by Shinola, along with the firms Gachot Studios and Kraemer Design Group, is on the city’s historic Woodward Avenue and encompasses a duo of restored buildings — the brick-fronted, 1915 former T.B. Rayl Co. department store and a former Singer sewing-machine factory. The 129 guest rooms reflect the brand’s Americana aesthetic, outfitted with Shinola clocks and turntables (a nod to Detroit’s music heritage), striped alpaca blankets, leather throw pillows, custom-made candles and bathroom fixtures that resemble watch case backs.
