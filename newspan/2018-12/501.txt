BOSTON — Kyrie Irving heard all of the doubts when the Celtics, who were among the favorites to win the Eastern Conference, still had a .500 record through Thanksgiving.
The low point may have been a home loss to the Knicks that ended their six-game losing streak.
Irving also had eight assists before leaving the game with about four minutes left, rubbing his right shoulder and swinging it around in pain. He raised his hand for Coach Brad Stevens to take him out of the game but couldn’t get his attention and instead walked to the bench at the next whistle.
The shoulder was wrapped in ice when he walked off the court at the end of the game. Irving thought it was his AC joint and said he would be all right.
Tim Hardaway Jr. scored 22 for the Knicks, who have lost four of their last five games. Enes Kanter had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and Noah Vonleh had 12 and 10.
The Celtics scored the first three baskets of the game and never trailed. They led by 8 after one, by 11 after two and by 15 points after scoring 8 straight to make it 97-82 near the end of the third quarter.
The Knicks were within 12 with five minutes remaining before Boston scored the next 11 points on baskets from five different players.
The Celtics, who went to the Eastern Conference finals last year, were expected to be one of the league’s top teams after getting Irving and Gordon Hayward back from injuries. But the Knicks won, 117-109, in Boston on Nov. 21, sending the Celtics to their third loss in a row.
“Maybe it’s not a wake-up call if you keep getting beat,” he said.
