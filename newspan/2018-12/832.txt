CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Kemba Walker scored 29 points and made seven 3-pointers, Tony Parker had 17 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter, and the Charlotte Hornets avenged a double-overtime loss to the Nets earlier this week with a 100-87 victory on Friday night.
Jeremy Lamb added 19 points, and Cody Zeller had 14 points and 10 rebounds as Charlotte improved to 13-7 at home.
D’Angelo Russell scored 33 points on 13-of-24 shooting for the Nets, who lost for only the second time in the last 11 games.
The Hornets won despite an off night from their bench. Aside from Parker, Charlotte’s reserves were 3 of 21 from the field.
The Hornets (17-17) bounced back from the loss in Brooklyn on Wednesday, when Joe Harris stole a loose ball at midcourt and drove for the go-ahead layup with 3.4 seconds left in the second overtime for a 134-132 victory.
Charlotte seemed extra motivated coming out of the gates, jumping out to a 35-17 lead in the first quarter behind 15 points from Lamb and 10 from Zeller. The Hornets never trailed in the game.
The Nets didn’t help themselves, shooting 24 percent in the opening quarter.
But the Nets would battle back to cut the lead to 5 midway through the fourth quarter behind 11 points from Shabazz Napier. That’s when Parker, an 18-year veteran, took over, scoring on midrange jumpers and drives to the hole. Parker shot eight of 10 from the field in the fourth quarter.
