Many of the holiday movies we consider classics or cult favorites today did not seem destined for such glory when we first reviewed them. Some we panned. Others were flops. Others just weren’t particularly holiday-focused.
“Black Christmas,” which landed on local screens a year after its release in Canada where it was produced, is a whodunit that begs the question of why it was made.
The answer is hard to come by. This moody depiction of the Christmas slayings of university sorority sisters and their housemother, among others, is as murky as the script, which dotes largely on obscenities that are no more pointed than the violence, dull direction and pedestrian performances.
Why this skulking psychopath is driven to making explicitly obscene phone calls in a variety of crazed voices to the girls before dispatching them remains a fairly foggy business. The slightly comic, alcoholic housemother, Marian Waldman, and Margot Kidder, who is also a drunk and as blatantly outspoken as the killer, and Andrea Martin and Lynne Griffin as the other victims, are obvious in perfunctory portrayals.
 But Keir Dullea, the neurotic music student-lover she rejects, does little but rant about the prospective child she doesn’t want and smash his piano in a fit of rage.
 Considering the ersatz tension and plotting, “Black Christmas” is hardly worth the efforts of all concerned.
