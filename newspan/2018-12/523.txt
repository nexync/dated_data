— From “The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling: A Hardcore, High-Flying, No-Holds-Barred History of the One True Sport” (Ten Speed Press, 2018, Page 33), by Aubrey Sitterson and Chris Moreno.
The wrestling term “kayfabe” has a perfect origin story: Nobody knows exactly where it came from. It is almost, but not quite, pig Latin for “fake.” It looks more like the word “fake” caught in a suplex, picked up and twisted around, then slammed down into a new shape with a dislocated meaning.
This, in fact, is not a bad description. To “keep kayfabe” is to insist — heroically or foolishly, angelically or devilishly — that what is happening in professional wrestling is actually real.
 “There is no more a problem of truth in wrestling than in the theater,” Roland Barthes wrote way back in 1952. And yet these theatrical scripts are performed by skilled athletes with superhero musculature, and the altercations are so dangerous that wrestlers sometimes — in very nonfake ways — die or get paralyzed or suffer debilitating brain damage.
To keep kayfabe is a devotion to reality so extreme that it circles all the way back to artifice, or maybe vice versa. It is to insist that your best friend is your mortal enemy, that the blow that missed your face by five inches actually shattered your nose. It is to surf the crest of the mystical wave between being and pretending.
Given that each of us performs this stunt, in small ways, every day — we pretend that paperwork is vitally important, or that a joke is 30 percent funnier than it is — it can be satisfying to see the tendency demonstrated in such an extreme form: giant meat piles kayfabing with unapologetic gusto, playacting for us our own universal instinct for playacting.
