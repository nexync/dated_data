• The case against President Trump.
In a litany of memos on Friday, prosecutors effectively accused the president of defrauding voters, questioning the legitimacy of his victory. Prosecutors in Manhattan said that during the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump directed Michael Cohen, his former lawyer, to make illegal hush payments to two women to suppress stories of affairs with him.
And the office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, said that Mr. Trump continued to secretly seek to do business in Russia deep into his presidential campaign, even as Russian agents sought to influence the election.
Together, the legal filings laid bare the most direct evidence to date linking Mr. Trump to potentially criminal conduct, and added to an already substantial case that Russia was seeking to sway the 2016 election in his favor.

• How the Saudi crown prince wooed Jared Kushner.
In the early months of the Trump administration, Mr. Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and Middle East adviser, had private, informal conversations with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, according to three former White House officials. Above, the prince and Mr. Kushner.
Despite resistance from senior American officials, the exchanges continued even after Oct. 2, when the dissident Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Mr. Kushner has served as the prince’s most important defender inside the White House.
The prince long cultivated ties with Mr. Kushner, according to documents, text messages and emails reviewed by The Times. The evidence shows that, as early as the month Mr. Trump was elected president, a delegation close to the prince identified Mr. Kushner as the ideal insider, because he had little knowledge of the region, a transactional mind-set and an intense focus on reaching an Israel-Palestine deal.
• The Brexit vote looms.
Protesters from Britain’s left and right took to the streets over the weekend, offering starkly different visions of the country’s future. Above, pro-Brexit demonstrators.
Parliament is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the government’s plans to leave the European Union. Prime Minister Theresa May and her team have been scrambling to shore up support for her compromise deal, which they’re painting as the best possible alternative to a potentially disastrous “no deal” exit.
→ Go deeper: The economic grievances that inspired the Brexit movement in the first place remain unchanged. Our reporter traveled to Sunderland, a deprived northern city that voted 61 percent to 39 percent to leave the E.U. He found many voters frustrated that Mrs. May’s deal would not deliver the windfall they were promised during the campaign.
• Beijing’s delicate balancing act.
The Chinese government on Sunday summoned the U.S. ambassador, Terry Branstand, pictured above with his wife, to protest the surprise detention of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of the company’s founder.
But the government also appeared intent on maintaining a recent thaw in trade tensions, offering praise for economic relations with the U.S. through a senior adviser.
Ms. Meng, who until recently was seen as the polished face of one of China’s most celebrated companies, was arrested in Canada a little over a week ago at the request of the U.S. She is suspected of participating in a scheme to trick financial institutions into making transactions that violated U.S. sanctions against Iran.
→ Coming up: This month, Chinese leaders are preparing to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the country’s post-Mao economic reforms with a series of moves to further open the economy. How far they will go hasn’t been clear, and Ms. Meng’s arrest may shift their calculations.
• A Monet, a $250 million yacht, a see-through grand piano: The many flamboyant possessions, pictured above, of the Malaysian financier Jho Low, who prosecutors say helped orchestrate the vast money-laundering scheme involving 1MDB, the Malaysian development fund, are being tracked down and seized by the U.S. government.

This evening in Stockholm, Nobel laureates will feast on a banquet with Swedish royalty after receiving their Nobel Prizes. It’s one of many traditions associated with the 117-year-old honors.
But another — in which laureates are awoken at the Grand Hotel Stockholm by girls in white carrying candles — may be fading into history.
The ceremony reflects an annual Swedish custom honoring St. Lucia, who represents the triumph of light over darkness. Above, the Nobel laureate in chemistry William Knowles receiving the Queen of Lights in 2001.
But a manager at the hotel said that this year’s edition was canceled “due to fire risk” in the laureates’ rooms. A version will still take place in the lobby and one of the hotel’s restaurants.
Not every Nobel Laureate has enjoyed the wake-up call.
When white-clad maidens came to the American novelist Saul Bellow in 1976, for example, he was irritated.
“I scowled, and then my face formed the smile which is obligatory on such occasions,” he later told a biographer.
