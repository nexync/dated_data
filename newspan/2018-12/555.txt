A surprise appearance by the Duchess of Sussex at Britain’s answer to the Met Gala provided a brief respite and much cheer at a time when the country faces an uncertain future.
It’s a sentiment that was echoed by Miuccia Prada, who received the outstanding achievement award after 40 years as the creative leader of her family company; Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino, designer of the year; Kim Jones, Dior Men’s artistic director, winner of the Trailblazer award; Kaia Gerber, surrounded by her family, who scooped the prize for model of the year; and Virgil Abloh, artistic director of men's wear at Louis Vuitton, who took home the Urban Luxe award for his work at Off-White.
