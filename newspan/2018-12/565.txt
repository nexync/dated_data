Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, joined a bipartisan group of senators in voting to withdraw military aid to Saudi Arabia for its war in Yemen. The move comes amid the mounting criticism against the Trump administration for its defense of the kingdom since the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.
We cannot sweep under the rug the callous disregard for human life and flagrant violations of international norms the Saudis have shown. Saudi Arabia has joined a sinister clique; along with North Korea, Russia and Iran, in its assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. A few more weapons purchases cannot buy our silence. It should not buy our silence and if the president will not, Congress must act.
