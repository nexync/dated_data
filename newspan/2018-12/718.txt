For most of the year, Dr. Charles Nuttall is a trained nephrologist and a clinical research consultant to pharmaceutical companies. He is also an actor, model, photographer, and lest we forget, a Nobel Peace Prize recipient, having won the award in 1985 as part of a group of doctors and medical workers who formed to prevent nuclear war. And for the past four years, Dr. Nuttall has taken on an extra role: Santa Claus. Between Dec. 16 and 23, he suits up for Santa’s Corner, part of the holiday market in Bryant Park. “You can say I’m sort of an accidental Santa,” he said. “I never intended to grow up to look like Santa, but since it happened I’ve decided to make the most of it.” Dr. Nuttall, 73, lives on the Upper East Side with his wife, Marcia Lerner, 63, in a building once occupied by Rube Goldberg.
