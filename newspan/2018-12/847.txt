CBS News reached a legal settlement with three women who accused the network of not doing enough to stop one of its anchors, Charlie Rose, from sexually harassing them.
The network fired Mr. Rose last year after The Washington Post published the stories of several women who said that Mr. Rose had treated them inappropriately when they worked for him over the course of several decades. PBS, the longtime home of the “Charlie Rose” interview show, also cut ties with Mr. Rose.
Three recent employees — Katherine Harris, Sydney McNeal and Yuqing Wei — sued the network and Mr. Rose this year after another article in The Post indicated that the network had ignored complaints from CBS employees who worked with him.
Christa Robinson, a spokeswoman for CBS News, said on Tuesday that the CBS lawsuit was “resolved” and that the financial terms of the settlement were confidential, at the request of the women.
Although CBS is no longer a defendant in the lawsuit, the women are continuing to pursue their claims against Mr. Rose, a lawyer for the women, Kenneth Goldberg, said.
The settlement is the latest domino to fall in the reckoning over whether CBS and other television networks did enough to stop senior executives and broadcast personalities from harassing younger employees.
Last week, The New York Times reported that Leslie Moonves, the former chief executive of CBS, had destroyed evidence pointing to his own sexual misconduct when he was running the network. A draft of a report by lawyers hired by CBS said the company had justification to deny Mr. Moonves his $120 million severance.
Mr. Moonves stepped down from his post in September after several women came forward in The New Yorker with sexual misconduct claims against him.
In the lawsuit against Mr. Rose and CBS, some of the former anchorman’s subordinates said the network had known about the allegations against Mr. Rose before they became public and did nothing.
