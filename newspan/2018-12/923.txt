An article on Nov. 27 about the Chinese researcher He Jiankui, using information provided by two sources, including an organizer of a conference on genome engineering, misstated the year in which Dr. He spoke at that conference. He spoke about his work on human embryo editing at a conference at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 2017, not 2018. Because of that error, the premise of a quote by Fyodor Urnov was incorrect. Dr. He was speaking in 2017 before a woman in China was carrying twins whose genes had been edited; he was not concealing that he had already completed the procedure.
An article on Thursday about Republicans in Wisconsin limiting the power of the governor misstated the day on which a North Carolina judge struck down part of a series of legislative changes. It was Wednesday, not Tuesday.
An obituary on Thursday about the longtime New York Public Library art curator Robert Rainwater misstated the name of a French printmaker whose work he exhibited. He was FÃ©lix Buhot, not Puhot. The obituary also misstated the name of the club in Manhattan where Mr. Rainwater celebrated Christmas with friends. It is the Century Association, not the Century Club.
