The Ohio teenager has been accused of live-streaming a rape with the social media app Periscope.
“I have never seen a case such as this where you would actually live-stream a sexual assault,” Ron O’Brien, the Franklin County prosecutor, said in remarks to the local news media.
The prosecutor’s office said Ms. Lonina and the victim, friends from the same high school outside Columbus, met Mr. Gates for the first time while hanging out at a shopping mall in the city, the day before the alleged assault. He proposed meeting the next day.
On the evening of Feb. 27, all three were gathered at a residence in Columbus where Mr. Gates pinned the 17-year-old down and raped her as Ms. Lonina used Periscope, an app owned by Twitter, to live-stream the attack, the authorities said.
A friend of Ms. Lonina’s in another state saw the video and contacted the authorities.
Both defendants pleaded not guilty on Friday.
Ms. Lonina’s lawyer, Sam Shamansky, has portrayed his client as the victim of a much older man, who bought the teenagers a bottle of vodka.
“You don’t want to lose track of the fact that she’s a high school student and she and her friend were clearly taken advantage of,” he said.
Ms. Lonina told the police that she filmed the encounter to gather evidence of a crime. Mr. Shamansky, who has viewed the Periscope video, said Ms. Lonina made “substantial” efforts to thwart the attack, though he declined to specify them.
Ms. Lonina did not call 911, he added.
Court records showed no attorney listed for Mr. Gates.
The authorities also charged Ms. Lonina with an additional felony for photographing her friend in the nude on Feb. 26, the night before the assault, Mr. O’Brien said.
The defendants each face more than 40 years in prison if convicted, Mr. O’Brien said. Court records show Ms. Lonina was released Friday on a bond of $125,000, while Mr. Gates remained incarcerated after his bond was set at $300,000.
