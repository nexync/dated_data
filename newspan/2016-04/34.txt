Brian Eno had no master plan when he started what became his new album, “The Ship” (Warp). In fact, he wasn’t even thinking about an album: just “sound in space,” he said in a telephone interview. “You set out to do one thing and you find that you’ve actually done something else completely different,” he said with a laugh. Then he explained the labyrinthine path to making the record, which will be released on Friday.
Mr. Eno, who turns 68 on May 15, has had a prolific and influential career as a producer, songwriter, musician, visual artist and thinker. Along with his own solo albums of songs and instrumentals, he has produced landmark rock albums with Talking Heads, U2 and David Bowie and collaborated extensively lately with dance-music figures like Karl Hyde, from Underworld, and the producer Jon Hopkins. His catalog has something for every attention span. He composed the evocative six-second start-up sound for Windows 95; he is also a pioneer of sustained, nearly motionless ambient music and of computerized video art like “77 Million Paintings,” a title that undercounts the number of slowly evolving images it can eventually display.
The music of “The Ship” is tolling and elegiac, while “Fickle Sun,” with lyrics about the “dismal work” of a soldier’s life, is in constant metamorphosis. Electronic sounds melt into orchestral upheavals and guitar distortion; voices, natural and synthetic, loom from all directions. It’s a rare Eno piece that revolves around contrast rather than homogeneity: “I liked the fact that things happened which you weren’t expecting, and they jutted out at you,” he said.
Even with his catalog?
