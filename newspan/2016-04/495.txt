Film buffs soon will have a new viewing option for contemporary and classic movies with the start of a streaming service called FilmStruck this fall.
FilmStruck also will be the exclusive streaming destination for Criterion Collection, which specializes in licensing classic and contemporary films. Criterion will operate a channel on the service to spotlight more than 1,000 films and other content such as commentary on films and filmmakers.
The service will be advertising free. Specific pricing details are still being determined.
