A former volunteer deputy for a sheriff’s office in Tulsa, Okla., who fatally shot a suspect by accidentally firing his handgun instead of a Taser, was convicted on Wednesday of second-degree manslaughter, the volunteer’s defense lawyer said..
The volunteer, Robert C. Bates, 74, was a reserve deputy with the Tulsa County sheriff’s office when the shooting happened on April 2, 2015, during an illegal gun sales sting. He faces up to four years in prison.
The shooting was captured on video by a body camera worn by another deputy. It showed the suspect, Eric C. Harris, 44, who had fled from deputies, being knocked to the ground and ordered to roll on his stomach as officers struggled to subdue him.
Mr. Harris, who was black, was unarmed. Mr. Bates is white.
The defense called Mr. Harris’s death an “excusable homicide” and argued that methamphetamine in his system and his cardiac health caused his death, The Associated Press reported.
Mr. Bates’s lawyer, Clark O. Brewster, said an appeal would be filed.
The shooting prompted several investigations, which revealed that Mr. Bates, a close friend of Sheriff Stanley Glanz and a volunteer reserve deputy since 2008, had donated thousands of dollars in cash, vehicles and equipment. Also discovered was a 2009 memo that questioned Mr. Bates’s qualifications.
A grand jury recommended that Sheriff Glanz be removed from office. He was charged with two misdemeanors for refusing to release the 2009 report and for false expense reimbursements. He resigned on Nov. 1. Vic Regalado, who was sworn in as the new sheriff on April 11, has outlined plans to reform and restore the reserve deputy program.
