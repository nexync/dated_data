Lindsay Morris, a freelance photographer, said she first got the idea for her latest project after a group of people rushed into her living room last year, twice. She recognized these people: mothers from her children’s school; faces she saw at the post office and other local places. On those two occasions, they were rushing to Ms. Morris’s house as members of the Sag Harbor Volunteer Ambulance Corps, to administer emergency care to members of her family.
