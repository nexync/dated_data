One hundred years ago, mountain water from the Catskills began flowing into the cupped hands of New York City.
Since those days, New Yorkers have come to take their water for granted, boasting that what comes out of the tap is “the champagne of drinking water.” But with the revelations of contamination in the water supplies of Flint, Mich., and closer to home, in Hoosick Falls, N.Y., and in schools in Newark, water management is again on people’s minds.
Beginning in the 1830s, the city acquired land north of the city, away from the fetid urban wells contaminated by animal carcasses and human and industrial waste. At the time, Lower Manhattan’s rapidly expanding population was plagued by yellow fever, cholera and devastating fires.
Nine and a half million people consume what has been called the champagne of drinking water. We took a look at its journey from source to tap.
In 1907, construction began on a network of reservoirs, tunnels and an aqueduct that would deliver clean water from nearly 100 miles away. For nearly a decade, thousands of workers lived in camps along the route from the Ashokan Reservoir to the Bronx to build the Catskill system. The cost: $177 million, about $4 billion today.
Protecting the fragile lands surrounding the lakes, rivers and streams — the city’s watershed — from sewage, storm water runoff and other pollutants from encroaching civilization remains a priority. “It’s a much more sustainable way, and an economical way, to provide for high-quality drinking water,” Mr. Rush said.
To Jim Roberts, who runs the city’s water and sewer operations, the payoff comes first thing each morning, when many of the 9.5 million people in the city and the counties that surround it turn on their showers, and their faucets to make coffee, with scarcely a second thought.
“Nobody knows we’re out there,” Mr. Roberts said.
