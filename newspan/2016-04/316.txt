The Led Zeppelin song “Stairway to Heaven” is one of the most ubiquitous (some might say overplayed) songs on classic rock radio. 
A federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that it will be up to the jurors to determine whether the song stole elements of “Taurus,” a track from the band Spirit.
A trustee for Spirit’s guitarist, Randy Wolfe, brought the suit against the surviving members of Led Zeppelin in 2014. Mr. Wolfe died in 1997.
The trial, scheduled for May 10, would be the second high-profile jury trial to determine the similarity between two songs in two years, a trend industry experts say may open the gates to more suits.
Led Zeppelin has a long history of being sued and accused of being a little too enamored with the work of other artists, including the folk singer Anne Bredon and the blues songwriter Willie Dixon. Both musicians found success against the band in court.
“Stairway to Heaven” was recorded between December 1970 and January 1971, and was first performed in March 1971, according to court documents. Before that, Led Zeppelin and Spirit toured the same venues and played on the same days at least three times, the documents said.
But the members of Led Zeppelin said that “they never toured with, shared a stage with or listened to any of Spirit’s music during these brief encounters,” according to the court documents.
The members of Spirit recalled things differently, however, asserting that they had talked with members of Led Zeppelin backstage and that the bands had performed one after the other at two festivals.
Lawyers for Mr. Skidmore also presented a quote from an interview that the Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page gave in 1970.
The federal judge in Los Angeles, however, dismissed the quote as hearsay.
