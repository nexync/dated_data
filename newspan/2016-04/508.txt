HONG KONG — It was not intended as a joke. But on April Fools’ Day, it’s hard to be certain.
The message quickly received thousands of reposts and comments. Some people endorsed the rejection of a Western celebration, while others embraced April Fools’. Many did not take the state news agency seriously.
“Xinhua is in fact celebrating Fool’s Day itself,” wrote Zhao Yan, a television writer in Guangdong Province.
“This is the funniest joke I’ve seen all day,” another person wrote on Weibo.
April Fools’ isn’t celebrated in China except by a small number of people, generally college students who might use it as an excuse to pull pranks.
The rejection of April Fools’ Day also reflects persistent concerns about the spread of rumors and false stories online.
In 2013, China issued guidelines calling for up to three years’ imprisonment for anyone who posts rumors that are reposted by more than 500 people or seen more than 5,000 times. People have been punished for posting about aliens and zombies, among some of the more elaborate online hoaxes.
Some people who read Xinhua’s statement on Friday were not sure if the news agency was inadvertently engaging in exactly the type of activity it was warning against.
