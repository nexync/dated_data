Rachel Lisa Becker and Stephen Bradley Kamsler are to be married April 17. Rabbi Alex Freedman is to perform the ceremony at Temple Emanu-El in Closter, N.J.
The bride, 36, who is taking the groom’s name, is the social-media marketing director for New York Media, the parent company of New York magazine. She graduated from Emory University. She is the daughter of Phyllis S. Becker and Michael I. Becker of Wyckoff, N.J.
The groom, 42, is a copywriter in the marketing and advertising group in Manhattan for HBO. He graduated from Syracuse University. He is a son of Estelle L. Kamsler of Commack, N.Y., and Irving H. Kamsler of the Bronx.
The couple met — eventually — after Mr. Kamsler sent Ms. Becker an email in February 2014, after having stumbled upon her fitness and style blog, Strength & Sole, for which she had written a review of a cycling studio on the Upper East Side that Mr. Kamsler’s triathlon trainer owned.
After Mr. Kamsler finished reading her review, he began browsing through other articles Ms. Becker had posted and soon became a fan of her blog. Maybe even too much of a fan.
Soon, the two were chatting at a restaurant and bar in her Chelsea neighborhood.
Their relationship bloomed around a shared love of fitness: running in Hudson River Park, taking spin classes together and even engaging in intense boot-camp-type exercise sessions.
But her dog, Maddie, was asked to be the ultimate arbiter of the couple’s compatibility. Ms. Becker, who is a self-described Type A personality, got Maddie on a whim. “It was really out of character for me,” she said.
So she wanted to make sure that Mr. Kamsler was truly ready to commit — to her dog.
