Clémence von Mueffling, 37, is a third generation beauty editor. Born in Paris, she was introduced to body creams, toners and fragrances at an early age — both her mother and grandmother served as beauty editors at Vogue Paris from the late ‘50s through the early ‘90s. “I remember them telling me that there was a code among the women who worked there — they were all incredibly elegant and polished,” says von Mueffling. Still, she didn’t immediately pursue the same career path: Instead she spent nearly five years on the marketing and communications side at brands like Clarins and Dior before moving to New York in 2007 and assuming the beauty editor role at Casas & Gente, an interiors and lifestyle magazine that’s since folded. But her six-year stint there sparked the idea to start a magazine-like website, Beauty and Well Being, which von Mueffling launched in 2014.
With a deep appreciation for all things non-toxic and natural, holistic views on fitness and motherhood (von Mueffling has 5-year-old twins, Lucas and Anaïs), and profiles of influencers and the products they love, the site is a bit like a French version of Goop meets Into the Gloss. Here, von Mueffling shares her best advice on spring beauty, along with some time-honored tips passed down in her family.
