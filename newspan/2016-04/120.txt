Richard W. Painter’s claim (Op-Ed, March 23) that President George W. Bush would have nominated a judge like Merrick B. Garland, who was appointed to the Court of Appeals by President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, to a late-term Supreme Court vacancy is simply implausible.
Mr. Painter’s speculation requires the belief that President Bush would have abandoned his clear and consistently expressed view — which was based upon fundamental beliefs about the nature of American government — that his Supreme Court nominees must be judicial conservatives who shared the president’s understanding of the proper role of the courts in our system.
President Bush believed that judges should act as law interpreters and not lawmakers, and that they do so by using the text of the Constitution and case law. Anybody who knew the slightest about President Bush’s mind on judicial appointments would have expected to be laughed out of the Oval Office for suggesting nominating someone like Judge Garland.
While there is no question that Judge Garland is an accomplished judge, his judicial philosophy, as reflected in his 19-year record on the Court of Appeals, is not that of a judicial conservative.
