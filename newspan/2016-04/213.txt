Leonard A. Lauder, the Whitney Museum of American Art’s chairman emeritus, initially opposed the museum’s move downtown to its new home in the Meatpacking district from the Breuer building on Madison Avenue.
Now, that new home will bear his name.
On Tuesday evening, at a dinner honoring Mr. Lauder, the Whitney announced that the Renzo Piano-designed museum, which opened last May, would be called the Leonard A. Lauder Building.
How to explain this turn of events?
In addition to contributing $131 million toward the building, Mr. Lauder is among the museum’s biggest contributors of art.
