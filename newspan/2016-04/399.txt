A 21-year-old Swiss snowboarding champion was killed by an avalanche in the Swiss Alps on Tuesday morning.
The athlete, Estelle Balet, died while filming a movie on Le Portalet, a mountain above the village of Orsières, in southwestern Switzerland, near the country’s border with France and Italy, according to the police in the canton of Valais.
Ms. Balet was following another snowboarder, who was not injured, when she was struck by the avalanche, the police said. Emergency workers were summoned shortly after 8 a.m., and Air Glaciers, an air ambulance service, arrived on the scene and extracted her from the snow. Efforts to revive her were unsuccessful.
Ms. Balet had special safety equipment, including an airbag, and she was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, the police said. An investigation is underway.
Extreme skiing and snowboarding, especially in areas away from marked trails, can be particularly dangerous.
Ms. Balet was a champion in freeriding, a style of snowboarding that occurs on natural terrain, without a predefined course. It eschews jumps, rails, half-pipes and other features of traditional competitive skiing, and it is generally considered more dangerous.
“Estelle Balet was a naturally gifted shining star and demonstrated remarkable talent as she quickly became a household name on the Freeride World Tour, bringing home her second title as World Champion just a few weeks ago in Verbier,” the Freeride World Tour said in a statement.
