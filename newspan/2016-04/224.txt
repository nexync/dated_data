John Kander’s newest musical, “Kid Victory,” will make its New York debut in September as part of the Vineyard Theater’s 2016-7 season.
Mr. Kander, 89, who composed the music for “Cabaret” and “Chicago,” wrote “Kid Victory” with Gregory Pierce after their previous 2013 collaboration, “The Landing,” which also ran at the Vineyard Theater. “Kid Victory” will be directed by Liesl Tommy and follows a teenager returning to his Kansas hometown.
Nicky Silver’s “This Day Forward” will receive its world premiere at the Vineyard sometime next winter. Mark Brokaw will direct; the pair previously collaborated on “The Lyons,” which ran at the Vineyard before transferring to Broadway in 2012.
The season will be rounded out next spring by Gina Gionfriddo’s “Can You Forgive Her?,” which will be directed by Peter Dubois. The play is set on Halloween night.
