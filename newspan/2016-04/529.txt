Good morning on this wet Thursday.
Love it or hate it, tipping is part of the economic fabric of our city.
Sorting it out can be puzzling.
First, how do you know whom to tip?
“When you ask someone to do something for you, tip,” said Douglas Stallings, who writes about tipping etiquette for Fodor’s travel guides.
Ask for a coffee? Tip.
Didn’t ask for that taxi door to be opened? No need.
Of course, what to give varies.
For dining, he suggests a minimum of 18 percent, but “for high-end places, it’s 20 percent,” he said.
So many other daily exchanges, though, are often head scratchers.
Elizabeth Charrow, 34, a barista at Joe Coffee in Greenwich Village, said she appreciates a dollar a drink.
For Luis Maisonet, 52, a doorman in the West Village, it’s the thought that counts, he said.
Antonio Romero, 33, a deliveryman on the Upper West Side, said he was happy with $2 to $3 a trip.
Out-of-towners are good for 5 percent to 10 percent, he said.
Locals are more generous, leaving around 10 percent to 20 percent.
“And we’re always happy to pick up New Yorkers,” he said.
Hair forecast: frizz.
It’ll be a muggy 58 degrees: We may get some showers in the morning, and are likely to see more in the afternoon and evening, with a thunderstorm possible around lunchtime.
Here’s to hoping that April showers really do bring May flowers.

Times Square can be a jungle sometimes.
Now it sounds like it, too.
This month, visitors to Times Square can download a location-tracking app that syncs up their walking tour to sounds of the Amazon rain forest.
You’re hearing a swamp in the Mamori rain forest at night.
