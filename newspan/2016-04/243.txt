The music historian Richard T. Pinnell called “Memphis” “a milestone in early rock guitar” in Guitar Player magazine in 1979. Just as influential was “Wham!”, also from 1963, with its flamboyant use of a vibrato bar, a device that became known as a whammy bar.
Several of his instrumentals, as well as the soul vocals “Where There’s a Will,” “Satisfied” and “Why?” were collected on “The Wham of That Memphis Man!” The album was reissued as a collector’s edition, with additional tracks, by the Elektra label in 1969.
A rave review of “The Wham of That Memphis Man!” in Rolling Stone magazine in 1968 led to bookings at the Fillmore East and West and a contract with Elektra, where he recorded three albums and played bass guitar on the song “Roadhouse Blues,” by the Doors.
Mr. Mack was married and divorced three times. He is survived by two sisters, Audrey Pratt and Burlis Britton; a brother, Bill McIntosh; three sons, George Mack, Harry McIntosh and Eric Wilson; two daughters, Holly McIntosh and Lonita Coldwell; 8 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.
