After 10 years of insular, auteur-ish electronica and plangent post-rock, the French musician Anthony Gonzalez, of the project M83, broke through in 2011 with the double album “Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming.” It presented his vision most effectively: electronic music that avoided dance tempos and swiped gestures from ’70s and ’80s pop, without being too coy and indie about it. (The album may have been the capstone for the dreamy ’80s-revisionist subgenre that the Internet called chillwave.) His goal seemed to be intensely suburban rite-of-passage emotion rendered in anthemic gestures, music that film and television producers wouldn’t be able to resist, and he got there; his IMDB page, full of licensing information, proves it.
In the end, Mr. Gonzalez’s kind of dreaminess wasn’t blurry detachment: It was detail-oriented professionalism. “Junk” — perversely, knowingly titled — expands somewhat on the strengths of “Hurry Up,” balancing Italo-disco chill-out atmospheres and calibrated buildups and releases. This happens especially in songs like “Go!” and “Bibi the Dog,” the first with a shredding guitar improvisation by Steve Vai, and both with vocals by the French singer Mai Lan. But these are just more chic, soggy dreams, with tinctures of moodiness.
What’s really arresting here is the corny stuff. Several songs seem written for imaginary Carpenters albums, or early-’80s television shows, or New Age misadventures. There is some skill here: strong melodies, extra chords, synthesized string arrangements, a tremendously accomplished chromatic-harmonica solo. They are intense.
Mr. Gonzalez knows how to make you tingle; it’s almost too easy. What he seems to be working on now is making you cringe, such that you pay attention to his details and seek out the feeling again.
