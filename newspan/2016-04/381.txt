The America’s Cup sailing races will be held in New York City, for the first time since 1920, on Saturday, May 7 and Sunday, May 8. Officially called the Louis Vuitton America’s Cup World Series, the event is a preliminary competition among the six countries — the United States, Britain, France, Japan, New Zealand and Sweden — competing in the 35th America’s Cup, held every four years, in Bermuda next June; the teams race on boats that are about 45 feet long and have a 70-foot-high mast, according to the America’s Cup commercial commissioner, Harvey Schiller. “Watching these vessels speed through the water is quite a spectacle,” he said.
No tickets are necessary to view the races. They take place rain or shine and will be held from 2 to 3:30 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday on the Hudson River. Spectators can take in most of the action in areas in and around Battery Park City.
-The Brookfield Place Waterfront Plaza in downtown Manhattan is the heart of the race festivities and an ideal vantage point.
-On the New York City side of the Hudson River, the races will be viewable as far south as Pier A and as far north as Pier 25, both on Manhattan’s West Side. Spectators can watch from several waterfront areas along the river.
-On the New Jersey side, the races can be seen from Liberty State Park up to the Jersey City waterfront.
-Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty are also good viewing points, according to Mr. Schiller.
-Several large screens along the waterfront, including a few in parks — the exact parks are still being determined — where families are encouraged to picnic while they watch, will provide an up-close view of the action.
Racegoers can also watch from their own boats on the Hudson River; there’s no fee to do so. For more details and to register, visit www.americascup.com/en/spectator-boats.html. Hundreds of boats have already registered to watch.
Besides being an ideal location to see the races, the Brookfield Place plaza will host a free outdoor event village on Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Highlights in the village include five stores selling team gear and sailing accessories, a Moet Champagne bar, a bar from the liquor brand Gosling’s, which is known for its rum, and a booth from the Bermuda Tourism Authority with a lounge area facing the river where the public can relax and watch the races.
