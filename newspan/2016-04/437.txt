BEIJING — When the “Doctor Strange” screenwriter C. Robert Cargill offered an explanation for why Marvel Studios had cast the British actress Tilda Swinton as an important Tibetan character from the original comic book series, he started a new controversy surrounding the film.
In an interview last week on the pop culture show “Double Toasted,” Mr. Cargill had tried to quell a growing uproar from critics accusing Marvel of racism in casting a white actress in a role that they said should have gone to an Asian actor. The trailer, released this month, showed Ms. Swinton playing the Ancient One, who in the comics is a Tibetan mentor to Dr. Stephen Strange, the protagonist.
On “Double Toasted,” Mr. Cargill said that filmmakers had decided to scrub the Ancient One of his Tibetan origins. And that was, he said, largely because they feared any depiction of Tibetans and Tibet could anger the Chinese government and the Chinese people, putting the studio at risk of losing access to the second-biggest film market in the world.
In recent days, commenters on social media have continued to criticize Marvel — some for the casting of Ms. Swinton in what they said should have been a prominent role for an Asian actor and others for what they called the studio’s sycophantic attitude toward the Chinese Communist Party. The anger was especially pronounced among Tibetans opposed to Chinese rule and their supporters.
