The idea was simple but novel: Take one picture of as many women in New York City’s varied comedy scenes as possible.
And so on Saturday afternoon, despite the cold and rain, more than 200 female comedians gathered to have their photo taken together at a performance space in Brooklyn. Amid a festive, buzzing energy, some of the comedians were in formal wear and extravagant makeup, while a few were in full costume (an elderly woman with a walker, a Vine star with painted-on eyeglasses and crab claw hands). The motley looks could have come from the “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” album cover.
Balanced on a stepladder in front of the risers of women, the photographer Mindy Tucker paused to reflect on the moment. “I’ve been in comedy a long time, and this has never happened before,” she said as the room cheered.
In March, she brought her idea for the group photo to Ms. Tucker, who has been documenting the comedy scene in New York since 2008. “She’s very valued in the community, and when she says for people to show up somewhere at a certain time, they do,” Ms. Delfino said.
As female-driven comedies have become increasingly popular in Hollywood, turning Amy Schumer and other women into bankable stars, there’s been a ground-level push to support developing female comics. The actress-director Elizabeth Banks’s new video website, WhoHaHa.com, focuses partly on promoting up-and-coming women, while Fox’s new female-led sketch show, “Party Over Here,” features rising comedians who developed in New York’s sketch and improv scenes.
