Louisa Catherine Adams lived a life that seems made for the telling. Born in London at the dawning of the American Revolution to a father who was American and a mother who was English, she spent her early years in Europe, first with her family, then as the wife of a diplomat who went on to become president, John Quincy Adams. With — and without — her husband, she traveled the world, hobnobbing with royalty, then settled in America, where she toiled to gain him the presidency. Accomplished, ambitious, socially skilled and keenly observant, she was a formidable woman with an extraordinary life, just as the subtitle of this book promises.
Also on this week’s episode, Hope Jahren talks about “Lab Girl”; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Gregory Cowles has best-seller news. Pamela Paul is the host.
