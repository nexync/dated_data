The Supreme Court, facing the prospect of an extended stretch with an eight-member bench, is “working really hard” to reach consensus and avoid deadlocks, Justice Elena Kagan said on Monday.
There are almost 50 cases left to decide before the justices leave for their summer break at the end of June. Justice Kagan said she and her colleagues were committed to issuing decisions in as many of those cases as possible.
But she said Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. had risen to the occasion to lead the court through a difficult period.
Justice Scalia prompted her to take up a new hobby, Justice Kagan said. “I became a hunter because of him,” she said, recalling hunting trips the two had taken together.
Senate Republicans have vowed to keep Justice Scalia’s seat empty through the presidential election. Justice Kagan did not discuss President Obama’s nominee to replace Justice Scalia, Judge Merrick B. Garland, a widely respected and long-serving member of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But she did suggest that someone of his background, credentials and skills would fit in well on the Supreme Court.
“I would put this court as a whole up there with any court that the country has ever had in terms of the kind of legal skills, proficiency and lawyerly aptitude that this court has,” she said.
Justice Kagan, 55, is the youngest and newest member of the court, having been appointed by Mr. Obama in 2010. She had served as United States solicitor general and as dean of Harvard Law School.
Once a nominee is confirmed to replace Justice Scalia, Justice Kagan will be relieved of a task assigned to the junior justice: answering the door when there is a knock during their private conferences.
A member of the court’s staff delivers the missing item and knocks.
