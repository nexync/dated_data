Last month, the stand-up comedian Margaret Cho had a bad set at the Stress Factory in New Jersey. It happens. O.K., it was worse than usual since a clip of Ms. Cho being booed by the crowd showed up on TMZ. But for a comic, bombing is part of the job. What’s less common is getting a second chance with the same audience.
At the club, Mr. Seinfeld will moderate a discussion between the comic and the audience and then perform a stand-up set, followed by one by Ms. Cho. The whole show will be taped for “Comedians in Cars.” The club owner has offered to give the patrons who attended the previous show free tickets.
In the same invitation, Ms. Cho conceded that her original set didn’t go well but made a pitch that this follow-up could be a rare opportunity. “This show is the first time anything like this has happened in this industry,” she wrote, “and I am proud to stand up for this club and give us another chance together.
