In 2009, leaders of the Group of 20 nations, distressed by the global financial crisis, pledged to dismantle the tax havens that have allowed the world’s richest people to avoid paying taxes. The United States and European governments were equally concerned about banks being used by tax cheats and criminals in a shadowy international financial system.
In response, most nations have taken significant steps to make it harder and riskier to hide money overseas. The leaders of 132 nations have agreed to adopt an information-sharing standard developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Of those, 96 are expected to start sharing banking information over the next couple of years through an automated system designed to allow the tax authorities of participating governments to see the overseas holdings of their citizens. But one major international financial hub has refused to sign on — Panama.
In recent years, Panama has tried to shed its status as a tax haven by, for example, negotiating bilateral tax information sharing agreements — including one with the United States. In 2014, it adopted new banking policies designed to make it harder to establish anonymous business entities. Panama had also agreed to adopt the international data sharing standard, but it recently changed that position, saying it was not ready to comply with all the requirements, the O.E.C.D. reported in February. On Wednesday, however, Álvaro Alemán, the Panamanian cabinet chief, said that there were no “irreconcilable differences” with the O.E.C.D., and that the government was ready to find a way to cooperate.
