The nation’s top high school baseball prospect will have a 19-strikeout no-hitter he threw this week erased over a transfer rule. New Jersey’s high school sports governing body said that Jason Groome, a senior left-hander at Barnegat High School, had violated transfer rules after playing at I.M.G. Academy in Bradenton, Fla., last year. A 6-foot-5, 230-pound pitcher, Groome throws a 97-mile-per-hour fastball, along with a curveball and changeup.
