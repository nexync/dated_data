Mark Bradford has been selected to represent the United States at the 2017 Venice Biennale.
Mark Bradford, the highly regarded abstract painter, has been chosen as the United States’ representative to the next Venice Biennale, opening in May 2017. The United States pavilion, with Mr. Bradford’s work, will be organized by Christopher Bedford, director of the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, which was chosen by the Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs to be the commissioning institution for the exhibition.
Mr. Bradford has recently used his influence to help found an arts-based social-services center in the South Los Angeles neighborhood where he grew up. He said in a telephone interview on Monday that he could not yet discuss details of his plans for the pavilion, but that the work would certainly touch on the political and social context in which he, as an African-American artist, has always worked.
Mr. Bedford, who will be the show’s curator along with Katy Siegel, the Rose Art Museum’s curator at large, said in a telephone interview that a “collision of various events” led to his championing of Mr. Bradford for the honor, one of them being the social upheaval in recent years regarding issues like race, gay marriage, immigration and social justice.
