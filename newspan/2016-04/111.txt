They also struggle against stigma, as the “college for all” campaign gets louder, prompting an increased emphasis on standardized testing that takes time away from relevant learning and serves as an inadequate measure of what students know and, by extension, how effective schools are.
We can do better, and we need to if we are going to compete against countries that are pouring funding into first-rate training. We should pay vocational teachers to spend their summers updating their experience in their industry of expertise, and make it easier for people who have worked in industry to become teachers themselves. We should also define high standards for vocational education and attach real apprenticeship opportunities to it.
Finally, we should push our political leaders to make a long-term commitment to technical training for high school and community college students. Of the presidential candidates, John Kasich has been particularly vocal on this issue; some 120,000 high school students are enrolled in some type of vocational program in Ohio.
We can no longer afford to recycle a lukewarm commitment to this kind of training only when economic crises befall us.
