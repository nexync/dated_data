Are liberals impairing our ability to combat climate change?
That may sound like a strange question, particularly to readers of The New York Times. Today conservatives are the ones decidedly blocking any effort by the United States to curb its emissions of greenhouse gases.
And yet even as progressive environmentalists wring their hands at the G.O.P.’s climate change denial, there are biases on the left that stray just as far from the scientific consensus.
Ted Cruz’s argument that climate change is a hoax to justify a government takeover of the world is absurd. But Bernie Sanders’s argument that “toxic waste byproducts of nuclear plants are not worth the risks of the technology’s benefit” might also be damaging.
Highlighting the left’s biases may seem like a pointless effort to apportion equal blame along ideological lines. But it is critical to understand how they have come into being. It suggests how difficult it will be to overcome our scientific and technological taboos.
Joel Mokyr at Northwestern University, an expert on the history of science and technology, notes that the ease with which people accept scientific knowledge depends on how straightforward the proof is.
Einstein’s theory of relativity was readily accepted despite the fact that few people understood it because there were a couple of experimental results no other theory could explain. Natural selection is trickier.
The evolution of scientific knowledge is messy, too. It does not neatly converge on truth along a smooth line, but rather jumps around as new knowledge disproves old certainties. Scientists’ understanding of the speed, intensity and implications of climate change is substantially different from what it was only a couple of decades ago.
But perhaps the most important snag to the diffusion of scientific knowledge is motivation. The average American has little at stake riding on whether the general theory of relativity is right or not. Evolution, by contrast, is a body blow to evangelical Christians’ worldview.
Only 48 percent of respondents agree with the proposition that humans evolved from other beings, according to the General Social Survey, a broad survey of American attitudes and beliefs. But when the question is prefaced with the qualifier “according to the theory of evolution,” agreement with the proposition rises to 72 percent.
Responses aren’t necessarily driven by ignorance. “Where there is a sacred value that empirical science contradicts,” science will have trouble making headway, notes Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
And the value doesn’t even have to be sacred.
A few years back, Dan Kahan of Yale Law School, Hank Jenkins-Smith of the University of Oklahoma and Donald Braman of George Washington University Law School performed experiments testing how values affected people’s agreement with scientists about climate change, the disposal of nuclear waste and allowing concealed possession of handguns.
People identified as more egalitarian and more open to government interventions to address social ills — the left, as it were — were much more likely to say that most scientists agree global warming is happening and that it is caused by human activity. Most also said scientists either disagreed or were divided on the safety of storing nuclear waste.
On the right, people identified as individualistic and wary of Big Government responded differently: In their view, the scientific consensus said the opposite. How could they think that? They manufactured the expert consensus they wanted by defining as experts only those who agreed with their ideological position.
