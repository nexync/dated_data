“A terrible beauty is born,” Yeats wrote in his poem “Easter 1916,” about Ireland’s fight for independence from the British. But the 30 centenarians facing the camera in Alex Fegan’s delightful documentary “Older Than Ireland” are simply beautiful: frail, yes, but wise, wry, flinty, funny and sometimes very tender. All were born before the Easter Rising, an event widely celebrated this year that sparked the explosion in patriotism that ultimately led to the founding of the Irish Republic.
The film begins with a gently frivolous tone, to a light piano score. In largely flat, symmetrical compositions, its subjects address questions: How does it feel to be 100? What’s the secret to longevity? What was school like? (Lots of corporal punishment, apparently.) Then it moves into more haunting recollections: Bessie Nolan, 103, recalls the day of the Easter Rising. Jackie O’Sullivan, 102, met the rebels Michael Collins and Eamon de Valera. Among others, Michael O’Connor, 101, and Flann Brennan, 101, describe the vicious predations of the Black and Tans. Jack Powell, 101, remembers the early emergence of the Irish Republican Army.
It’s often said that the Irish, blessed with the gift of gab, can be splendid raconteurs. You’ll find generous evidence to that effect here. And a bit of poetry as well.
