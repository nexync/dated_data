SAN FRANCISCO — To browse for a pair of brown loafers on Facebook Messenger, you can now text a message to the service to begin a conversation with the mobile shopping start-up Spring. Spring will ask you for a preferred price range for the shoes and show a smattering of what it thinks you might like. If the selection elicits yawns, Spring will try some different options.
Tests of the weather app Poncho on Facebook Messenger led to some light-hearted comments on social media.
Mike Isaac, a reporter for The New York Times, and Shelly Palmer, chief of Palmer Advanced Media, discuss Mark Zuckerberg's keynote at the company's developer conference.
Mr. Tisch of Spring, the mobile shopping start-up that just started offering a bot on Facebook Messenger, said working with the social media company to unveil the chatbot was a no-brainer. Facebook’s huge scale, at more than 1.6 billion global users, makes it a good candidate for kickstarting a new form of commerce online, he said.
