The museum, in consultation with the city of Denver and Mr. Still’s children, has agreed to an unprecedented loan of nine pivotal paintings dating from 1944 to 1958 to the first comprehensive European survey of Abstract Expressionism in 50 years. It opens in September at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and travels to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.
“I couldn’t imagine a review of this movement without Still strongly represented,” said Mr. Sobel, looking to balance the many rules imposed by the artist with advancing his legacy.
