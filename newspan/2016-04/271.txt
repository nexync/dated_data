Mr. Lew also listened to the outspoken leaders of Women on 20s, who were invited to his event last June. Yet it was perhaps never possible that he could satisfy them.
Now both women’s groups are poised to protest.
All of this suggests a public relations disaster ahead for Mr. Lew — and for what was supposed to be a simple, feel-good initiative.
He began last summer thinking he would be simply choosing a woman for the center of the $10 bill, with help from the public through social media, town-hall-style meetings and random encounters. Yet he had problems from the start.
Mr. Lew anticipated that Hamilton’s fans would be upset, so he promised that Hamilton would remain somewhere on the $10. But that provoked women and some men to object on social media that women should not have to share space with any man. Then “Hamilton” opened; neither Mr. Lew nor anyone else could have anticipated its rock-star popularity.
