Regulators released long-awaited rules on Thursday morning that aim to restrict how big financial institutions can pay their top executives.
The new limits on banker bonuses would make the highest-paid employees at the biggest banks wait at least four years to receive parts of their annual pay. If the proposals are completed in the coming months, banks would also have to reclaim bonuses from bankers who take risks that lead to big financial losses.
The regulators are responding to an uproar of criticism over Wall Street’s pay practices after the biggest American banks had to take government bailout money during the 2008 financial crisis. That public anger has been rekindled during the 2016 presidential campaign season, putting pressure on regulators to tighten their oversight of Wall Street.
The new rules on executive pay grew out of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, but it has taken years to put them into practice, even though President Obama has pushed regulators to complete them. The administration is running out of time to get rules approved before a new president is elected.
The structure of executive pay packages before the financial crisis was blamed for encouraging bankers to take unnecessary risks. In some cases, pay was set up in ways that motivated bankers to seek short-term gains even if their actions led to losses over the longer term.
The new rules will force many banks to withhold pay for longer than they have in the past, to ensure that top employees can be held accountable for the longer-term consequences of their risk-taking.
The proposals leave many financial firms, including large asset managers and hedge funds, shielded from the new restrictions because of the way the regulators have defined which institutions are subject to them. Young Wall Street workers, and potential recruits who might once have aspired to jobs in the industry, are already decamping for less regulated corners of finance and corporate America, including Silicon Valley.
For those institutions subject to the rules, the new restrictions are broadly in line with changes that many banks have already been making since the financial crisis.
For instance, it is already an industry standard to wait three years to release stock-based bonuses. The new rules aim to push that to four years.
There has been less consistency in how banks have approached seizing pay from employees if their actions lead to losses. The new proposal makes bankers’ pay vulnerable to so-called clawbacks for seven years after the pay is received, if they are found to have engaged in misconduct or taken actions that led to big losses.
Here are 200 of the highest-paid chief executives in American business.
“This largely codifies the practices that have evolved over the last eight years,” he said.
The regulators were supposed to propose the new rules within 90 days of Dodd-Frank’s passage. Instead, the regulatory agencies delivered a first draft of the rules in 2011, but that draft was widely panned as being too weak.
In the previous draft, the largest banks had to hold back at least 50 percent of all incentive-based pay for three years. Under the new proposals, the same banks will have to withhold 60 percent of that pay for four years.
The new draft also applies the limits to a broader set of “material risk-takers” at big banks, not just top executives.
Marcus Stanley, the policy director at the advocacy organization Americans for Financial Reform, said the new version was stronger than the 2011 proposal, but did not push the banks to go far enough beyond already accepted practices.
He said, for instance, that he had hoped that banks would have to hold back pay for more than four years because big losses on bank investments can often take longer than that to materialize.
In Britain, by contrast, banks are now forced to hold back some pay for at least seven years. European countries have generally imposed stronger restrictions on executive compensation since the financial crisis, including some hard caps on salary and bonuses.
The new American rules would apply only to incentive-based compensation — generally bonuses — which varies according to the performance of the bank and the individual executive.
Even without the rules, banks have faced steady pressure from regulators and shareholders since the financial crisis to change the way they pay their employees and tie more compensation to a firm’s long-term, rather than short-term, success.
JPMorgan Chase, for instance, recently announced that it was altering the pay package of its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, so that he is compensated primarily with stock that he will receive only if the firm achieves certain levels of future profitability. Mr. Dimon will get the stock after five years, which is longer than the new rules propose.
Banks and other financial institutions have generally been cutting pay in recent years because of their lagging performance, and other parts of the Dodd-Frank legislation have limited their ability to take big risks and earn the big profits that were common before the financial crisis.
This week, Goldman Sachs said that the pool of money it had put aside so far this year for employee compensation is 40 percent smaller than it was at the same time last year.
The new rules were debated and described for the first time at a meeting on Thursday of the National Credit Union Administration, the first of the six agencies to take up the proposal.
The public will have until July to comment on the new rules, and it will likely be months after that before they go into effect.
