Jane Monheit approaches a familiar touchstone from an unexpected angle on her new album, “The Songbook Sessions: Ella Fitzgerald.” An act of loving homage from one vocalist to another, it features Ms. Monheit with her longtime band, but in the hands of an outside producer, the trumpeter Nicholas Payton. There’s a flicker of odd-couple tension in their alliance, and it works.
Ms. Monheit, 38, has been touted as an acolyte of Fitzgerald ever since her bright-eyed rise in the late 1990s, though this was always more a matter of sworn influence than of manifest style. Fitzgerald was a jazz singer of unerring instinct and quick composure, crisp and bracing as a classic gin fizz. Ms. Monheit is more like a cosmopolitan with an extra splash of cranberry: ruby-hued, smooth, right on the edge of cloying.
Ms. Monheit can still let pathos get the better of her; it happens on Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn’s “In a Sentimental Mood” (listed on the album as “Chelsea Mood”). But her band — with Michael Kanan on piano; Neal Miner on bass; and Rick Montalbano, her husband, on drums — has a buoyant ease that prevents her from dragging. And Mr. Payton, who has lately been honing his skills as a studio auteur, brings a few fresh ideas to the fore.
Mr. Payton is the likeliest party behind the multitracking of Ms. Monheit’s voice on “Somebody Loves Me,” and the choice to link another Gershwin standard, “I Was Doing All Right,” to the Amy Winehouse tune “Know You Now.” And his vision for “I’ve Got You Under My Skin,” with organ and piano in a braided loop, feels like a remix: Ms. Monheit doesn’t enter until almost two minutes in, sounding eager but unburdened.
