Perhaps you have some in your kitchen now, in a tin or a bottle, the first brick in your construction of this week’s recipe, for chicken paprikash, one of Hungary’s national dishes and a favorite family meal across the Eastern European diaspora in the United States. Throw it out.
Spices lose their flavor over time, but few so quickly as paprika, which starts out tasting of sweet pepper and sunshine but deteriorates in just a few months to sawdust and bitterness. Get some new at the market: sweet or hot Hungarian paprika is best for chicken paprikash, but the generic article isn’t terrible and the smoky Spanish varieties known as pimentón de La Vera would not be out of place, either, lending a deep, woodsy aroma reminiscent of cooking over an open fire. In matters of paprika, freshness trumps provenance every time.
I worship the crisp profundity of chicken skin. So to avoid turning it to rubbery flab, I do not mix it into the sauce when the gravy is complete. Instead, I nestle the legs into the sauce so the skin remains exposed and finish cooking the dish in the oven. Then I remove the meat, add sour cream to the sauce and serve the whole thing with buttered noodles.
Goyische foolishness, Arthur Schwartz declared when I told him about my technique. Schwartz is a cookbook author, restaurant critic and radio personality whose deep roots in the Jewish communities of Brooklyn helped him write the terrific and indispensable “Jewish Home Cooking: Yiddish Recipes Revisited.” It is a song to the joys of paprika, garlic and chicken. Schwartz knows from paprikash.
So you can make chicken paprikash into your own. Add the sour cream or don’t; cook the chicken with skin or without. I use dark meat because I find it more flavorful. You could use breasts instead, or a mixture.
