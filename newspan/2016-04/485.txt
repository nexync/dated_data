Last spring, shortly after her 96th birthday, my mother finally admitted that she was no longer able to make the trip to New York City for Passover. Instead, my partner and I decided we would fly down to Virginia to be with her for the holiday. We would do the shopping, the cooking and the setup. We encouraged her to invite other residents of her senior living complex to celebrate with us.
The night of the first Seder, the line up of walkers stretched far down the hallway. Our company included Hilda, 101; Mona, 98; Ruth, 94; and Shirley, 91. The matzo balls and brisket — “though not the way I used to make them” — received glowing reviews. “This is the best meal I have had in three years,” one of the ladies offered. “Since the day I moved into this place.” Recollections of loved ones and holiday celebrations long past added a bittersweet note to the proceedings.
