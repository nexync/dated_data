Gmail, a pioneer in the grand tradition of elaborate April Fools’ jokes, scrambled to undo its latest one after disgruntled users complained that they had accidentally sent photos of mic-dropping Minions, the little yellow creatures from the movie “Despicable Me,” to their business contacts.
The feature was called the Mic Drop, and it was billed as a way to have the last word in long email chains by sending a GIF of a regal-looking Minion character literally dropping a microphone.
“Simply reply to any email using the new ‘Send + Mic Drop’ button. Everyone will get your message, but that’s the last you’ll ever hear about it. Yes, even if folks try to respond, you won’t see it,” said a Gmail blog post about the feature.
For some, the Mic Drop sounded like the perfect passive-aggressive office behavior. But this is April Fools’ Day, the worst day of the year and a fertile ground for hoaxes, which are so numerous that many news organizations are live-blogging them.
Many unsuspecting Gmail users were simply not in the mood for Minions. Since the Mic Drop button was placed a little too close to the Send button, users lamented their misfiring of the cartoon character when dealing with bosses and co-workers.
Usually, Gmail is beloved for its forays into office humor. In 2007, the service introduced Gmail Paper, which advertised print deliveries of a user’s inbox (“Allow 2-4 business days for a parcel to arrive via post.”) In 2011, there was Gmail Autopilot, which offered to analyze and reply to emails automatically, and even came with a special breakup function. And Gmail itself was launched on April 1, 2004.
