Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Tuesday that it had accepted an offer by Asahi Group Holdings of Japan to buy the beer brands Peroni and Grolsch, as well as certain European operations of SABMiller, for 2.55 billion euros, or about $2.9 billion.
The companies first announced that Asahi had made a binding offer for the brands in February.
It is part of a push by Anheuser-Busch InBev to sell some assets as it seeks to ease regulatory concerns about its over $100 billion merger with SABMiller, which owns the Peroni and Grolsch brands. The combination of SABMiller and Anheuser-Busch would create a beer industry giant that would have annual revenue of about $64 billion and would account for about 30 percent of global beer sales.
In November, Anheuser-Busch agreed to sell SABMiller’s 59 percent stake in MillerCoors in the United States to SABMiller’s joint venture partner Molson Coors Brewing for about $12 billion. That deal includes the global rights to the Miller brand and would make Molson Coors the second-largest brewer in the United States, behind Anheuser-Busch.
In March, China Resources Beer, a state-owned brewer, agreed to buy SABMiller’s 49 percent stake in the maker of Snow, the world’s best-selling beer. The deal would value SABMiller’s stake in CR Snow at about $1.6 billion.
The Molson Coors, Asahi and Snow transactions are contingent on the Anheuser-Busch-SABMiller merger closing.
Last week, Anheuser-Busch also agreed to create a $68 million investment fund, as well as job guarantees and other commitments, to win approval from South African regulators.
For Asahi, the transaction would expand its presence globally and give it a broader distribution network for its domestic brands, namely Asahi Super Dry.
Asahi and its Japanese rivals have moved in recent years to expand beyond their home market as sales have stagnated there.
The offer includes the brands and operations of Royal Dutch Grolsch, Birra Peroni, Miller Brands U.K., the Meantime Brewing Company and SABMiller’s sales and marketing office in France. SABMiller bought Meantime in May 2015.
