As a onetime child actor who has lived much of his life in the public eye, Daniel Radcliffe knows a thing or two about privacy.
And now he has agreed to star in a new Off Broadway play, called “Privacy,” about the implications of technology for personal information.
The play was inspired by revelations about government surveillance described in documents leaked by Edward Snowden, and was written by James Graham, who previously wrote the book for the Broadway musical “Finding Neverland.” Mr. Graham and Josie Rourke, the artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse in London, conducted interviews with British politicians, historians and journalists to incorporate into a production of the play at the Donmar in 2014; they have been conducting similar interviews with American experts as they create a new version for the Public. The play integrates re-enactments of the interviews with some audience participation (patrons are urged to keep their phones on).
The production of “Privacy” at the Public, directed by Ms. Rourke, is the first collaboration between the Donmar, which is one of the most acclaimed theaters in London, and the Public, which holds a similar place in the American theater world.
Mr. Radcliffe, the British actor who began playing Harry Potter at age 11 and continued doing so through eight blockbuster films, will star as a writer loosely modeled on Mr. Graham; performances are scheduled to begin on July 5 and run through Aug. 7. The play will also feature Rachel Dratch (“Saturday Night Live”) as well as Michael Countryman, Reg Rogers, de’Adre Aziza and Raffi Barsoumian.
