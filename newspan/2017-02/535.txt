The chief executive of SoftBank, Masayoshi Son, is an inveterate deal maker. And on Tuesday, the Japanese mogul unveiled his latest: a complex merger to expand his telecommunications empire.
By orchestrating the merger of OneWeb, a satellite operator where Mr. Son has already invested $1 billion, with a debt-laden competitor, Intelsat, the billionaire is hoping to bolster SoftBank’s reach and internet coverage.
But the deal is still contingent on getting Intelsat’s bondholders to effectively take close to a significant haircut on their holdings, to help give the satellite operator some breathing room from its debt load of about $14 billion.
Under the terms of the deal, OneWeb will merge with the publicly traded Intelsat in an all-stock deal. SoftBank will invest $1.7 billion to acquire a 39.9 percent stake in the combined company, at about $5 a share for common stock.
Adding satellites could help SoftBank and its holdings, including Sprint in the United States, improve their high-speed internet capabilities. Mr. Son’s vehicle for his satellite efforts is OneWeb — the latest venture by the entrepreneur Greg Wyler — which has a stated goal of providing lower-cost internet access worldwide within the next decade.
Fusing it with Intelsat, a five-decade-old satellite operator, is meant to help OneWeb expand its services. The two companies contend that together, they would be able to provide more high-speed internet access for homes and businesses, in cars and in other locations.
But crucial to the transaction is the agreement of Intelsat’s bondholders to a debt exchange that, along with the new money from SoftBank, would help reduce the company’s debt by as much as $3.6 billion. The European-based satellite company must convince at least 85 percent of its bondholders to exchange their holdings for new notes.
Intelsat took advice from Guggenheim Securities, Goldman Sachs and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, and Elvinger Hoss Prussen.
OneWeb and SoftBank received advice from PJT Partners and the law firms Morrison & Foerster, Arendt & Medernach and Mourant Ozannes. OneWeb also worked with Barclays and the law firms Choate Hall & Stewart and Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.
