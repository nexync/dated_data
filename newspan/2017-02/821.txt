A Times reporter called it “a members-only club for the tanned and surgically enhanced” set. It’s Mar-a-Lago, the 126-room pink castle on Florida’s Gold Coast that is the winter White House for President Donald J. Trump and his new administration.
The White House correspondent Julie Hirschfeld Davis visited Mar-a-Lago for the first time last weekend.
“The press pool doesn’t actually get to enjoy all of the luxuries of Mar-a-Lago,” it doesn’t stay or eat there, says Ms. Davis. But, she (with other members of the media) was on site when President Trump entertained Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and was at their joint news conference called soon after the President learned that North Korea had fired a missile.
In this podcast, Ms. Davis gives listeners a behind-the-scene sense of how a paper’s White House correspondent does her job (or part of it) on a presidential weekend in Palm Beach — and also tells listeners what it means when the White House “lid” comes on, and off.
Ms. Davis says Mar-a-Lago, with its glittery social scene and endless stream of Bentleys and Rolls Royces, is the world that the president understands best and in which he is most comfortable, but is “diametrically different” from the world of official Washington. She says the weekend visit helped her understand why Donald Trump is a “fish out of water” in D.C.
