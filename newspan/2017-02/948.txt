Because the documentary “Oklahoma City” is an episode of “American Experience,” opening theatrically before airing on PBS on Tuesday, and because it documents events that were widely broadcast on television, much of the movie plays like a tightly edited rundown of familiar material.
But by situating the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in the decades-spanning context of the growth of antigovernment militias in the United States, the movie emphasizes a chilling (if not altogether new) point: that Timothy McVeigh, who was executed in 2001 for the bombing, did not emerge from a vacuum.
The documentary never loses sight of the 168 who died in the bombing. The director, Barak Goodman, includes interviews with an impressive array of witnesses and first-responders: a surgeon, the police, employees at the Murrah building’s Social Security Administration and Housing and Urban Development offices. A mother remembers envisioning digging for her son in the rubble.
“Oklahoma City” suggests that conspiracy theories today have consequences for tomorrow — a message with terrifying implications in an age of fake news.
