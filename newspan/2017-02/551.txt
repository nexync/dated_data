At Sugarfish’s Southern California locations, the chef Kazunori Nozawa’s omakase tasting is called “trust me.” The restaurants also sell boxes of “trust me” assortments to go, and these popular items will be available beginning on March 20 at the New York outpost, which opened in November. There are several set menu choices, $30 to $46, along with à la carte options. If you dig in soon after picking it up, you will find that the fish wraps the restaurant’s signature warm rice. “If the rice didn’t hold up to Nozawa standards, we wouldn’t do takeout,” said Kevin Bergschneider, the director of operations.
