KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — For years, North Korea has rattled the world with its nuclear tests and its threats to visit a nuclear holocaust upon the United States. Now, the finding by the Malaysian police that Kim Jong-nam was assassinated with VX nerve agent is a stark reminder of the North’s lesser-known weapons of mass destruction: a stockpile of chemical and biological weapons.
Mr. Kim, the estranged elder brother of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, was killed on Feb. 13 when two women rubbed his face with the nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, the police said on Friday.
If North Korean citizens were behind the killing, as Malaysian officials suggest, the use of VX raises several questions: Was the North Korean government using the attack to signal to the world its fearsome arsenal of such dangerous weapons? Or was the toxin simply an attempt to avoid detection in carrying out a brazen killing at one of the world’s busiest airports?
North Korea’s nuclear program has long been the most urgent concern of the United States and its allies, and the now-dormant six-party talks to curb the program did not address chemical and biological weapons.
“The reported use of VX reminds us that not only is the North’s nuclear-missile threat serious but so are its asymmetric threats, including biochemical weapons and cyber that are all part of the regime’s W.M.D. tool kit,” said Duyeon Kim, a Seoul-based nonresident fellow at Georgetown University’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.
South Korea’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday expressing “shock” at the use of a chemical weapon and vowed to work with the international society to deal “strongly” with the violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
The deadly use of a chemical weapon banned by international conventions in such a public manner could strengthen calls for the United States to put North Korea back on a list of terrorism-sponsoring countries, analysts said.
The North was first put on the terrorist list after its bombing of a South Korean airliner near Myanmar in 1987, killing all 115 people onboard. But the United States delisted the country in 2008 as part of an agreement aimed at ending North Korea’s nuclear programs — a deal that has since disintegrated with the North’s subsequent missile and nuclear weapons tests.
After his announcement that Mr. Kim had been killed by VX nerve agent, Khalid Abu Bakar, the inspector general of the Malaysian police, said on Friday that small amounts of the poison could have been brought into the country without being discovered.
“If the amount of the chemical brought in was small, it would be difficult for us to detect,” Mr. Khalid told reporters.
The airport terminal, which handles more than two million passengers a month, will be decontaminated despite the passage of time since the killing, he said.
Two women have been arrested in the killing, one from Indonesia and the other from Vietnam. Their defenders say they were duped into carrying out the attack and thought it was a prank, but Mr. Khalid said they had trained for it and practiced at two major shopping malls. The women used their bare hands to apply the poison on Mr. Kim’s face and washed them immediately afterward, he said.
One drop of VX, or about 10 milligrams, can be fatal. But the attackers could have used a safety-enhancing battlefield form of the agent. Known as VX2, it is divided into two compounds that are harmless individually but become lethal when mixed together.
Each component also could have been made in slow-release form, as is done with many drugs.
If Mr. Kim’s two assassins had each applied one component of VX, this would explain why two people were needed, how they survived the attack, and perhaps why it took 15 minutes or more for Mr. Kim to die.
“Use of a binary nerve agent lends itself to this method and allows for a potentially highly targeted hit,” said Vipin Narang, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has two degrees in chemical engineering.
The woman who applied the second compound would have risked exposing herself to the first component, which could explain why, as Mr. Khalid said on Friday, one of the women became ill and began vomiting after the attack.
This scenario raises the possibility that Mr. Kim could have saved his own life by immediately washing his face rather than going to airport staff members, as he did, to report the attack.
Professor Narang said it was clear that North Korea wanted the West to know what it is capable of — but without causing mass casualties.
In 2014, the South Korean Defense Ministry said the North had stockpiled 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and had a capacity to produce a variety of biological weapons.
Kim Jong-un has a history of resorting to extreme measures against his enemies.
Since taking power after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il, in 2011, he has executed at least 140 senior officials, sometimes killing them with antiaircraft machine guns and even incinerating some of their bodies with flamethrowers, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank affiliated with South Korea’s National Intelligence Service. Such measures were designed as a warning to others, South Korean officials said.
Lee Byong-chul, a nonproliferation expert at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation in Seoul, said the use of VX nerve agent highlights the proliferation threat posed by North Korea, noting that it has been accused of providing chemical weapons technology to Syria since the 1990s.
Shipments of gas masks, gas detectors and other protective gear bound for Syria from North Korea were intercepted in 2009 and 2013.
If confirmed, Mr. Lee said, the use of VX nerve agent by North Korea will very likely weaken the Trump administration’s appetite for reopening nuclear disarmament talks, especially after its recent test of what it called a new type of intermediate-range ballistic missile.
Steve Vickers, a security consultant based in Hong Kong, said that Mr. Kim’s assassination would be seen as a further insult to China, which had protected him for years by allowing him to live in the Chinese territory of Macau.
“This is clearly an embarrassment for the Chinese state security and to a lesser extent to the Malaysian government,” Mr. Vickers said.
