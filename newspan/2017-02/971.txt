The title character of “Rock Dog” isn’t likely to end up on anyone’s Top 5 list of animated heroes, but the film does have a thoroughly enjoyable rocker in it. And an appealingly nasty wolf, too.
Bodi (the voice of Luke Wilson) is a mastiff who — as all young animated characters must — chafes at his assigned role in life, which is to guard the sheep on Snow Mountain. Blame radio. He has accidentally come into possession of one, and the music he hears on it makes him long to try the rock ’n’ roll life.
He’s especially enamored of Angus Scattergood, a legendary rocker whose voice is provided by Eddie Izzard in a delightful performance. Bodi leaves Snow Mountain and largely by accident makes his way to Angus’s mansion, whose excessive security features are a comic high point of the film.
