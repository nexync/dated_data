First, Emil Ferris Was Paralyzed. Then Her Book Got Lost at Sea.
Like many of the best monster stories, Emil Ferris’s true-life horror tale starts with a bite. But more about that in a moment.
First, a word concerning Ms. Ferris’s blood-tingling debut graphic novel, “My Favorite Thing Is Monsters,” which oozes with the secrets and hungers that shadow childhood. Set in turbulent, late 1960s Chicago, it braids vintage monster imagery with the preternatural curiosity of a 10-year-old named Karen Reyes, who fancies herself a wolf girl.
“Monsters,” from Fantagraphics, takes the form of a sketchbook diary as Karen tries to solve the murder of her stunning yet mysterious upstairs neighbor, Anka. Ms. Ferris’s ferocious Expressionistic art, with its Crumb-like crosshatching, nails the grit-in-your-mouth feel of her home city.
There are still days when Ms. Ferris needs to hole up. “When I’m too worn out or in pain I lie in bed and write in my mind,” she said in an email.
Her dreams often pick up the slack, and they helped her create one of the book’s grisly delights. “Monsters” is sprinkled with covers of terror mags that never were: Ghastly, Gory Stories, Ghoulish and more, inspired by movie posters and classic 1950s EC comics like Tales From the Crypt and The Vault of Horror.
Those who conjure sweetness for her include Otto Dix, George Grosz and Aubrey Beardsley. Among cartoonists she cites R. Crumb, Alison Bechdel and Mr. Spiegelman.
And then, after West Nile and all those years of hard, anonymous work, Ms. Ferris’s book was lost at sea. Really.
“Monsters” was originally scheduled to come out in October. But the cargo ship carrying the 10,000-book print run from South Korea to the United States was seized at the Panama Canal because the vessel’s owner was deep in debt.
