Trimming your income taxes is an exercise in financial fitness. You are aiming for a low number. As in golf, that’s a goal that can be achieved honorably with skill and practice.
This sample return, prepared in consultation with Bob Meighan, a vice president of TurboTax, the tax software published by Intuit, guides you through the process. Understanding how it works can help, whether you rely on a professional preparer do your own return by hand or use software, as we did here.
The return is for a hypothetical suburban New York couple, Samuel and Felicity. Their combined taxable income of $89,985 (Line 43) puts them in the 25 percent federal tax bracket. Thanks to various breaks and deductions, their bottom line is far less than their total income of $190,700 (Line 22).
All taxpayers get the benefit of lower brackets on part of their taxable income. For married couples filing jointly, the 25 percent bracket applies to taxable income above $75,300 and up to $151,900, and taxable income is calculated after various breaks are taken.
They have three dependents: their children, Cyril and Heidi, and an elderly parent, Sydney, who lives with them, so they claimed five personal exemptions. Itemized deductions and education credits also helped to reduce their taxable income taxes.
Form 1040 first asks a taxpayer to list all income. Then it factors in adjustments, deductions and personal exemptions to determine how much income is taxable. Most of the numbers are transferred from worksheets or supplemental forms and schedules. Taxable income and the tax on it are calculated on Page 2, as are credits — which are more valuable than deductions, because they reduce taxes dollar for dollar.
In this return, self-employment tax (Line 57), which covers what Samuel must pay for Social Security and Medicare, is added to income taxes for the total tax calculations. The last number on Page 2 shows either a refund or payment due.
The Internal Revenue Service encourages taxpayers to file electronically. However, people who prepare their own returns may mail in paper forms. Either way, the preparation is the same.
First, gather papers related to income and deductions, including the official forms: W-2, 1099, 1098, K-1 and others sent by employers, banks, brokerage firms and anyone else who paid you. Payers must also send copies to the I.R.S. The agency’s computers compare returns with what the payers report. If you are missing a W-2 or a 1099; go to the source for a new copy.
Like most married couples, Samuel and Felicity are filing jointly (Line 2). Their five exemptions are on Line 6. Felicity, a designer, has a salary of $103,500 that is reduced by a $10,000 contribution she made to her 401(k) retirement plan. Her net salary of $93,500 is reported on Box 1 of her W-2 and on Line 7 of the 1040. The 401(k) contribution appears on her W-2, but not on their tax return. Samuel is a self-employed consulting engineer. His net income, $91,561 after office rent and other expenses, is transferred from Schedule C to Line 12.
Taxable interest income of $613 is reported on Line 8a. Their ordinary dividends of $923, reported on Form 1099-DIV issued by financial institutions, are shown on Line 9a. Like most dividends from domestic stocks and stock-based mutual funds, all are deemed “qualified” and appear on Line 9b. They are taxed like long-term capital gains — at 15 percent for most people and 20 percent for those in the 39.6 percent income-tax bracket. People in the 10 percent and 15 percent brackets do not pay taxes on qualified dividends or capital gains but should report them.
This couple did not have to file Schedule B because they did not earn more than $1,500 in either interest or dividends.
Capital gains of $4,103 (Line 13) come from Schedule D, Line 16. Their total income is $190,700 (Line 22).
Next come two adjustments, often called above-the-line deductions. Samuel can deduct half his self-employment tax, which is for Social Security and Medicare, $6,469 (Line 27). Employers pay one-half of those taxes for employees and can deduct their share, so self-employed people, who pay the entire tax, deduct half. On Line 28 is $17,018 for Samuel’s tax-deferred self-employed pension plan. That is the maximum contribution he can make, as calculated by TurboTax. Employed people who do sideline consulting or freelance work may take similar deductions, or adjustments, if they have contributed to a self-employment pension plan.
The couple’s adjusted gross income of $167,213 is on Line 37. That important number affects many others and may limit some deductions and credits. It is often the starting point for your state income tax return.
After itemized deductions of $56,978 (Line 40, from Schedule A) and five personal exemptions worth $20,250 (Line 42), the couple’s taxable income is $89,985 (Line 43). The regular tax on that is $13,540 (Line 44). The alternative minimum tax (A.M.T.), which denies personal exemptions and breaks like the deduction for state and local taxes was lower than the regular tax for this couple. Line 45 is blank on this return: They weren’t liable for the A.M.T.
Next are credits, which reduce taxes dollar for dollar. The Taxpayers claim credits of $959 (Line 50) and $639 (Line 68 from Schedule 8863 for Cyril’s college costs.
Self-employment tax of $12,937 (Line 57) comes from Schedule SE. Taxes of $14,000 were withheld from Felicity’s salary (Line 64). Because Samuel is self-employed, his earnings were not subject to withholding and no taxes were withheld on their investment income, so they paid quarterly estimated taxes of $10,000 (Line 65). The bottom line (78) is that they owe $879. They get no refund but they are pleased: Because they calculated carefully they did not give the Treasury an interest-free loan. Nor did they incur a penalty for failing to pay a sufficient amount of tax during the year.
Unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 10 percent of adjusted gross income can be deducted. The Taxpayers cannot deduct all their expenses ($42,157 on Line 1) but do qualify for a deduction of $25,426 (Line 4), mainly because they pay premiums for Sydney’s Medicare supplement insurance and for treatments not covered by Medicare or his Medigap policy.
The couple can deduct state income taxes of $5,172 (Line 5) and real estate taxes of $13,000 (Line 6), as well as home mortgage interest of $9,500 (Line 10).
They also can deduct gifts to charity of $3,880 (Line 19), which include $3,640 in cash (Line 16) and $240 (Line 17) for the thrift-shop value of clothing donated to a church rummage sale. If audited, filers must be able to show written evidence, like bank records, for cash donations and receipts issued by the charity for gifts valued at $250 or more.
Casualty and theft losses (Line 20) can be deducted when losses not recouped through insurance reimbursements or other payments exceed $100 per incident plus 10 percent of adjusted gross income. Relatively few people qualify, but those who do file Form 4684 (not shown) with their returns.
Because miscellaneous itemized deductions like union or professional dues, unreimbursed employee business expenses and tax preparation fees (Line 27) are allowed only for expenses that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income, they couldn’t take any.
Itemized deductions total $56,978 (Line 29), which is well above the standard deduction of $12,600 for married couples filing jointly, so for this couple it pays to itemize.
As an unincorporated engineering consultant, Samuel must file Schedule C for a sole proprietorship.
He had gross income of $131,250 (Line 7), and expenses of $39,689 (Line 28) and deducted $4,398 (Line 9) for driving his car 8,145 miles for business. For 2016, business mileage is deductible at 54 cents a mile. The largest expense, detailed in Part II, was $12,000 for office rent (Line 20b). Having bought office furniture and equipment in recent years, Samuel did not purchase anything last year that qualifies for an immediate write-off known as a Section 179 deduction, as opposed to depreciating the equipment over several years (Line 13).
Returns containing Schedule C have above-average audit rates, and filers who are audited must substantiate deductions, so detailed records are important. Samuel reported net earnings of $91,561 (Line 31).
Asset sales that resulted in a net capital gain or loss are reported on Schedule D, which takes numbers from Form 8949.
Last summer, the couple, feeling anxious about the presidential campaign, and seeing the value of their stocks in Twitter and Goldman Sachs losing value, sold those shares. They lost $3,279.50 on Goldman (Part 1I of Schedule 8949) and $5,868 on Twitter (Part II of 8949). Losses of up to $3,000 can be used to offset ordinary income; any more may be carried forward to future years.
But in the autumn they decided to take gains of $1,400 on Exxon Mobil and $9,750 on Amazon, which left them with a net gain. They also had a mutual fund capital gain distribution of $2,100 (Schedule D, Line 13), which brought their net long-term gain to $7,382 (Line 15). Combined with their short-term loss of $3,279 (Line 7 of Schedule D), they had a net gain of $4,103 (Line 16 of Schedule D), which is carried forward to Line 13 of Form 1040.
Schedule D is also used to report sales of real estate, artwork and other assets, including municipal bonds. (Only the interest on these bonds, not any profit on sales, is tax-exempt.) The Taxpayers did not have any of these sales to report.
The costs for the sales reported include brokerage fees and charges, and the sale price is calculated after deducting such fees. Assets held for a year or less are short term, and their sales are reported in Part I. Short-term gains are taxed like ordinary income. Long-term gains are taxed at lower rates than ordinary income, and are tax-free for those in the 10 and 15 percent brackets.
Farmers (Line 1a) and independent contractors or consultants pay self-employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare. Samuel’s net profit of $91,561, as reported on Schedule C, is entered on Lines 2 and 3 of Schedule SE, and multiplied by 92.35 percent to determine his taxable earnings base, $84,557, on Line 4. In turn, that number is multiplied by 15.3 percent, which is the sum of 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. The result, $12,937 on Line 5, is Samuel’s self-employment tax.
The calculation is slightly different for people whose earnings base exceeds $118,500, because Social Security taxes end there, but Medicare taxes apply to all earned income. They must multiply the amount on Line 4 by 2.9 percent, add it to $14,694, and enter the result on Line 5. In either case, half the amount on Line 5 — $6,469, for Samuel — is entered on Line 6, then carried over to Line 27 of Form 1040 to be deducted from income.
Two credits for education, the American Opportunity Credit, which may be claimed for four years of undergraduate education, provided the student is enrolled at least half time, and the Lifetime Learning Credit, may be claimed on this form.
The income limit for claiming the full American Opportunity Credit is a modified adjusted gross income of $80,000 for single filers, but those with incomes up to $90,000 can claim a reduced credit. The range is $160,000 to $180,000 for married couples filing jointly.
The Taxpayers, whose modified adjusted gross income fell within the range, were able to claim a $1,598 credit (Line 7) for Cyril, a college student. On Page 1 of the form, that amount is separated into a refundable credit of $639 (Line 8) and a nonrefundable credit of $959 (Line 9). Refundable credits allow eligible taxpayers whose taxes are below the amount of the credit to claim a refund for the difference.
The tax code has other breaks for educational costs, which tax software may identify for users who answer its questionnaire.
