For his bookshop and website One Grand Books, the editor Aaron Hicklin asked people to name the 10 books they’d take with them if they were marooned on a desert island. The next in the series is the actress Isabelle Huppert, who is nominated for an Academy Award for her role in “Elle.” She shares her list exclusively with T.
I always read this book again just to experience the delight of my first reading. I fell madly in love with everything in that book, the two main characters, Mary and Moses, and Africa not only described but conveyed through the writing. A true writer makes a continent come to life. I met Doris Lessing once in London while I was performing, in English, a Friedrich Schiller play.
All of Japan is in this book. A true marvel. Set at the Emperor’s court during the 10th century, a woman takes notes and becomes our contemporary. I could have performed that woman. I feel very close to Mizoguchi and Ozu’s actresses.
Maybe the greatest novel ever written, but I haven’t read them all! It’s all of humankind head-on by Dostoyevsky. A mix of sadism and humor. In Poland I shot a movie by Andrzej Wajda based on this great book.
Regarding books I have not yet read: The “Snopes” trilogy. I know Faulkner created some of the most beautiful female characters. I can’t wait to discover Linda Snopes!
Friends of mine tell me it’s an essential book. I’m taking it with me to the island! I know it takes place in Venice among other places.
The poet. He is almost the inventor of our current sensibility. Never naïve, sometimes evil, always brilliant. I am lucky to be able to read him in French.
I bet there aren’t any movie theaters on the desert island, so I will bring books that remind me of cinema. I will try to secretly fill a whole luggage. Some interviews collections: Hitchcock-Truffaut, Orson Welles, Ava Gardner… Officially here is one, with the sublime Billy Wilder.
Yes! Shakespeare! Always! The greatest! All Shakespeare! Of course!
