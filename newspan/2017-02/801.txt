The inability of the White House and Congress to address real national priorities is symptomatic of a seriously bewildered and inept administration. It is no wonder, then, that we can expect instead a showcase assault on dangerous entities like the National Endowment for the Arts, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the National Endowment for the Humanities, AmeriCorps and SeniorCorps â€” all in the name of reducing the national debt.
If this meanspirited dumbing-down succeeds, ostensibly to help America be great again, it will be a triumph of technique over purpose.
