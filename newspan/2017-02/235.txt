After the election in November, we should have known better than to assume that a sure thing was a sure thing.
Once again, at the Academy Awards, a long night produced a shocking upset and unforgettable television. After “La La Land” was announced as the winner of the long-expected best picture award and its team was in the middle of acceptance speeches, a commotion broke out onstage.
“La La Land” had not won after all. Because of a mix-up — one of the presenters, Warren Beatty, blamed having the wrong results card — it turned out that the underdog “Moonlight” had not only pulled out a stunning upset but, for once, made it truly worth sitting to the end of a long, long awards show.
It was indeed just a year ago that the controversy hanging over the Oscars was #OscarsSoWhite, when no minority actors received nominations. This year, with a more diverse field of nominees — and controversy over race and xenophobia hanging over the entire country — the film industry was ready to turn its flagellation outward.
The Oscars 2017: It’s not us — it’s him!
There have been years in the past that the Oscars have been an uneasy blend of celebration and seriousness. This year, they were also a reminder that there are few escapes from politics in public life right now.
But given the awards’ exclusionary history, maybe the strongest rejoinders to the political arguments of the day — over whom to let into the country, and to whom the culture belongs — were the winners.
The Oscars being a vast show, though, there was plenty of time for material that wasn’t topical. Mr. Kimmel brought a tour-bus group into the theater in a bit that felt endless. But it was a way to bring regular people to the party.
On a night that Hollywood was collecting its hardware and feeling its voice, these moments reminded us that none of it would happen without the people who buy the tickets and live the stories.
