I was impressed and pleased to learn of the disposition handed down to the five teenagers who vandalized a historic black schoolhouse in Virginia. The assignment is to read a series of books about peoples and cultures different from theirs.
They are also to write a report on the books read, and a paper about the effect that swastikas and “white power” messages have on African-Americans and the broader community. At least one of the boys did not know what a swastika meant.
The entire country would benefit by reading these and other books. Let’s start a monthly read across the country with online and in-person discussions. Maybe we could all learn to walk in others’ footsteps.
