Vladimir Urin, the general director of the Bolshoi Theater since 2013, will remain in his position for an unspecified further term, according to the Russian news agency RIA Novosti. The announcement came after a meeting between Mr. Urin and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which was reported on Mr. Putin’s website on Friday.
Mr. Urin, who played a key role in steering the Bolshoi after the shock of the January 2013 acid attack on the ballet director Sergei Filin, is known as a tough, experienced administrator. He is thought to support the establishment of a new committee — set up by Mr. Putin’s culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, who arranged the presidential meeting with Mr. Urin — to rule on issues of creative conflict and job appointments within Russian theaters. Some commentators have described the move as a means of imposing censorship on artistic choices.
In the conversation reported on Mr. Putin’s website, Mr. Urin details the Bolshoi’s current performance and touring schedule, the earnings of the Bolshoi Ballet dancers and opera singers, and the rise in ticket revenues from 1.4 billion rubles (about $24 million) in 2014 to 2.2 billion rubles (about $37.9 million) in 2016.
“Not bad,” Mr. Putin said about the revenue, according to the transcript. Mr. Urin also outlined plans for collaborations with the Paris Opera, La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera, saying that he has reached an agreement with the Met’s general manager, Peter Gelb, to co-produce three works, two of which will have their premieres in Moscow.
