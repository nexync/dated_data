Many years ago, while visiting my brother in New York in the dead of winter, I ran to a store to buy a pair of gloves. I promptly lost one of them the next day somewhere on Sixth Avenue. For 20 years, it has been a running joke with my wife that when I see a single glove on the street, my reaction is to pick it up to see whether it is mine. It drives her crazy.
We continued on and at Second Avenue, I saw a young man walking briskly wearing one glove with a neon-green band.
“I am,” he replied, appearing a little stunned.
Relieved and most grateful, he thanked me profusely.
I know how he felt and am not giving up hope.
