A new week did not stem the flow of Uber’s bad news.
Last week brought a rush of embarrassments for the ride-hailing service, including claims of sexual harassment from a former employee; a lawsuit from Waymo, a self-driving car rival that is owned by Google’s parent company; and questions over Uber’s ethics. The new revelations have prompted us to wonder when the next shoe might drop for the company.
On Monday, the technology news website Recode reported that a top engineering executive at Uber, Amit Singhal, had left the company after failing to disclose that he had faced sexual harassment allegations at his former employer, Google. Mr. Singhal had joined Uber only weeks ago.
The disclosures were another inopportune news event for Uber, write Mike Isaac and Daisuke Wakabayashi, tech reporters for The New York Times. The only upside may be that removing Mr. Singhal so swiftly would help Uber sidestep further controversy down the line.
There was other Uber news on Monday as well, much of it negative.
The Verge reported that Uber had ignored repeated warnings from California regulators about whether a self-driving car experiment it started in San Francisco last year was legal. Despite not having the proper permits, Uber embarked on the self-driving vehicles test — and the pilot program was shut down a week later. According to The Verge, which obtained emails between Uber and California’s Department of Motor Vehicles through a public records request, the episode could have been entirely avoided had Uber heeded the warnings of the D.M.V. in the first place.
