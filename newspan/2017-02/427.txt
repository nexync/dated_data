Middle East|Iran Treads Cautiously With Trump. So Far.
Iranian Hard-liners have been critical of President Hassan Rouhani. With President Trump in power, some dismiss him as a figure of the past, the right answer in the Obama era but the wrong one now.
TEHRAN — Until President Trump’s inauguration, Iran’s clerics felt comfortable leading worshipers in a chorus of “Death to America” while simultaneously signing a $16.6 billion deal with Boeing. Now, the establishment is treading carefully, with even most hard-liners concerned that the smallest provocation could lead to military conflict.
But some question how long their caution will last in the face of a Trump administration that has brought a new level of hostility and confrontation to a relationship that under President Barack Obama was stable, if brittle.
Other Iranian officials have also responded mildly to the Trump administration.
After Mr. Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order barring citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, the Iranian government expressed anger. But so far it has reciprocated only by banning a visit by American wrestlers.
“The Trump administration condemns actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout the Middle East and place American lives at risk,” Mr. Flynn said on Wednesday.
Mr. Flynn did not elaborate on what he meant by saying Iran was on notice. But in Iran, many agreed that whatever it meant, it did not bode well.
