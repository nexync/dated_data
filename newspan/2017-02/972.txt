Talk about sensitive subjects.
It turns out that people take their pizza very personally. So when the president of Iceland casually joked last week that pizza topped with pineapple should be outlawed, he set off a debate of international (and viral) proportions.
The incendiary remarks by this particular world leader, Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson, were made during a visit to a high school in northern Iceland, according to news reports.
The story quickly ranked among the top trending stories on Reddit and was picked up by news sites including the Guardian, CNN, USA Today and even Foreign Policy. Fans of the topping were outraged. Pizza purists thought they had found a champion.
The seafood suggestion did not help matters.
While shellfish may not have been such a controversial selection — see Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana’s legendary white clam pie in New Haven — the president used the word “fiskmeti” in the Icelandic-language version of his post, which translates as fish-products, rather than seafood.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, pineapple-topped pizza did not originate in Hawaii, but in Canada in 1962, when restaurateur Sam Panopoulos decided to mix ham with canned pineapple on his pie to see how it would turn out, according to Atlas Obscura.
“People said ‘You are crazy to do this,’ ” Mr. Panopoulos told the website in a 2015 profile.
The topping has since become a longstanding source of contention, with its own Know Your Meme subject page and a 2014 worst topping ranking by the website Thrillist.
