MANDALAY, Myanmar — The police in Myanmar announced on Wednesday that they had arrested four people in the killing of a prominent Muslim human rights lawyer who was an adviser to the country’s leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi — a death that raised new concerns about Myanmar’s rocky transition to democracy.
The lawyer, U Ko Ni, was shot in the head leaving Yangon International Airport on Sunday while holding his grandchild. The brazen killing comes as Myanmar struggles to emerge from decades of military dictatorship and grapples with sectarian violence between Buddhists and Muslims.
The police said they had arrested U Myint Swe, whom they accuse of masterminding the killing, near the Thai border. U Kyi Lin, who is accused of being the gunman, was arrested shortly after the shooting. They did not identify the other two in custody.
Mr. Ko Ni, a member of the governing National League for Democracy, was killed as he returned from Indonesia with other government officials and civic leaders to discuss democracy and conflict resolution.
Myanmar has been confronted by rising sectarian violence between the majority Buddhist population and minority Muslims, with Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, facing criticism for not taking stronger action to stop attacks against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority, in Rakhine State.
The funeral on Monday for Mr. Ko Ni, 65, who was involved in the interfaith peace movement, drew thousands of mourners, though Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi did not attend.
While Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party won a strong victory in democratic elections in 2015, the military still holds considerable power and has been accused of carrying out a brutal counterinsurgency campaign against the Rohingya. The crackdown has helped drive a refugee crisis among the Rohingya, with many fleeing across the border to Bangladesh.
