The Atlanta rapper Future has reached No. 1 on the Billboard album chart for a fourth time this week, and next week may make chart history with a fifth album.
Future’s self-titled album, released by Epic on Feb. 17, went straight to No. 1 with 109 million streams and 60,000 sales in its first week, according to data from Nielsen. In the new “multi-metric consumption” formula used by Nielsen and Billboard to reconcile the various ways that listeners now access music, “Future” had the equivalent of 140,000 full album sales. It is Future’s fourth time at No. 1, after “DS2,” “Evol” and “What a Time to Be Alive,” a collaboration with Drake.
Also this week, Bruno Mars’s “24K Magic” (Atlantic) is No. 2, and the soundtrack to “Fifty Shades Darker” (Universal Studios/Republic), last week’s No. 1, falls two spots to third place. The Weeknd’s “Starboy” (XO/Republic) is No. 4 and Migos’s “Culture” (Quality Control/300) is No. 5.
