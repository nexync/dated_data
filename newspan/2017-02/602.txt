SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — Hideki Matsuyama won the Phoenix Open on the fourth hole of a playoff for the second straight year, outlasting Webb Simpson at TPC Scottsdale on Sunday.
Matsuyama, 24, won with a 10-foot birdie putt on the short par-4 17th hole, the same spot where he finished off Rickie Fowler a year ago.
Matsuyama closed with a five-under-par 66, parring the final three holes to match Simpson at 17 under par, 267. Matsuyama’s 20-foot birdie try to win in regulation on the par-4 18th hole stopped just short.
The tournament drew an estimated 58,654 fans Sunday, shattering the weekly record with 655,434. The previous mark, 618,365, was set last year. A record 204,906 packed the grounds Saturday.
Matsuyama took advantage of a collapse on the back nine by Byeong Hun An, who led after three rounds. Three strokes ahead of Matsuyama at the turn, An made bogeys on the first two holes on the back nine and closed with two more. He had a 73 to finish sixth at 14 under.
Matsuyama won his second PGA Tour title of the season and his fourth over all. He has won five worldwide events in the last three and a half months.
Matsuyama became the sixth player to successfully defend his title at this event and the first to do it at TPC Scottsdale. The other five are the Hall of Famers Ben Hogan, 1946-47; Jimmy Demaret, 1949-50; Lloyd Mangrum, 1952-53; Arnold Palmer, who won three in a row, 1961-63; and Johnny Miller, 1974-75. Matsuyama also became the first player to win the same event in a playoff two straight years since Ernie Els won the Sony Open in Hawaii in 2003-4.
Matsuyama and Simpson, the 2012 United States Open champion, matched pars on the first three extra holes, playing the par-4 18th twice and the par-4 10th before heading to the 332-yard 17th hole.
Simpson’s drive ended up on the right edge of the green, with a bunker blocking his path. Instead of trying to hit a wedge over the bunker, he putted and left himself a 25-footer that lipped the cup.
Louis Oosthuizen shot a 65 to finish a stroke back. He birdied Nos. 14, 15 and 17, then hit in the right bunker on 18 and scrambled to save par.
Fowler also shot a 65 to match J. J. Spaun (67) at 15 under.
Phil Mickelson tied for 16th at 10 under after a 71. He made a run with four birdies on the front nine, then played the back nine in four over with a double bogey, four bogeys and two birdies. Mickelson, 46, played his 100th round in the event, which he won in 1996, 2005 and 2013.
Jon Rahm, who had his first PGA Tour victory last week, had a 70 to also finish at 10 under.
