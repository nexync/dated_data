• Justices, get ready.
The Trump administration appears likely to file an emergency application to the Supreme Court in a day or two, after a federal appeals panel rejected a bid to reinstate the order barring travelers to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim nations.
The Supreme Court remains short-handed and could deadlock: A 4-to-4 tie would leave the lower court’s ruling in place. A decision could come as soon as next week, either to reinstate the ban or to continue to block it.
• The cabinet gets another new face.
Tom Price will lead President Trump’s efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, after the Senate confirmed him as health and human services secretary.
Mr. Price is the first doctor to lead the department since Dr. Louis W. Sullivan stepped down at the end of the first Bush administration in January 1993.
• An easing of tensions.
Relations between the U.S. and China could thaw somewhat after Mr. Trump agreed in a telephone call with President Xi Jinping to honor the “One China” policy.
Mr. Trump welcomes Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, today for a three-day visit. The president is expected to express his commitment to the countries’ mutual defense treaty.
• The tail end of the tempest.
The severe storm that brought up to 18 inches of snow and knocked out power to thousands of homes in the U.S. Northeast seems to be letting up.
The job of digging out can begin in earnest today.
• A battle zone teeters.
Months after the recapture of Falluja showed that Iraq could regain one of the Islamic State’s strongholds, the victory now seems at risk.
There is no sign yet that the Shiite-led national government can secure and rebuild the Sunni city, and Iraqi and American security officials fear that neglected residents may once again embrace the Islamic State.
The scene is more encouraging in parts of Mosul that have been retaken by Iraqi forces, our reporter observed this week.

But under the tax overhaul that House Republicans are pushing, or under similar proposals that Mr. Trump has offered, the guarantee looks impossible to fulfill.

Investors remain skittish about the currency’s long-term future, despite moves by the European Central Bank and signs of growth across the Continent.
• The recent transfer of 300 tons of gold to Frankfurt from New York is part of a wider effort by the German central bank to store reserves at home.
The country historically kept gold overseas, fearing a Soviet invasion.

• Recipe of the day: End the week by tackling our “ultimate” veggie burger.
We’re trying out a new feature this week: a rundown of the funniest and most memorable moments from the comedy shows.
“The Tonight Show” had Alec Baldwin playing “Box of Lies” with Jimmy Fallon on Thursday night, featuring a giant gummy bear (and we mean giant), dueling impressions of Mr. Trump and a Chewbacca Mom mask.
• At the movies.
“A United Kingdom” explores a 1940s interracial romance spanning Britain and what is now Botswana.
There’s also “Fifty Shades Darker,” a sequel to “Fifty Shades of Grey.” The new movie is “almost bad enough to recommend,” our critic writes. If you don’t feel like going out, we have some suggestions on what to stream this weekend.
• Jacqueline Kennedy’s refusal.
In November 1967, four years after her husband’s assassination, Mrs. Kennedy traveled to Cambodia with David Ormsby Gore, a British friend of her husband’s and a recent widower.
A few months later, Mr. Ormsby-Gore proposed. The rejection letter from Mrs. Kennedy, who had decided to marry Aristotle Onassis, is coming up for auction.
Almost half of Americans in their early 20s get help from their parents to pay the rent.
Among those who get help, the average received is about $3,000 a year.
Shirley Chisholm. Jesse Jackson. Ben Carson. And, of course, Barack Obama.
The list of African-American presidential candidates includes several household names, but George Edwin Taylor, the son of a slave who was arguably the first black nominee for the nation’s highest office, has largely been forgotten.
Taylor was born in Arkansas in 1857 but moved north with his mother, who was free, before the Civil War. He worked as a journalist and became politically active with the Republican and Democratic parties, but abandoned both, unconvinced that they were seriously addressing the issues facing blacks after Reconstruction.
The National Liberty Party, an all-black independent party, nominated Taylor for president in 1904. It was, however, largely symbolic; his name was not on the ballot and he did not officially receive any votes in an election won by Theodore Roosevelt.
Taylor died in 1925. Another 47 years passed before Chisholm became the first African-American candidate for a major party.
