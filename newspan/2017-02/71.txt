A nationwide injunction that has kept transgender students from using school bathrooms and other facilities that correspond with their gender identity will remain in place after the Trump administration decided not to challenge it in court. The move, announced Friday, ended an effort mounted by the Obama administration after the order was announced last year.
Trump Supporters: What Do You Think of the President’s Policies?
The New York Times would like to hear from President Trump’s supporters: What do you think about his policies so far?
“A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so,” officials from the Education and Justice Departments said in the letter.
The political environment has changed dramatically since then.
Sarah Warbelow, the legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a leading L.G.B.T. advocacy group, said the Justice Department’s decision on Friday to let the injunction stand could portend its position on a closely watched Supreme Court case: a lawsuit filed by a transgender student in Virginia, Gavin Grimm, against his school district.
Mr. Grimm sued the Gloucester County School Board two years ago after it denied him access to the boys’ bathroom and told him to use a separate bathroom in a converted janitors’ closet, the kind of arrangement the Obama administration rejected in its letter to schools in May.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled in Mr. Grimm’s favor in August, pointing to the Obama guidelines on transgender students and Title IX. The school board appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, where oral arguments are scheduled to begin next month.
