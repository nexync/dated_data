LONDON — President Trump spoke by phone on Monday with the president of Nigeria, whose countrymen have not heard from him in weeks.
Many of them have been wondering: Where is our president, and how is he doing?
The president, Muhammadu Buhari, 74, left Nigeria for a vacation on Jan. 19, which was later extended, his office said on Feb. 5, for medical tests and treatment in London. But Mr. Buhari’s aides have refused to provide details about his health or his whereabouts, or even to say whether they have been in touch with him.
The lack of clarity has spurred rumors — in a nation of 180 million that is known for its love of political intrigue and speculation — that Mr. Buhari might be in poor health or even that he might be dead.
One of Mr. Buhari’s predecessors, Umaru Yar’Adua, died in 2010 after a closely hidden chronic illness that led to a political crisis. Mr. Yar’Adua, who came from the largely Muslim north, was replaced by his vice president, Goodluck Jonathan, who came from the mostly Christian, oil-rich Niger Delta region in the southeast.
Mr. Yar’Adua’s illness and death unsettled the longstanding Nigerian tradition of rotating political power among leaders from different regions, tribes and faiths.
In Mr. Buhari’s absence, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a Christian and a Yoruba from the southwest, has been filling in — a situation that for many Nigerians brings back anxious memories of the political tensions of 2010.
The statement also said that Mr. Trump had “encouraged President Buhari to keep up the good work he is doing,” including the release in October of some of the hundreds of girls whom the Islamist militant group Boko Haram had abducted from a school in the town of Chibok in 2014.
Mr. Buhari’s special adviser for media and communications, Mr. Adesina; another spokesman, Garba Shehu; and an assistant, Bashir Ahmad, did not respond to requests for comment made via Twitter on Monday.
