Is This Really Marcel Proust in a Movie?
Is this the only known glimpse of Marcel Proust in a motion picture?
A university professor has discovered silent black-and-white film footage from 1904 showing a man wearing a bowler hat descending church steps at a wedding in Paris.
The professor, Jean-Pierre Sirois-Trahan, of Laval University in Canada, discovered the film in archives in Paris, he said. The scene provides but a glimpse of the man (four seconds into the footage), but Prof. Sirois-Trahan believes it could just be the only known footage of the influential French author.
Though many photos like this one exist of Marcel Proust, a professor believes he has found the only film footage of the French novelist.
Professor William C. Carter, author of a Proust biography, said that Proust, who died in 1922 at 51, would have been 34 at the time of the film. He said Proust was known to have attended the wedding in Paris. While there exist many photographs of Proust, there is no recording of the author’s voice and no known film footage, he said.
“It would be very important that we have this brief image of Proust in motion,” he said. Several experts had contacted him and were convinced it is Proust, he said, but he is not so sure.
He said the man shown on the film looked a little too young for 34.
Professor Sirois-Trahan said the marriage was of a friend of Proust, Armand de Guiche, with Elaine Greffulhe, in the church of the Madeleine in Paris.
According to the British Times Literary Supplement, Elaine was daughter of the Count and the Countess Greffulhe, who is said to have been an inspiration for the Duchess of Guermantes in Proust’s novel.
