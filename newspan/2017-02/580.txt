The Nets, still in the early stages of what promises to be a lengthy rebuilding process, traded the third-year shooting guard Bojan Bogdanovic to the Washington Wizards on Wednesday for a lottery-protected first-round pick in this year’s draft, along with shooting guard Marcus Thornton and forward Andrew Nicholson.
The Wizards also acquired power forward Chris McCullough in the deal, the Nets announced.
The Wizards, who are in third place in the Eastern Conference with a 34-21 record, are almost assured of making the playoffs, meaning the Nets will keep the draft pick and hold two first-round selections this year. The Celtics have the option of swapping their first-round pick this year for the Nets’ as part of the 2013 deal for Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett. But the selections are still rare assets for the Nets, who had in years past made a habit of giving them away in ill-advised deals. Now, the Nets are at least stockpiling for the future.
The Wizards added scoring punch to their bench: Bogdanovic, 27, has the second-highest average on the Nets this season, a career-high 14.2 points a game. It remains to be seen whether the Nets, who entered the N.B.A. All-Star break with a league-worst 9-47 record, will also try to package center Brook Lopez, their leading scorer (20.8 points a game), in a separate deal.
Thornton and Nicholson had played sparingly for the Wizards this season. Although Thornton’s contract expires at the end of the season, Nicholson has a guaranteed contract that runs through the 2018-19 season. He is scheduled to earn $6.4 million next season and about $6.6 million in the final year of his deal.
McCullough, a first-round pick of the Nets in 2015, has appeared in 14 games this season, averaging 2.5 points.
