The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show will conclude tonight in Manhattan.
The event, the most esteemed canine competition in the country, is very much a New York creation, named after the Westminster Hotel that once stood on Irving Place, where a group of hunters first came up with the idea.
More than 2,800 pups are put to the test in categories ranging from obedience to agility. Not only are there several new breeds this year — including the sloughi, the pumi, and the American hairless terrier — but the dogs have also been joined by cats.
How far we’ve come since the first show in 1877, which drew less than half as many four-legged entrants.
The prizes were provided by Tiffany & Company and a prominent biscuit company.
This year’s contest is taking place at Piers 92 and 94, along the West Side Highway, and at Madison Square Garden. Tickets for tonight’s main event range from $40 to $100.
