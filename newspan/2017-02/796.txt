Among other things, “Billions” is a show about American aristocracy, of two men burnishing a legacy that will etch their families’ names in the firmament for generations to come. One of the key distinctions between Chuck Rhoades and Bobby Axelrod is that they approach the same goal from different angles: Chuck is an old-money political climber, on a conventional (if currently twisty) path from United States attorney to the governor’s office, boosted by his father’s reputation and connections. Axe is a nouveau riche brawler from Yonkers, using hedge fund billions to bully his way to the status his name itself cannot afford. Hence the sizable donation necessary to change an august Manhattan performance space into “Axelrod Hall” last season — the dubious permanence of which I likened to Enron Field in Houston.
Hearing Chuck Sr. badger Wendy over her marriage recalled, for me, last year’s excellent documentary “Weiner,” about the former congressman Anthony Weiner’s failed campaign to become the mayor of New York City. Among the many casualties of that run — including, in a tangential way, the presidential ambitions of Hillary Clinton — was the marriage between Weiner and Huma Abedin, who also happened to a top Clinton aide. There was a time when Weiner and Abedin were securing their place in the aristocracy: They married the year after Weiner won the first of his seven terms in the House of Representatives — Bill Clinton officiated their wedding — and their union survived the first sexting scandal, nicknamed “Weinergate,” which led to his resignation from Congress. “Weiner” chronicles his attempt at a political comeback, which unravels after another round of sexts, sent under the pseudonym “Carlos Danger,” torpedoes his campaign for good.
Nobody can know for certain what goes on in a marriage, but political unions like the one between Chuck and Wendy — and Anthony and Huma, and Bill and Hillary — plainly involve considerations other than the boring-old conventions of trust, fidelity and happiness. We saw it last season, when Chuck and Wendy dined with a couple that does everything together and recoiled at their lovey-dovey intimacy. Chuck Sr. may seem like a sinister interloper in a relationship he knows nothing about, but he’s there to remind Wendy that she entered into a political marriage and that the arrangement calls for a certain amount of flexibility. A couple of scenes later, when Chuck advises Wendy to tell Oliver Dake the truth (“I don’t want you to lie for me”), it may be the most romantic moment they’ve ever had on the show. They even hold hands!
As it happens, Chuck is perilously close to the “Carlos Danger” moment that puts an end to his political career — and, presumably, an end to his marriage, which would no longer be of use to anyone. Facing Oliver’s investigation and a battery of lawsuits, Chuck expects to be fired by the attorney general, essentially ending his ambitions as a public servant. His solution has nothing to do with the cause of justice and everything to do with saving his hide: Task his three assistant United States attorneys to find a massive and impossible case against one of the attorney general’s adversaries in order to appease her. When that doesn’t work, he seizes on the opposite approach: Make a case against one of the attorney general’s closest advocates — in this case, the head of the Spartan Ives investment bank, played by Eric Bogosian — so firing him would look suspicious. 
With Chuck on defense, Axe can continue reviving Axe Capital’s business without having to look over his shoulder. That brings us two exciting new additions to the Axe family: Taylor, a gender nonconformist who’s making the leap from intern to staff; and Gus, the hypermasculine monster who’s taking Wendy’s place as in-house therapist. We don’t yet know how Taylor will manage with the frat house atmosphere of Axe Capital, but Axe hires on the merits after witnessing Taylor’s keen insight into a developing tech scam in China. Axe’s pitch to them — Taylor’s preferred pronoun, rather than “her” or “him” — shows a surprisingly progressive understanding of the value of workplace diversity. Noting Taylor’s tendency to “retreat behind aquarium walls,” Axe says: “What you don’t realize, Taylor, is that glass — it’s not a barrier, but a lens. It’s an asset. It’s what makes you good. You see things differently. That’s an edge.” Given that his office is mostly white and male, Axe may be guilty of selective insight, but he makes an excellent argument nonetheless.
As for Gus, his one-size-fits-all style of motivational bullying makes him a terrible fit at Axe Capital, but an immensely entertaining one while he lasts. No surprise to learn that Wags is a friend, but the office doesn’t really need two Wagses to crack the whip on wavering staffers. Gus does, however, have a good read on Wags’s sudden crisis of confidence, which seems endemic to a business environment that favors the young and hungry. When Wags blows up on a stranger for disrespecting a piece of sushi, Gus asks, “What’s churning those waters up so much that a little cub like that can break the levee?” Axe may be free and clear now, but with Wendy gone and his chief enforcer wavering, there are cracks in his levee, too.
 In all sincerity, ripe dialogue like that sets “Billions” apart from the scores of other knotty shows about corporate intrigue.
• Axe’s antihero appeal comes through in the opening scene, when he mocks Krakow for quoting Pindar and mocks the very idea of being invited on stage among other “global thought leaders.” He can be accused of many things — insider trading, obstruction of justice, etc. — but never of being pretentious.
• As if Chuck doesn’t have enough problems, Oliver gives Axe a golden opportunity to put him away for good. If Axe testifies that his $5 million payment to Wendy has anything to do with Chuck’s dropping his case against Axe, then he’ll get immunity and free himself from Chuck’s clutches. Axe is the type of person who would lie about the payment, but it would also mean losing Wendy for good, which he will likely consider more costly.
• The show’s willingness to use industry jargon without having to explain it is a philosophy held over from Brian Koppelman and David Levien’s “Rounders,” which is filled with authentic poker talk. So for the record, the “dead cat bounce” refers to a temporary, short-lived uptick in a bear market.
• The soundtrack often underscores the themes of the show, but ending the episode with Car Seat Headrest’s terrific single “Fill in the Blank” is more about propulsion. With Chuck emerging triumphant from his meeting with the attorney general, we’re sent out on a high.
