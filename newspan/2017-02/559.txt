Mary Childs and Christopher Scott Lane were married Feb. 25 at St. Mary’s Episcopal Church in Richmond, Va. The Rev. Canon Robert G. Hetherington, an Episcopal priest, officiated.
The bride, 30, who will be keeping her name, was until January based in New York as the United States financial correspondent for The Financial Times, the London-based newspaper. She is now based in Laguna Woods, Calif., working on a book on the money-management industry to be published by Flatiron Books, a division of Macmillan in New York. She graduated from Washington & Lee University in Lexington, Va.
She is a daughter of Margaret Noftsinger Childs and Eugene M. Childs Jr. of Richmond, Va. The bride’s father is the director of strategic projects at Union Bank & Trust in Richmond.
The groom, 32, known as Scott, is a songwriter and guitarist for the Congress, a touring rock band based in Richmond. He founded American Paradox, a record label there, that released his band’s recording in September. He graduated from Randolph–Macon College in Ashland, Va.
He is a son of Anna Dalton Lane of Richmond, and Gregory T. Lane of Mechanicsville, Va., and a stepson of Kristi C. Lane. The groom’s mother is the registrar at St. Catherine’s School, an Episcopal elementary and high school in Richmond. His father, who is retired, worked in Richmond, as a vice president in the wealth management group of BB&T bank.
The couple met in 2001 during high school (where both their mothers worked) and the following year were cast as boyfriend and girlfriend in the school play, "The Man Who Came to Dinner." But they did not begin dating until 2014.
