My father died last summer, a week shy of his 92nd birthday (no condolences, please; we were estranged for decades).
My sister had the task of cleaning out his home. Among the items that she disentombed: a 60-year-old bottle of Four Roses bourbon and a button from President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s second inauguration — both acquired, presumably, the same week in January 1957.
Attached to the dusty bottle was a receipt from Roy Campanella’s liquor store at 134th Street and Seventh Avenue, now Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. The Eisenhower button was attached to the receipt.
The liquor purchase was actually for two bottles ($7.99 each, plus tax). The first, a sip of it anyway, was to be offered to me at my bar mitzvah on Jan. 9, 1965, but the bottle shattered that morning on the way to the temple.
The Eisenhower button had the date Jan. 20, 1957, but because that was a Sunday, the president took the oath of office and delivered his second inaugural address on Jan. 21, my fifth birthday — the reason, if there was a reason, for acquiring two bottles.
I didn’t know about the second bottle until two weeks after my father’s death. I toasted him, in absentia, on Jan. 9 this year, the 52nd anniversary of my bar mitzvah. And I will think of him again on Jan. 21, my 65th birthday.
