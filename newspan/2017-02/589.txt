Bordered by Rye Brook, Rye City and Greenwich, Conn., Port Chester is a 2.4-square-mile village in the town of Rye in Westchester County. Along its eastern edge, the Byram River flows into Long Island Sound at Port Chester Harbor. Not far away, Interstate 287 meets Interstate 95. All of which makes this primarily working-class suburb of roughly 29,000 a hub of commerce surrounded by affluence and some lovely water vistas.
After several decades of blight, Port Chester began a revitalization in 1999 with the construction of the Waterfront at Port Chester mall, with its 14-screen multiplex and big-box stores. In 2011, the Thomas Lamb-designed Capitol Theater reopened downtown. Since 2012, three luxury rental buildings have been erected nearby, attracting tenants looking to walk to the train station and the village’s array of ethnic restaurants.
According to the Census Bureau’s 2011-2015 American Community Survey, there are approximately 10,000 housing units in the village. About a third are two-, three- and four-family homes near downtown. Another third are single-family capes, colonials, Tudors and raised ranches, many of them farther north, where streets are wider. Near the harbor, the Grey Rock neighborhood is a cluster of homes with private access to the water.
As of Feb. 1, there were 26 single-family houses on the market. The least expensive was a 1,380-square-foot, three-bedroom attached home listed at $299,000. The most expensive, at $6,999,000, was a 9,859-square-foot, six-bedroom waterfront property in Grey Rock. There were 13 multifamily homes for sale, from $315,000 to $600,000; 24 cooperative apartments priced from $39,000 to $245,000; and four condominiums, from $269,000 to $425,000.
The median sales price for single-family homes for the 12-month period ending Jan. 31 was $486,000, compared with $467,000 for the previous 12 months.
Emma Deehan described Port Chester as “a sweet mix of a suburban neighborhood feel and a bustling downtown.” In October, Ms. Deehan, 28, and her husband, Shane Deehan, 30, moved from a rental in Rye to a four-bedroom cape, bought for $465,000. The couple (he owns a trucking business; she is temporarily unemployed) enjoy their proximity to restaurants like Rye House, Mario Batali’s Tarry Lodge and Bartaco.
Port Chester is renowned for its restaurants. It is also known for its award-winning high school marching band and for the Clay Art Center, celebrating its 60th year promoting ceramic arts.

Incorporated in 1868, Port Chester was called Saw Pit throughout the 1700s, named for the large holes in which tree trunks were sawed into lumber used to build ships. It remained a shipbuilding center and a trading port until the arrival of the railroad in the second half of the 1800s. By the mid-20th century, the village was home to factories, including the Life Savers Candy Company and Fruit of the Loom, enticing immigrants from Europe and Central and South America. Today, the community is one of the most dense and most diverse in the county.
