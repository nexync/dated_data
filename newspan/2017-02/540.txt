In an art market that has been tempered by the uncertainty of world events — will President Trump implement tax reform? — and declining inventory, Sotheby’s on Monday announced 2016 fourth-quarter earnings of $65.5 million, compared with a loss of $11.2 million for that period the prior year.
“Collectors responded enthusiastically to the great collections and works we secured for sale,” Tad Smith, the president and chief executive of Sotheby’s, said Monday morning in a conference call with analysts and investors.
At the same time, full-year adjusted net income at Sotheby’s for 2016 was down about 30 percent to $99.6 million, compared with $143.1 million in 2015, reflecting a softening in the market that Sotheby’s has been trying to counter by diversifying its business.
In addition to bringing in Amy Cappellazzo’s art advisory business last year, Sotheby’s recently acquired Orion Analytical, the art-authentication firm; the Mei Moses Art Indices, which monitor the auction business; and hired Christy MacLear, the chief executive of the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, to help the auction house expand its advisory services for living artists and for artists’ estates and foundations.
Moreover, despite a reluctance on the part of auction houses to give away profits through guarantees — undisclosed sums promised to the sellers regardless of the outcome of a sale — Mr. Smith made clear in Monday’s conference call that Sotheby’s would use them when necessary.
