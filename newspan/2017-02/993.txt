Melania Trump thanked the actress and model Emily Ratajkowski on Twitter on Monday night for defending her against a reporter’s derogatory comment.
Ms. Ratajkowski said on Twitter earlier in the day that a reporter for The New York Times, whom she sat next to at an event on Sunday, had said, “Melania is a hooker.” Ms. Ratajkowski, who did not identify the reporter, defended the first lady.
In a response on Twitter on Monday night, Mrs. Trump praised women who support one another, mentioning Ms. Ratajkowski by her Twitter handle. “Applause to all women around the world who speak up, stand up and support other women!” she wrote.
The tweet was Mrs. Trump’s first since Saturday and only the fifth since her official White House account was created last month.
In a statement, The Times described the reporter’s comment as “inappropriate” and said editors had spoken with the reporter about it.
The Times did not identify the reporter.
