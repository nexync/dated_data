Joe Maldonado, 9, was in the car with his mother when she got the call in November telling them that he was barred from the Boy Scouts.
He knew what all the fuss was about, why the Northern New Jersey Council of the Boy Scouts of America said he had to leave a Cub Scout pack just weeks after he had joined.
“Because I was born a girl,” he said by phone on Thursday from his home in Secaucus, N.J.
This week, Joe put on a borrowed uniform and attended his first meeting as a member of the Maplewood Cub Scouts. He took the oath, was given a handbook and joined the other boys in learning how to cook. He also made plans to build model cars.
Joe became one of the first transgender children to join the organization after the Boy Scouts of America announced on Jan. 30 that it was reversing its policy of more than a century and would accept members based on the gender listed on their application.
He spoke a while longer before darting off to do other things. He was home from school because of the heavy snow.
The Northern New Jersey council was closed on Thursday because of the snow, and an email sent to Eric Chamberlin, a deputy scout executive there, was not immediately answered.
The move was the latest transformation of the Scouts’ approach to gender identity and sexual orientation. In 2013, the Boy Scouts of America ended its ban on allowing openly gay youths to participate in activities, and two years later, its ban on openly gay adult leaders.
Shortly after the policy reversal, Ms. Maldonado said on Thursday, she received a second call from the regional council saying that Joe could rejoin. She registered him in the Cub Scouts in Maplewood, a town about 18 miles southwest of Secaucus.
On his application, she marked that he is a boy, as Joe himself has been telling her since he was just more than 2 years old, she said.
At the Maplewood meeting, Joe did not yet have his own uniform, so he put on a borrowed one and dived into the activities.
