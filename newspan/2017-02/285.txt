Drawn by the meditative power of gardening, Cadbury has been growing, and pressing, plants to make cards for friends for as long as she can remember. It was while playing around with some pressed forget-me-nots, and placing them onto a photograph by the late Garry Winogrand, that she struck on the formula for her enchanting “Flower Head” series. It caught the attention of the musician Tennessee Thomas, who commissioned a collection for sale at the Deep End Club in Brooklyn. Cadbury soon began working under the moniker @p_r_e_c_i_s (French for “sketch” or “overlay”), sourcing found imagery from vintage books, at auctions and car boot fairs. In her hands, everything from a 1920s cigarette card to a haunting Xerox of Marilyn Monroe by Irving Penn is transformed into an ethereal flowering artwork. “It’s a way of giving another life to something that you’ve grown,” she says.
