It took nearly an hour for Alec Baldwin, this weekend’s host of “Saturday Night Live” and its resident impersonator of President Trump, to don a certain familiar orange wig and assume the role that has occasionally infuriated the current real-life occupant of the Oval Office. In the meantime, “S.N.L.” took plenty of satirical shots at the Trump administration, starting with the return of Melissa McCarthy as the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer.
She went on to use action figures and Barbie dolls to explain a new process of “extreme vetting”; chastised the news media for failing to report on terrorist attacks like “the Horror at Six Flags,” “the Slaughter at Fraggle Rock,” and “the Night they Drove Old Dixie Down”; and plugged some of Ivanka Trump’s merchandise, a bangle and a shoe (“These babies are real head-turners”), before introducing the new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, played by the “S.N.L.” cast member Kate McKinnon.
The Sessions character began to explain, “We all know there are two kinds of crime: regular and black,” only to be hastened away by Ms. McCarthy.
During “Weekend Update,” Ms. McKinnon showed up again as Senator Elizabeth Warren, in a short desk-side segment that referenced Tuesday’s incident when Ms. Warren was silenced by Republican senators for reading a letter from Coretta Scott King that criticized Mr. Sessions’s record on civil rights.
For her efforts, Ms. Jones is thrown out of NBC headquarters and onto the street. There she gets the last laugh when Melania Trump (played by Ms. Strong) mistakes her for the real Mr. Trump and invites her into a limousine.
