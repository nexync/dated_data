Middle Tennessee State, which like Georgia State has many low-income, minority students, began working with the big data company EAB in fall 2014. Since then, it has more than doubled its advising staff, to 78, expanded free tutoring to 200 subjects from about 20, redesigned 27 foundation courses and started monitoring student progress weekly.
Freshmen at the University of Michigan began using a tool in the fall that mixes their personal and academic data with data on how earlier students did, advice from them and study guides from professors. After students complete a survey about their expectations for success in a course, the program digs into the data to see if those expectations are realistic. When they sign on, it takes them through questions and answers in what feels like a conversation.
Tim McKay, the professor of physics, astronomy and education who created the application, called ECoach, said thousands of students who regularly used the application over six years of testing often earned a third of a letter grade higher — from a B- to a B, for instance — than those who did not use it.
