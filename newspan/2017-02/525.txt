Norman Rockwell’s most famous paintings are going on tour.
“Four Freedoms,” four World War II-era works inspired by Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1941 State of the Union address, will travel around the United States and France in the exhibition “Enduring Ideals: Rockwell, Roosevelt & the Four Freedoms,” scheduled to open in June 2018 at the New-York Historical Society.
The government turned the paintings, where were printed as covers of The Saturday Evening Post in 1943, into posters that helped raise $133 million for the war effort. They are “Freedom of Speech,” depicting a dignified Everyman standing up to speak his mind; “Freedom of Worship,” with a group in prayer; “Freedom From Want,” with an idyllic family dinner; and “Freedom From Fear,” which shows parents tucking in their children.
Other paintings and drawings by Rockwell and by contemporaries like J.C. Leyendecker, Mead Schaeffer and Dorothea Lange will accompany the “Four Freedoms” in the show.
The tour is organized by the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass., which will host the exhibition from June 2019 through August 2019. Other stops after that — totaling six, with a possible seventh in Washington — include the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich., the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia; and the Mémorial de Caen in Normandy, in France.
