In the 1990s, crate-digging hip-hop producers began unearthing Mr. Axelrod’s productions and sampling them widely, enamored with their thickness and complexity. Axelrod sounds appear on Lauryn Hill’s breakthrough album, “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill”; DJ Shadow’s “Endtroducing .....”; and Dr. Dre’s “2001,” as well as songs by De La Soul, Lil Wayne, Mos Def, Madlib, Kool G Rap and more.
