Somehow it’s been just a week and a half since President Trump issued his unannounced travel ban that left thousands of people stranded or detained, provoked protests at airports across the country and resulted in a barrage of lawsuits filed by states against the federal government declaring that the restrictions were un-American and unconstitutional.
Those lawsuits ricocheted across the judicial system and landed with extraordinary speed in San Francisco on Tuesday afternoon, before a federal appeals panel one rung beneath the nation’s highest court.
• We listen in as President Trump’s travel ban is litigated — and live-streamed — in a federal courthouse, joined by my colleague Jesse Wegman, who writes about the law for the Times’s editorial board.
• We examine a claim that the news media — The New York Times included — ignored or underreported a number of attacks by Islamic terrorists.
• And my colleague Wesley Morris joins to discuss why the 60-year-old words of the novelist James Baldwin captured in the film “I Am Not Your Negro” are so resonant right now.
• Adam Liptak on Tuesday night’s oral arguments in the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on President Trump’s targeted travel ban.
• Wesley Morris on why pop culture can’t deal with black male sexuality.
