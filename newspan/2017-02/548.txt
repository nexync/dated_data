The former W.N.B.A. player Candice Wiggins said her experience in the league was “toxic” and was a major reason she retired last season. In an interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune, Wiggins said that the culture in the league was “very, very harmful” and that she was targeted throughout her career for being heterosexual and popular.
Wiggins said that she was treated poorly because she was straight. Wiggins, a 30-year-old Stanford graduate, said she was bullied from the time she was drafted by Minnesota.
“Me being heterosexual and straight, and being vocal in my identity as a straight woman was huge,” said Wiggins, who played eight years in the league with four teams.
