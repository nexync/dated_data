In December 2016, median rents for one-bedroom apartments decreased in eight of the 10 most expensive American markets, compared with the same month a year earlier, according to a report published by the rental information website Zumper.com.
The only cities in the top 10 that didn’t have an annual drop were Seattle and Los Angeles.
The decrease in New York City was by far the biggest, at 9.1 percent. That’s good news for the city’s renters, but it’s relative: New York is still the second-most-expensive place in the country to rent an apartment, topped only by San Francisco. And while the median one-bedroom rent dropped below the $3,000 mark — to $2,980 — the national median is just $1,139.
