On Wednesday, those hopes were realized when Ms. Dick herself was named the first female police commissioner in Scotland Yard’s 188-year history.
A onetime beat cop in London’s West End, Ms. Dick, 56, said she was “thrilled and humbled” by the appointment.
The daughter of Oxford academics and a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge, Ms. Dick was head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard from 2011 to 2014, overseeing among other things the security operation for the London Olympics in 2012.
She left Scotland Yard in 2014 after 31 years to become general secretary at the foreign office.
Ms. Dick has held command roles in several counterterrorism operations; one operation went terribly wrong in 2005: She was the senior officer in charge when Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, a Brazilian who had been mistakenly identified as an attempted suicide bomber, was fatally shot by officers at a London subway station.
 “I think about what happened on that terrible day very, very often,” she said in 2014.
During the search for a new commissioner, the family of Mr. de Menezes wrote a letter to London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, about Ms. Dick’s potential role. “We have serious concerns about such an appointment and the signal it sends to the people of London,” they wrote.
But Mr. Khan and others defended Ms. Dick’s appointment. “This is a historic day for London and a proud day for me as mayor,” he said Wednesday.
Amber Rudd, the home secretary who appointed Ms. Dick with Mr. Khan’s counsel, called her an “exceptional leader” and implicitly highlighted her gender as a possible asset in some pressing issues facing Scotland Yard.
Of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, several have been led by women. But never London.
With Ms. Dick’s appointment, three of the most senior figures in British policing are now women, with Lynne Owens heading the National Crime Agency and Sara Thornton, one of Ms. Dick’s rivals for the Scotland Yard job, the chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council.
