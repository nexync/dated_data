City Center will present staged concert revivals of “Assassins,” “The Bubbly Black Girl Sheds Her Chameleon Skin” and “Really Rosie” this summer through the Encores! Off-Center season.
First up is “Assassins,” a musical about men and women who have tried to kill American presidents. Stephen Sondheim wrote the music and lyrics, and John Weidman wrote the book; the show ran off Broadway, at Playwrights Horizons, in 1991, and then had a Broadway production (delayed for years because of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks) presented by the Roundabout Theater Company in 2004.
The Off Broadway production received tepid reviews, but attitudes toward the show have changed considerably, and the Broadway production fared better, winning five Tony Awards, including for best musical revival. The City Center production is to be directed by Anne Kauffman, and will run from July 12 to 15.
The playwright Robert O’Hara (“Bootycandy”) will direct a two-night concert of “Bubbly Black Girl,” on July 26 and 27. The show, by Kirsten Childs, opened off Broadway, at Playwrights Horizons, in 2000; it is about Ms. Childs’ own journey to becoming a dancer.
Leigh Silverman will direct “Really Rosie,” a family musical about a girl in Brooklyn who dreams of being a star. The show features music by Carole King and a book and lyrics by Maurice Sendak; it opened off Broadway, at the Chelsea Theater Center, in 1980. The City Center production is to run from Aug. 2 to 5.
