Kevin Geer, a prodigious character actor best known for his work in theater, including roles on Broadway in the 2004 revival of “Twelve Angry Men” and Warren Leight’s family drama “Side Man,” died on Jan. 25 at his home in Manhattan. He was 64.
The actor Michael Mastro, a friend who appeared with Mr. Geer in both those plays, said that the cause appeared to be a sudden heart attack.
A lanky actor with sharp features, Mr. Geer was an Off Broadway fixture who could command a stage. “Mr. Geer rages, goes to pieces and exudes roguish charm,” Alvin Klein wrote in The New York Times in reviewing his performance in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s “Anna Christie” in 1990 at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven.
The playwright and director Kenneth Lonergan, a longtime friend who directed Mr. Geer in his 2012 comedy “Medieval Play” and his 2011 film “Margaret,” said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that “it’s hard to imagine New York theater without him,” adding that Mr. Geer was more forceful on the stage than on the screen.
On television, he had an emotional turn as an amnesiac sergeant on “M*A*S*H” in 1978 and later appeared on three different iterations of “Law & Order,” including a performance as a white supremacist who bombs a subway.
His last credited film role was as a security guard who takes advantage of a homeless heroin addict played by Jennifer Connelly in Paul Bettany’s film “Shelter” (2015).
Kevin Scully Geer was born in Reno, Nev., on Nov. 7, 1952. His father died when he was an infant, and he moved to Los Angeles with his mother, the former Claire Scully.
After graduating from a military academy in Southern California, Mr. Geer moved to New York to become an actor when he was 18.
He is survived by a stepsister, Barbara Joseph, and a stepbrother, Tim Alvarado.
