Budapest pulled out of the bidding for the 2024 Summer Olympics, leaving only two candidates for the Games: Paris and Los Angeles.
Two other formal bidders had dropped out earlier, Hamburg in 2015 and Rome in September.
More than 250,000 people had signed a petition demanding that Budapest drop its bid.
“Over a quarter of a million signatures have come together so this money is spent on modern hospitals and well-equipped schools instead of on the Olympics,” Andras Fekete-Gyor, chairman of Momentum Movement, the political group that organized the petition drive, told the BBC.
The desire to host the Games has faded in recent years as more and more cities have concluded that the Games are a potential financial disaster. Host cities have been left with white elephant stadiums, billions in bills and fewer economic benefits than they expected.
In response, the International Olympic Committee began an initiative called Agenda 2020 to make the Games less expensive to host, perhaps by holding some events in other countries.
The 2020 Summer Games are scheduled for Tokyo. Future Winter Games are scheduled for Pyeongchang, South Korea in 2018 and Beijing in 2022. Beijing faced only one other contender, Almaty, Kazakhstan.
The international committee is scheduled to choose the host city for 2024 in September. Bookmakers have Paris as the favorite but rate Los Angeles as a close runner-up.
