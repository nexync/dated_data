Leonid Slutsky, the Foreign Relations Committee chairman in the Russian State Duma, said Tuesday that he sees the accusations surrounding Michael T. Flynnâ€™s resignation as an attack on Russia and that relations with the United States continue to be on thin ice.
Michael T. Flynn, under scrutiny for his communication with Russia, resigned as President Trump's national security adviser late Monday.
