Russia sought an apology from Fox News on Monday after the host Bill O’Reilly described President Vladimir V. Putin as “a killer” during an interview with President Trump.
The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters that the description was “unacceptable, insulting,” according to the the Interfax news agency and state-run RIA Novosti agency.
In the interview, which aired on Sunday, Mr. O’Reilly asked Mr. Trump how he felt about the Russian leader.
The president’s response, which appeared to equate Mr. Putin’s actions with those of the United States, drew outrage and dismay on social media.
An open admirer of the Russian leader, Mr. Trump has taken a conciliatory approach toward Mr. Putin, whose tenure has been known for human rights abuses, the brutal suppression of political dissent and the unnatural deaths of many political opponents.
Mr. Peskov declined to comment on Mr. Trump’s response to Mr. O’Reilly.
