Two weeks after concerns arose about air safety at a government lab that handles deadly pathogens, officials said tests had found no risk.
Research was suspended on Feb. 16 in the lab, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, but resumed a few days later after the test results came in.
The concerns involved 180 nylon hoses that pump air into the protective suits that scientists wear while working with dangerous germs like the Ebola virus. The suits fully enclose the wearer, like a spacesuit, and provide their own air supply to prevent any possible risk that scientists could inhale an airborne germ.
On Feb. 13, the C.D.C. learned that the air hoses, which had been in use since 2005, had not been designed or tested for breathing safety. The potential worry was that the hose material might emit chemicals into the air supply that were unsafe to breathe. About 100 workers had used the equipment.
The problem was discovered when the C.D.C. ordered new hoses to replace the original ones, which had been installed when the laboratory opened in 2005. The manufacturer — which had provided the original hoses — informed the C.D.C. that its products were not meant for breathing.
After a few days of “fact-finding and understanding of implications,” officials halted research in the lab, said Thomas W. Skinner, a spokesman.
The C.D.C. collected air samples from the hoses and sent them to an outside, independent laboratory for testing. In a statement issued on Monday, the C.D.C. said that the air samples met the standard for breathable air set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
For now, scientists are continuing to use the original 180 hoses. But because the hoses are old, the C.D.C. plans to replace them soon, Mr. Skinner said.
