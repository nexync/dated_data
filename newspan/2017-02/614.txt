After last year’s #OscarsSoWhite backlash, this year’s Academy Awards looks to be more diverse.
Six black actors have received nominations. “Moonlight,” “Fences” and “Hidden Figures,” films featuring the struggles and achievements of black men and women, are in the running for Best Picture.
Regardless of what happens on Sunday night, these movies have already won several honors at the Black Reel Awards, the NAACP Image Awards and the African American Film Critics Awards.
The All Def Movie Awards, now in its second year, was started by the entertainment mogul Russell Simmons as a “hip-hop alternative” to the Oscars.
Along with the traditional categories, it features irreverent ones like “Most Likely to Steal Your Girl” and “Best Black Survivor in a Movie.” And last year, it poked fun at the diversity controversy with a “Best Helpful White Person” award.
This year’s ceremony took place on Wednesday, and will air against the Oscars on Sunday.
