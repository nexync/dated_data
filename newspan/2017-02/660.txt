Snapchat’s parent might be the most prominent company to seek an initial public offering this year. But until the start-up begins trading, that honor will briefly belong to Jose Cuervo.
The world’s biggest tequila maker announced the price range for its stock offering on Wednesday, seeking up to 15.3 billion pesos, or $742 million, in proceeds.
Factor in the “greenshoe,” Wall Street parlance for additional shares set aside to cover exceptional investor demand, and Cuervo is hoping to raise 17.5 billion pesos from its initial offering.
In a regulatory filing with the Mexican Stock Exchange, Cuervo’s parent company, Becle, said it intends to sell Cuervo’s shares between 30 pesos and 34 pesos each. At the midpoint of that range, Cuervo is set to finally begin trading this week after having hired Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase last year to work on the deal.
Since then, the company has had to weather volatility in the Mexican stock market, including turmoil that arose after Donald J. Trump’s election and subsequent questions about American-Mexican trade relations.
By seeking to go public, Becle is finally seeking a stock listing for its two-century-old business, one that stretches back to José Antonio de Cuervo y Valdés receiving land in what is now Mexico from the king of Spain.
Mr. Cuervo and his descendants in the Beckmann family have distilled tequila from the blue agave plants that sprout in the region of Tequila ever since. The Beckmanns are expected to retain control of the company even after the initial offering, though the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek is also expected to become a big investor through the stock sale.
Cuervo is the biggest producer of tequila worldwide, with roughly a third of the global market for the spirit.
