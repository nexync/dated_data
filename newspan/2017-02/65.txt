Playboy is returning to the bare essentials.
A year after the famed but struggling men’s magazine stopped featuring photographs of naked women, it has apparently had a change of heart. From now on, women will shed much of the scanty clothing that had been covering them up.
Playboy announced in October 2015 that it would stop publishing images of naked women, seeking to attract more advertisers and secure better placement on newsstands. For the past year, women in the magazine were not shown topless, and there was no explicit nudity.
Cooper Hefner, who returned to Playboy last year as its chief creative officer, had been openly critical of the magazine’s decision to ban nudes. In an interview last February with Business Insider, he said in no uncertain terms that he thought the choice did not make sense.
“When you have a company, and the founder is responsible for kick-starting the sexual revolution, and then you pluck out that aspect of the company’s DNA by removing the nudity, it makes a lot of people, including me, sit and say, ‘What the hell is the company doing?’” he said.
In a nod to the end of its experimentation, Playboy’s new issue features a blaring headline on the cover, with a letter artfully placed over part of a topless model.
“Naked is normal,” it reads.
