If Mr. Flynn was not entirely honest with the F.B.I. about his conversations with a Russian ambassador, it could expose him to a felony charge. Mr. Trump had known for weeks, his spokesman said, that Mr. Flynn had misled the vice president about the conversations.
The departure dampened hopes of improving Russian-American relations, just as news broke that Moscow had secretly deployed a new cruise missile in what U.S. officials said was a violation of a landmark arms control treaty.
• Other international pressures on the U.S. are building, as well.
China is urging the U.S. to enter talks with North Korea to end its nuclear weapons program — even after North Korea tested an intermediate-range missile in a significant stride — apparently sensing that Mr. Trump’s desire to make deals could break 16 years of deadlock.
And as Mr. Trump and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, meet today, a likely topic will be their hopes for an “outside-in” approach to the Palestinian conflict: collaborating with Arab countries worried about Iran, and using those relationships to press Palestinians in talks on a two-state solution.

As unlikely as it may sound today, Canada’s Maple Leaf flag was once the center of a dispute so bitter that historians named it: the Great Flag Debate.
When the Maple Leaf, or l’Unifolié (French for “the One-Leafed”), was officially adopted on this day in 1965, it was after decades of disagreement that had divided the public, mostly along lines of British and French colonial roots.
The country had flown a flag featuring the Union Jack, under which Canadian troops fought in two world wars. Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, though, wanted a banner that would unify Canadians, not just represent those with British ties.
And a 1958 poll showed that more than 80 percent of the population wanted a flag entirely different from any other country’s.
Tree references show up in other flags. Think of Lebanon’s cedar tree, or the popular use of the olive branch, as in the United Nations’ logo.
Canada’s maple leaf was carefully designed. Its 11 points were decided on after a wind tunnel test to see how the leaf would look flapping in the breeze.
