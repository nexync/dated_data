It seems as if the entire world is on edge, with xenophobia the word of our times, and though it has been long-planned, the United States premiere of “A Man of Good Hope” could hardly be better timed. The musical drama, which begins at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday, Feb. 15, is based on a book (by Jonny Steinberg) about the true story of Asad Abdullahi, born in Somalia and orphaned as a boy, who trekked to South Africa only to face violence there.
