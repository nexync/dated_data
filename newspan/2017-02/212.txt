It will cost the New York Police Department significantly less to provide presidential protection and to guard Trump Tower than the city had initially estimated, according to the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill.
In a letter to members of the New York delegation to Congress seeking reimbursement for the Police Department’s expenses, Commissioner O’Neill noted that it had cost the police about $24 million to provide security to President Trump and his family in New York as well as to guard Trump Tower during the two and a half months between Election Day and Inauguration Day — a figure well below the $35 million that the police had initially estimated.
That would come out to about $50 million a year if Mr. Trump avoided returning to Manhattan, or just over $60 million if he began returning on weekends.
Mr. O’Neill’s letter did not provide an itemization of the costs associated with providing presidential security, but a good chunk of it appears to be payroll costs associated with maintaining a police presence around Trump Tower, which is on Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th streets.
So far, the federal government has reimbursed the city for about $7 million.
