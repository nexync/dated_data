Prince’s music, which came to most online streaming services on Sunday — just hours before the Grammy Awards, where a Prince tribute with Bruno Mars was a highlight — made a big splash in its first two days of availability.
According to data from Nielsen released on Thursday, songs by Prince were streamed 4.7 million times on Sunday and Monday in the United States, compared with just 37,000 streams on Saturday. Pandora reported that 686,348 listeners added a Prince station to their accounts on Monday.
For almost two years, Tidal had been the only streaming outlet to have Prince’s catalog, but deals recently struck by his estate allowed the portion of his music that was originally released on the Warner Bros. label — including virtually all of his major hits, like “Purple Rain” and “1999” — to go online. Last week, the estate announced a deal with the Universal Music Group for the rest of Prince’s catalog.
