WESTHAMPTON BEACH, N.Y. — A single-engine plane whose pilot was practicing takeoffs and landings at a small airport on Long Island crashed on Sunday, killing two of the people on board and injuring the third, officials said.
The plane, a Navion F aircraft, crashed into trees at 11:40 a.m. at the Francis S. Gabreski Airport in the town of Southampton, N.Y., just outside the village of Westhampton Beach, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The airport is owned by Suffolk County.
By early evening, law enforcement officials had not released the identities of the victims. Kathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the F.A.A., said the National Transportation Safety Board would oversee the investigation and determine the probable cause of the crash.
On a clear but windy day, the private plane crashed in a field next to the airport, in an area off Runway 33 that is filled with short scrub pines, according to Chief Michael Sharkey of the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office. Chief Sharkey could not say what the nature of the flight was. The airport was quiet on Sunday afternoon, and all plane traffic was halted in the aftermath of the crash. Chief Sharkey said the airport would reopen shortly.
The Navion is a popular single-engine plane that was made after World War II. According to Ron Judy, an aircraft mechanic in Oklahoma who is a past board member of the American Navion Society, 1,200 Navions are still registered in the United States, including only about a half-dozen F models like the one that crashed.
Students typically do not learn to fly on the Navion. More experienced pilots are better able to handle its retractable landing gear and some other features.
The Navion F carries four passengers and weighs about 3,150 pounds when loaded, Mr. Judy said. While most Navions were manufactured from 1946 to 1951, the F model — a remake of an original — was produced in the late 1950s with a bigger engine.
