Bjarne Melgaard has not smoked crystal meth any time lately. The divisive Norwegian visual artist is quick to make that point, lest anyone think a short film he created — part of a sweeping multidisciplinary exhibition, “The Casual Pleasure of Disappointment,” opening Thursday at Red Bull Arts New York — implies that drug use is a part of his daily routine. The clip in question follows a puppet created with Jim Henson Company, which closely resembles Melgaard, as he window shops, scrolls through Instagram surrounded by piles of clothing, stares contemplatively at his reflection in the bathroom mirror at a gay bar and, briefly, clutches a meth pipe.
