With Adele and Beyoncé relegated to smaller roles, David Bowie’s final album, “Blackstar,” took home the highest honor at this year’s Brit Awards on Wednesday for the top British album of the year.
The absence of such pop titans allowed the Brits, Britain’s top pop music prize, to focus more on smaller, more localized acts, such as the pop group Little Mix (who won best British single for “Shout Out to My Ex,” which they also performed) and the singer Rag’n’Bone Man (who took home the British breakthrough act award). The Scottish singer Emeli Sandé won best British female solo artist and the electro-pop stars the 1975 won best British group, beating Radiohead, who have oddly never won a Brit Award.
