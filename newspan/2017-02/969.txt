Lodged in a former brewery with vintage-inspired interiors, the Hotel Emma in San Antonio attracts patrons from around the city to its restaurant and bar. But only guests who have checked in have the key to the two-story lobby library where a staff member mixes complimentary margaritas.
“When you’re paying a lot of money and you’ve selected a hotel, you do want a little bit of exclusivity,” said Beth Ticku Smith, the director of marketing for the Hotel Emma.
In efforts to preserve some peace for paying guests, trendy hotels are adding private areas only for overnighters as special incentives.
At the new Robey hotel in Chicago, a glassed-in bar on the 13th-floor rooftop offers space for 35 seated patrons. CitizenM New York Times Square reserves its top-floor bar and terrace for guests.
After 4 p.m., the two-level library at the NoMad Hotel in New York is reserved for guests. In London, only those staying at the One Aldwych hotel in Covent Garden have access to its ground-floor Lounge at One.
