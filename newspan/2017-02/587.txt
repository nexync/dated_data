“The Classical Style” — the musical principles conceived by Haydn in the 18th century — will be the theme of the 2017-18 season at the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.
That theme opens many doors for programming: The classical period’s champions and inheritors include Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert, whose music will appear in a variety of concerts from Oct. 17 through May 20.
While the society’s programming reaches back to stalwarts of the Western canon — particularly in the all-Mozart opening night concert, “Classical Epicenter: Mozart in 1787,” on Oct. 17 — the season will also include several premieres, including “...there is no one, not even the wind,” a new work for two flutes and a small ensemble by John Luther Adams (Nov. 19).
The Danish String Quartet, a young group whose previous New York appearances have been both commercial and critical hits, will return to the society on Feb. 25. They will perform “The Thrill of the Hunt,” a program that includes Haydn, Mozart and Brahms — as well as “Jagdquartett,” Jorg Widmann’s 2003 work that parodies the romanticism of hunting in the 18th century.
Other highlights include a festival of 1820s Viennese chamber music (March 13-27) and a 100th birthday celebration of Leonard Bernstein with a performance of his 1988 song cycle “Arias and Barcarolles,” featuring the mezzo-soprano Tamara Mumford and the baritone Nathan Gunn. The season will conclude on May 20 with an evening of concertos by five composers including Mozart, Bach and Janacek.
The full lineup, which features 136 artists, is at chambermusicsociety.org.
