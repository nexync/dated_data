The picture hangs alongside those of Bianca Jagger, Linda Evangelista and Cher (in a sequined Bob Mackie number) on a mood board in Halpern’s matchbox-size East London studio. “It’s not just what they looked like,” says Halpern, 29, who, in contrast with his sequined goddesses, is dressed entirely in black. “But there was such grace, confidence and poise.” After all, a woman would need all those qualities in spades to pull off Halpern’s after-dark aesthetic — a high-wire balancing act between disco glitz and couture-grade finish. His standout Central Saint Martins MA show last year won him his dream job designing couture for Atelier Versace as a consultant; he already counts Beyoncé as a fan; he has an impressive list of stockists, including Bergdorfs and matchesfashion.com; and he’s accomplished all this before he’s even staged his first official show, which will take place this weekend in London.
Halpern was born in upstate New York. His father was a nuclear mechanical engineer and his mother a bank teller. He remembers his mother and her friends telling him about dancing at Studio 54 or at the bar at the St. Regis Hotel. Those stories inspired his ongoing love affair with the hedonism of the ’70s. “There were less constraints and oppression back then,” he says. “It wasn’t so correct.” After graduating with a women’s wear degree from Parsons in 2010, Halpern went on to hold design jobs at both J. Mendel and Oscar de la Renta, where he honed classical skills of plissé, draping and hand-pleating. But it wasn’t until he moved to London to do an MA at Central Saint Martins that he learned to embrace his love of both “trash,” as he calls it, and elegance.
