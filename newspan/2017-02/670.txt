VARIETY PUZZLE — If you were an elementary school-age child in New York City in the 1970s, as I was, you heard a lot about Esperanto. Esperanto, which means “The Hoping One,” is an auxiliary language that was a construction of Dr. Ludwig Zamenhof in the 19th century, and while it may be responsible for fostering good communication between countries with differing languages, it was used as a tool to keep students on their best behavior where I went to school.
Anyway, Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon offer us a fairly tough acrostic today that only yielded two gimmes for me, and that was the Star Trek clue (WORF) and the Death Valley clue (SEA LEVEL). The rest of the puzzle was a tug-of-war, but that’s a fine indoor sport to play on a cold winter weekend.
Let’s hear from our constructors.
Saluton al ĉiuj!
