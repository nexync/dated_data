MILAN — Never heard of Samuele Failli before? If not, you’re still likely to have seen a lot of his shoes.
Mr. Failli, an Italian footwear designer, has spent much of the last 20 years designing for some of the biggest names in the luxury business, including Prada, Tom Ford, Saint Laurent and, most recently, Azzedine Alaïa.
Now, the 40-year-old designer has decided to step out on his own, quietly introducing a collection with his own name during Milan Fashion Week.
Standouts from the debut line, which ranged from flat slippers to laser-cut stilettos, included silver-studded velvet bootees in black, plum, raspberry and green, either with cutaway sides and ankle straps, or laced and an able-to-go-the-distance wedge.
“I have worked at the crazy pace the fashion world demands my whole life, he said. “With these shoes, I wanted to step away from seasonality and move towards timeless looks that would last instead.” He also is London, where he has been living, to return to Milan.
It looks like the buyers were convinced. Matchesfashion.com has agreed to stock him online and Barneys New York has signed him to an exclusive two-year contract.
