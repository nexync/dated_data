Thursday was pizza night. Although I was 12 and the youngest in my family, somehow the responsibility fell to me. My mother would leave a crisp $20 bill on the foyer table. I would grab it on my way to school and stuff it firmly into my jean-jacket pocket.
One Thursday, a group of boys surrounded me, looking me up and down. I didn’t know what they wanted. I looked down at my untied sneakers.
Like a miracle, they left me alone. I was just minutes from the hot cheese when I heard her.
Still shaken, I did the unthinkable.
It’s not as if she shoved me, or pulled my hair. She just asked for some change, and I volunteered my money, straight up.
“Just wait here, and I’ll bring you change,” she said.
She and the girls she was with took off, laughing loudly.
I waited almost an hour before realizing they weren’t coming back.
I went to a bodega and asked to call home.
“O.K., but it will have to be a collect call,” the owner said.
My brother accepted the call. He walked over and got me, and together we got the pizza. Later, my father asked me in a soft tone to tell him what had happened.
I told him, crying a little.
The next time?
