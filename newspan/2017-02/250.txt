Stanley Bard, who nurtured many talents as the manager and part-owner of the Chelsea for 40 years, died on Tuesday. Here is a look at some of the artists who have passed through its doors.
The writer spent the last years of his life at the Chelsea. In Room 829, he was known to have produced the manuscript for the novels “You Can’t Go Home Again” and “The Web and the Rock,” which were published after he died in 1938.
Several months later during his travels, he died of tuberculosis that migrated to his brain.
The singer-songwriter and poet is said to have met Janis Joplin in the hotel’s elevator in 1968.
He was said to have been drinking in Greenwich Village at the White Horse Tavern, which was known as a gathering place for writers and artists. He died several days later, on Nov. 9, 1953, at nearby St. Vincent’s Hospital. He was 39.
John Ritchie, otherwise known as Sid Vicious, the drug-addicted bassist of the punk rock group the Sex Pistols, was arrested in a blood-spattered Room 100 and charged in the stabbing death of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen, in 1978.
He died of an overdose in February 1979 while he was free on bail and awaiting trial.
In 1986, the episode, including the stabbing, was recreated in the film “Sid and Nancy,” starring Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb as the couple.
The author of more than 100 books of science fiction and essays, he said he and the director Stanley Kubrick wrote the screenplay for the film “2001: A Space Odyssey” during a stay at the hotel in the 1960s.
