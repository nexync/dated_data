This was the weekend that America met Stephen Miller, a wiry 31-year-old who favors thin black ties and steering conversation back to his signature subject: immigration.
Whether you watched NBC’s “Meet the Press” or “Fox News Sunday,” ABC’s “This Week,” or CBS’s “Face the Nation,” there was Stephen Miller.
