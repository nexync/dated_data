WASHINGTON — As a clandestine officer at the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002, Gina Haspel oversaw the torture of a terrorism suspect and later took part in an order to destroy videotapes documenting the brutal interrogations at a secret prison in Thailand.
The C.I.A.’s first overseas detention site was in Thailand. It was at one point run by Ms. Haspel, who oversaw the brutal interrogation of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.
Another detainee, Abu Zubaydah, was tortured at the site before Ms. Haspel took charge. He was waterboarded 83 times in a single month, had his head repeatedly slammed into walls and endured other harsh methods before interrogators decided he had no useful information to provide.
