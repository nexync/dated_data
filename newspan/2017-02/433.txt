Ask yourself if the pain needs urgent medical attention or if it is something you can self-manage. “It is important to understand the difference between danger and damage,” Tauben says. If you sense danger, seek trusted medical attention immediately to get a diagnosis. Otherwise, deep breathing and relaxation techniques can help in the short term, while “visual, auditory or breathing exercises to calm the pain system are helpful — diaphragmatic breathing to relax or yoga or tai chi help,” Tauben says.  Basic lifestyle choices, like a healthy diet and exercise, can influence pain self-management in the long-term. A behavioral-health trainer or physical therapist might also be able to help.
 “Think of a nice place where you’re safe, and go to that place in your mind’s eye,” Tauben says. “You have to train yourself to be in a calm, comfortable place physically or emotionally and practice that feeling when things are going well, so that when things aren’t going well, you can get back to it.” Set the scene: a beach, its smells, the sound of the waves. Imagine what all five senses are experiencing.
