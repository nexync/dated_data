Movies|Two Projects Are Filming Again. Here’s How They’re Doing It.
In Iceland, a Netflix series relied on testing and color-coded armbands. In Australia, the entire cast and crew of a Stephen King adaptation quarantined together.
In March, Kormakur began filming “Katla,” an eight-episode supernatural drama centered on a subglacial volcano that disturbs a tranquil small town. Four days into filming on a 50,000-square-foot soundstage that he owns, the government shut the production down along with the rest of the country. Sheltering at home with his four children, Kormakur engineered a system he thought would allow the cast and crew to return once the virus had peaked.
