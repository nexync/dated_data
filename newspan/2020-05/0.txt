He’s everywhere, this lavender-sweatered Mister Rogers for the curious and quarantined.
Beyond the $300 million that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has given to blunt the spread of the virus, Gates has made himself a spokesman for science. It needs one. While President Trump spouts life-threatening nonsense, Gates calmly explains how a spike protein of coronavirus fits into the urgent hunt for a vaccine.
He’s the prophet who warned in 2015 that a pandemic was a greater risk to humankind than nuclear war. Five years before that, he challenged the world health community to commit to a decade of vaccines, and anted up $10 billion to get it started.
It’s uncanny how spot-on he was in that 2015 speech. The greatest threat to the world was “not missiles but microbes,” he said. “You have a virus where people feel well enough while they’re infected so they get on a plane,” he said.
The first major American outbreak, in a nursing home just 11 miles from Gates’s house near Seattle, made him regret that he had not spoken out even more. He had warned Trump, just before he took office, of the seismic dangers of a pandemic.
Now, of course, Gates is the boogeyman in the fevered minds of many a delusional Trumper. The global lunacy community — anti-vaxxers, science deniers, Russian agents — has spread so many conspiracy theories regarding Gates that misinformation about him is now among the most widespread of all coronavirus falsehoods.
The crackpots who have targeted Gates include Roger Stone, Laura Ingraham and the anti-vaxxer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Would you get in a lifeboat with that trio?
The world needs a strong American response precisely because the disease has become a huge American problem. With less than 5 percent of the world’s population, the United States accounts for more than 30 percent of the planet’s coronavirus cases. When Trump snubs the World Health Organization, he hurts American citizens.
