The supernatural series followed the romance between a handsome vampire, Edward Cullen, and his human (and then vampire) love interest, Bella Swan, as well as the stories of their family and friends — a circle that includes humans, vampires, werewolves and even a vampire-human hybrid in the Pacific Northwest. In contrast to earlier books, which were told from Bella’s perspective, the new book will look back on Edward’s life and be told from his view.
Since the release of the first book, “Twilight,” in 2005, the series has cultivated millions of fans worldwide and generated five major movies, starring Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. The first was “Twilight” in 2008, followed by “New Moon,” “Eclipse,” “Breaking Dawn — Part I” and 2012’s “Breaking Dawn — Part 2” which was the last chapter in the multimillion-dollar series.
For over a week, “Twilight” fans had speculated that Ms. Meyer would soon announce a new book in the series: Her personal website had a countdown ticking toward 8:30 a.m. on Monday morning, set against a starry sky and a forest background reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest. When the countdown reached zero, fans flocking to learn the news apparently crashed her site.
The publisher announced a first printing of 750,000 for “Midnight Sun” in hardcover, large print, e-book and audio editions.
