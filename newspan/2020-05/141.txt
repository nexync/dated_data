HOLLYWOOD PARK: A Memoir, by Mikel Jollett. (Celadon, $27.99.) This memoir, by the lead singer of the indie band the Airborne Toxic Event, is far from your standard rock autobiography, and no wonder: Jollett was born into a violent cult and overcame a chaotic youth.
I LIVE IN THE SLUMS: Stories, by Can Xue. Translated by Karen Gernant and Chen Zeping. (Yale University, $26.) Sixteen dreamlike stories, translated from the Chinese, merge the physical and the philosophical: A woman ponders the structure of the universe, a giant mouse gnaws a man’s heels to the bone.
DON’T SHED YOUR TEARS FOR ANYONE WHO LIVES ON THESE STREETS, by Patricio Pron. Translated by Mara Faye Lethem. (Knopf, $26.95.) In 1945 Italy, a writer is found dead at a Fascist conference. Decades later, a young radical seeks answers. This novel, by a celebrated Argentine writer, probes art, crime and politics.
I DON’T EXPECT ANYONE TO BELIEVE ME, by Juan Pablo Villalobos. Translated by Daniel Hahn. (And Other Stories, paper, $17.95.) A crime lord forces a Mexican student into service as a romantic middleman and intellectual sparring partner in this entertaining farce.
A SONG FROM FARAWAY, by Deni Ellis Béchard. (Milkweed, paper, $16.) A novel in stories, Béchard’s fourth work of fiction follows one family from 19th-century Canada to modern Iraq, through war and spiritual yearning.
I have a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old tearing up my apartment at the moment — so now is a good time to read things that are short! Enter poetry.
One book I keep returning to is Richard Siken’s CRUSH, published in 2005. The poems are vivid, heaving things, stuffed with obsession and surprises. They feel incredibly alive, which makes a nice change as I continue to sit in my living room.
The poems aren’t comforting, but they’re invigorating. This is a book about thrashing around in the great big world, being messy, being alive.
