Real Estate|Can a Landlord Enter a Tenant’s Home if It’s Currently Empty?
Landlords cannot arbitrarily take possession of any apartment, whether or not we’re in the middle of a health emergency.
Q: My brother died last week, probably from Covid-19. The management company of his Manhattan rental building told me that the family usually has 14 days to empty the apartment, but they would check if anything has changed because of the pandemic. I can’t possibly meet that deadline because I am 79, live in Connecticut and have a medical condition. There is no way that I can risk going to New York City to clear out the apartment and I am reluctant to put anyone else at risk right now. What rights do I have?
A: Your brother’s landlord cannot arbitrarily take possession of his apartment or his belongings, whether or not we’re in the middle of a health emergency.
Currently, the landlord can’t even start the process because the courts are closed except for emergency cases, and evictions are not considered emergencies. Moreover, a statewide moratorium on evictions is in place until at least mid-June.
So you don’t have to rush to clear out his belongings, nor should you make any unnecessary travel plans. Call the management company and tell them to leave your brother’s belongings and his apartment alone. If they continue to pressure you, contact a lawyer to write a letter on your behalf. If they attempt to enter the apartment, call the police.
You could also contact the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants for assistance. The New York Legal Assistance Group has a Covid-19 hotline available from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., Monday through Friday, at |||PHONE_NUMBER||| .
