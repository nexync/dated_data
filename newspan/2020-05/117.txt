The Trump administration is challenging Chinese access to Taiwan’s high-tech supply chain — and, by extension, Beijing’s influence over the island it claims as its territory.
The next day, the Department of Commerce announced a rule change that could stymie the business the Chinese tech giant Huawei does with T.S.M.C. and other global chip manufacturers.
China’s Ministry of Commerce condemned Washington’s latest move against Huawei, saying it would do what was necessary to protect the interests of Chinese businesses.
As of Tuesday, some administration officials were already discussing ways to strengthen the rule, two people familiar with the deliberations said.
In an emailed comment, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, said his department was charged with catching and punishing intermediaries and front companies that circumvent its regulations, and that it does so regularly. “Any collusion with Huawei or its affiliates to willfully violate this rule is prohibited, and any party found to be in violation will be barred from further access to U.S. equipment or software,” Mr. Ross said.
“I feel differently now about that deal than I did three months ago,” Mr. Trump said Tuesday afternoon of his trade pact with China.
In April, Mr. Trump halted funding for the W.H.O., criticizing it for “pushing Chinese misinformation,” and on Monday he threatened to pull the United States out of the organization. Also on Monday, his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, condemned the W.H.O. for excluding Taiwan from its annual meeting, saying that Beijing was trying to “silence” Taiwan.
