Technology|People Are Panic-Buying Meat, Toilet Paper … and Pelotons?
Since mid-March, Peloton’s stock has soared 95 percent, valuing the New York company at $10 billion, or twice as much as the gym chain Planet Fitness. Last month, Peloton reported a record: More than 23,000 people had joined one of its live classes.
On Wednesday, Peloton said its revenue rose 66 percent in the first three months of 2020 from a year earlier, while it recorded a wider net loss. The company ended the quarter with a “backlog” of bike deliveries; it also signed up 1.1. million people to digital-only free trials in March and April.
Its 2.6 million paying members worked out an average of 18 times a month, up from 13 in the previous quarter, the company said. Peloton added that it expected its revenue to more than double in the current quarter.
Peloton initially responded to the virus by extending a 30-day free trial of its digital-only subscription to its streaming classes to 90 days. It introduced contactless delivery for its equipment and pledged to waive up to $1 million of subscription fees for customers who had lost their jobs or were unable to work because of the coronavirus. Peloton also closed 97 showrooms around the country and stopped delivering the treadmills it also makes.
