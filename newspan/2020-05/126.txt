Style|Smash a Coronavirus Piñata. You’ll Feel Better.
Buy one or make one, then destroy it.
In Durham, N.C., Xaris Martínez, 37, a historian at the Center for Documentary Studies at Duke University, used tinfoil and toilet paper rolls to fabricate a “true-to-life” coronavirus piñata for the lonely 33rd birthday of her friend Haley Schomburg. “She’s an extrovert — if this wasn’t happening, it would’ve been an event,” Ms. Martínez said.
Ms. Schomburg is saving her coroñata for such an occasion. So is Katie Hanlon, 27, a schoolteacher in Southampton, England. “It’s hanging in my window at the moment,” she said, dreamily. Ditto Steven Limon, 29, a delivery driver who scored his last month at a piñateria in Mexicali, Mexico.
