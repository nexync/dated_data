New York|Lights. Camera. Makeup. And a Carefully Placed 1,246-Page Book.
‘The Power Broker,’ a biography by Robert Caro, has become a must-have prop for numerous politicians and reporters appearing on camera from home.
Jake Sherman, a senior writer for Politico.
Jonathan Capehart, of The Washington Post.
Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller, during a City Council finance committee hearing on May 21.
Errol Louis, the host of NY1’s Inside City Hall.
It’s the sort of book that makes its presence felt. It is quite large, the letters along its spine are big and bright, and readers are required to own it in print, because Mr. Caro, who still uses a typewriter, has refused to distribute the written version in any other way.
New York State’s physical contours owe much to Moses. He built the Robert F. Kennedy, Bronx-Whitestone and Verrazzano-Narrows Bridges; Jones Beach State Park; public pools; public housing; and public parkland. He was also an unfettered champion of the automobile, and he built parkways and highways throughout the region, displacing poor families and discomfiting wealthy Long Island landowners.
