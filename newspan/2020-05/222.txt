The artist continues his campaign for free speech and human rights with face coverings whose sales will benefit humanitarian organizations.
One mask depicts a middle finger, stuck defiantly upward, silk-screened in black ink on a blue background. Others feature sunflower seeds, a surveillance camera or creatures from ancient Chinese mythology. All these masks are works by the artist and dissident Ai Weiwei.
The assortment of masks, made of nonsurgical cloth, will be sold on eBay for Charity, from Thursday until June 27, to raise funds for humanitarian and emergency relief efforts around the coronavirus pandemic.
So he began to design more of the masks, which are now being hand-printed in his studio in Berlin. All proceeds will go to Human Rights Watch, Refugees International and Doctors Without Borders. A single mask will sell for $50. Thematic sets of four will sell for $300, and a collection of 20 will sell for $1,500.
Many of the images on the masks relate to Mr. Ai’s campaign for free speech and human rights globally. The mask itself has had many shades of political implications in its history, ranging from revolution to robbery, Mr. Ai said, which makes it a powerful and charged canvas. “It’s like a political ready-made,” he said.
