With its cheerfully crowd-seeking title, “Golden Kingdoms: Luxury and Legacy in the Ancient Americas,” the Metropolitan Museum’s exhibition of pre-Columbian art promises an unabashed celebration of splendor. Offering more than 300 objects spanning nearly 2,500 years, and representing cultures from the Moche, Wari and Inca to the Olmec, Maya and Aztec, it delivers in full. Riches abound.
Despite its allure, gold was not the most prized material in pre-Columbian cultures. For the earliest, which date to the second millennium B.C., that status was held by woven and embroidered textiles, which take longer to make. Surpassing value was also placed on the pinkish shells of spondylus, a species of spiny oyster. Feather workers were more esteemed than gold workers — and indeed they produced wonders, as in a series of shockingly vibrant panels made with tens of thousands of blue and gold macaw feathers by the Wari of Peru in A.D. 600-900, their function unknown. In Mesoamerica jade was favored. And in whatever material, all the luxury items on display were “efficacious,” says the exhibition’s co-curator, Joanne Pillsbury. (Now at the Met, Ms. Pillsbury led this show’s considerable curatorial and research team while she was at the Getty Research Institute, a sister organization of the Getty Museum, where “Golden Kingdoms” originated.) That is to say, these luxuries were believed to be animated by gods, and to consolidate — and radiate — power.
Nothing about the 21st century’s vaunted cosmopolitanism would have surprised them. They might have been confused, though, by our tendency to look to history — non-European in particular — for a material record of lost innocence.
