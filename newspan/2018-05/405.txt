Courtney Byrne-Mitchell and Mattie Jennie Ettenheim were married May 12 at the Golden Unicorn restaurant in the Chinatown neighborhood of New York. Hanna Griff-Sleven, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event, officiated.
Ms. Byrne-Mitchell (left), 30, is an international grants management associate on the global philanthropy team at J.P. Morgan Chase in New York. She graduated from Brown and is studying for a Master of Public Administration at Baruch College.
Ms. Ettenheim, who is 31 and works in New York, is the manager of client solutions at Curalate, a technology company, where she helps brands sell more effectively online. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., and received a master’s of the arts in museum education from Bank Street College.
She is a daughter of Susan C. Ettenheim and Tim M. Ettenheim of New York.
The brides will be merging their surnames to Byrneheim, a nod to Ms. Byrne-Mitchell’s maternal Irish heritage and Ms. Ettenheim’s paternal German Jewish heritage.
The couple met at the Museum at Eldridge Street, a national landmark, cultural center and synagogue space in New York, where Ms. Byrne-Mitchell was first an intern, and then the director of visitor services and Ms. Ettenheim was the education manager.
