David Byars documents an armed standoff in “No Man’s Land.” And Francis Lee’s debut feature streams on Netflix.
NO MAN’S LAND (2017) 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). When a group of armed protesters took over eastern Oregon’s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in early 2016, they began a weekslong standoff with the federal government that left one rancher dead, and brought heightened nationwide attention to rural landowners’ concerns about property rights. David Byars’s documentary provides an intimate view of the clash through footage taken during the occupation, much of it from within the protesters’ ranks. Mr. Byars mostly avoids commentary, leaving moral conclusions to viewers.
A DANGEROUS SON (2018) 8 p.m. on HBO. Liz Garbus (“The Fourth Estate”) directs this documentary on mental health. It centers on three families with children who have mental illness, following them as they seek treatment — and find that getting appropriate care is harder than they imagined.
SMITHSONIAN TIME CAPSULE: 1968 8 p.m. on Smithsonian. In late December 1968, Apollo 8 left Earth’s atmosphere on its way to orbit the moon. In the nation it left behind, a tumultuous year was ending: The Tet offensive, the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a presidential election were parts of a larger equation that added up to a nation on edge. Like a televised museum exhibition, this special tells the history of 1968 by highlighting objects from significant events of that year.
