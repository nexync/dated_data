Amid growing doubts about whether President Trump will meet with North Koreaâ€™s leader on June 12, Kim Jong-un, the Trump administration came under criticism Tuesday over commemorative coins that were created to honor the planned meeting.
And some noticed what appeared to be a double chin on Mr. Kim.
Mr. Trump is said to be concerned about the risks of going ahead with a meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore on June 12, particularly after North Korea declared last week that it would never trade away its nuclear weapons capability in exchange for economic aid.
