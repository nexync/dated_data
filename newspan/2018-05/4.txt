Mr. Groening and others have been called on in recent months to defend the character, Apu, a thickly accented Kwik-E-Mart owner who has been criticized as racist.
Mr. Groening declined through a Fox spokeswoman to comment further.
Mr. Groening’s comments aligned with the way the show coyly addressed the uproar, in an episode last month that attracted renewed criticism.
Mr. Groening — whose name rhymes with “raining” — was one of the writers on the episode. After it aired, Al Jean, the showrunner since 1998, retweeted posts decrying political correctness.
In an interview, Mr. Shankar said Apu was a “fabricated archetype, and it’s been carved into the American, and really the global, consciousness with blunt force.” The contest is intended to give “Simpsons” writers access to new perspectives in a way that would be a win-win, he said.
He said he was inspired to create the contest — which Kanye West promoted on Twitter — partly by Mr. Groening’s comments.
Mr. Groening came to prominence with a weekly comic strip, “Life in Hell,” that was popular among alternative newspapers and ran from 1978 to 2012. The characters on “The Simpsons” are named after his real-life family: His father, Homer; his mother, Margaret; and his sisters, Maggie and Lisa.
