Dr. Lim said an open question is how astronauts exploring Mars should communicate their findings back to earth despite a one-way communications delay — what she called “planetary latency” — that can be anywhere from four to 22 minutes.
Scientists with the project — which is officially called Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains, or Basalt — say that some of their research for the project will be published later this year in the scientific journal Astrobiology.
The InSight spacecraft is heading to Mars to listen for marsquakes and study the planet’s structure.
Another is a NASA-funded behavioral research study in which teams of people live in isolation for months at a “Mars-like” site on the slope of the Mauna Loa volcano, down the road from Kilauea. The study was partly designed to gauge how humans deal with boredom.
Dr. Rowland said that while no Martian (or, for that matter, lunar) volcanoes are active, Hawaii’s volcanoes are useful to scientists because they have newly formed faults, craters, calderas and other features that can be studied up close.
“Some of the flows on Kilauea are flowing right this very minute, so obviously features can be super-young,” he added.
Dr. Lim said her team was not affected by the recent activity because its fieldwork in the park ended last November. But she plans to return to Hawaii’s Big Island this summer, she said, for a project in which researchers will use a robotic vehicle to explore an underwater seamount, also known as an underwater volcano. The project, which is expected to run through at least 2020, is run partly by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
