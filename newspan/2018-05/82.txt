I was on a crowded subway car in the middle of the day. The doors opened, and an older gentleman got on. He was carrying two heavy bags.
He navigated past several people, and then managed to grip one of the poles. He leaned the bags against his leg.
I kept an eye on him. I was impressed by his masterful display of subway dexterity. I had been trying to eat a bagel and hold on to the pole at the same time. I was failing miserably.
The train began to move. After a moment there was a jolt, and the passengers who were standing were all wrenched to one side. I stumbled and nearly fell, regaining my balance at just the last second.
I turned to make sure the older man was O.K.
He was standing in exactly the same position as he had been before, as immovable as a block of granite. I noticed something else: He had taken out a small pencil and a crumpled piece of paper and was doing a crossword puzzle.
