Jayson Tatum’s go-ahead basket with 22.5 seconds left sent the Boston Celtics back to the Eastern Conference finals with a 114-112 victory over the visiting Philadelphia 76ers in Game 5 of their second-round playoff series Wednesday night.
Tatum had a team-high 25 points, Jaylen Brown scored 24, Terry Rozier added 17 and Al Horford scored 15 for the Celtics, who took a three games-to-none lead in the best-of-seven series before losing, 103-92, in Philadelphia on Monday.
Boston will face the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference finals for the second consecutive season. The Cavaliers, who advanced after sweeping the Toronto Raptors, eliminated the Celtics last May in a five-game series.
Game 1 of Eastern Conference finals will be played Sunday in Boston.
Philadelphia’s Joel Embiid missed a potential game-tying layup with 12.5 seconds left before the 76ers turned the ball over. Boston’s Terry Rozier made two free throws with 9.8 seconds on the clock to make the score 113-109, but a JJ Redick 3-pointer with 3.8 seconds left had the 76ers within a point.
Marcus Smart made one of two free throws with 2.4 seconds left, and Philadelphia turned it over on the inbounds play to seal the outcome.
For the 76ers, Embiid finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds, Dario Saric had a playoff-career-high 27 points and 10 boards, and Ben Simmons totaled 18 points with 8 rebounds and 6 assists.
Philadelphia, which snapped a five-year playoff drought this season, was denied its first trip to the conference finals since going to the N.B.A. finals in the 2000-01 season. No N.B.A. team has overcome an 0-3 series deficit.
At the end of a seesaw first half, Boston scored the last eight points to take a 61-52 lead.
Two Aron Baynes free throws with 6 minutes 4 seconds left in the third quarter gave the Celtics their biggest lead, 12 points, but Philadelphia answered with a 19-8 quarter-ending run to pull to within 83-82 entering the final period.
Robert Covington’s 3-pointer with 9:49 remaining gave the 76ers a 90-88 lead, their first since being up, 48-47, with 3:47 left in the first half. But Boston scored six straight to go ahead, 100-94, on Rozier’s finger roll with 5:27 left.
Saric’s 3-pointer at 3:30 had the 76ers back in front, 103-102, and the Philadelphia lead swelled to 4 points with a minute and a half left. But Smart’s put-back of a Tatum miss tied the score at 109-109 with exactly one minute left.
