CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER at Alice Tully Hall (May 20, 5 p.m.). The Chamber Music Society rounds out its season with a focus on small-scale concertos, including works by Leclair, Bach and Mozart, as well as Janacek’s Concertino and an almost-contemporary work, Steven Mackey’s “Micro-Concerto” for solo percussion and quintet. Instrumentalists include the pianist Anne-Marie McDermott and the percussionist Ayano Kataoka.
FREIBURG BAROQUE ORCHESTRA at Alice Tully Hall (May 19, 7:30 p.m.). This leading period-instrument orchestra delivers classicism in all its glory in this concert, which includes two of Mozart’s finest piano concertos led and played by the fortepianist Kristian Bezuidenhout — the No. 17 in G, K. 453, and the No. 9 in E flat, K. 271. Each concerto is preceded, almost as an overture, by a symphony: Haydn’s No. 74 and Johann Christian Bach’s in G minor.
EVGENY KISSIN at Carnegie Hall (May 20, 2 p.m.). On the evidence of Mr. Kissin’s puzzling, recent Beethoven release on Deutsche Grammophon, and earlier acquaintances with his Beethoven in concert, I would not expect too much from the “Hammerklavier” Sonata on this program, but I would hope for far more from a series of 11 Rachmaninoff preludes, music in which he excels. Encores, as many as a dozen of them, ought to provide some variety from one of the Carnegie audience’s favorite pianists.
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (May 24, 7:30 p.m., through May 26). Semyon Bychkov continues to occupy the Philharmonic’s podium and offers more interesting fare this week than last. He is a good conductor of Strauss, and he has made something of a specialty from “An Alpine Symphony,” which takes up the bulk of this concert. But the real treat is Berio’s “Sinfonia,” performed here with the outstanding vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth.
