New York Today: Why Do New Yorkers Wear Black?
Good morning on this brilliant Tuesday, and welcome to May.
Today you may retire your winter coat.
With bright, sunny skies and temperatures in the mid-70s, and even more heat later this week, you can also feel free to throw on a few bold colors and bright pastels.
Or not. This is New York, so no matter the weather, you’re sure to look stunning in our city’s unofficial uniform: head-to-toe black.
Do New Yorkers actually wear more black?
Yes, said Ms. Steele, but not everyone.
“It’s only some New Yorkers who wear black, but it’s the kind of people popularly identified with this city — fashion people, artists and hipsters,” Ms. Steele said.  At fashion shows, New Yorkers wear black much more often than their counterparts in Paris and Milan do, she said, which has also helped popularize the idea that people from our city wear black.
When did wearing black become our thing?
Artists and cool kids downtown were wearing black for its edgy and sinister vibes, while uptown, Donna Karan was designing with black for its practical applications — the color is flattering, slimming and easy to mix and match.
Why is it we love black so much?
“People dress a certain way because they want to project a particular image of themselves,” Ms. Steele said. Colors help us achieve that.
Plus, we look good in it.
