President Trump is treating the prisoners released by North Korea as heroes. Many of us remember when Mr. Trump declared that Senator John McCain was “not a war hero” because he had been captured after his plane was shot down over North Vietnam.
It looks as if the significant difference for Mr. Trump is not the distinction between political versus combat prisoners, but whether he got to play a role in their release.
