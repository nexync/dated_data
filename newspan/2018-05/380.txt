“Coconut oil and shea butter are good for the elasticity of your skin, and it’s just natural,” McHayle also notes. “It doesn’t irritate me.” She recalls that, when she was a child in East New York, Brooklyn, her mother would make her own coconut oil blend at home. “It has a lot of Omega-3s and fatty acids in it,” she says, “It just makes you look real lush and plump.” For her own hydrating concoction, she mixes in essential oil for a soothing aroma.
· Optional: Swap out lemongrass essential oil for another essential oil, like lavender or sweet orange.
1. Place shea butter, coconut oil and lemongrass essential oil in a bowl.
2. Mix by hand or with a spoon, then apply generously to skin. Makes enough for one use.
