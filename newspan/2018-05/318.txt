The Pulitzer Prize board has opened an independent review of sexual misconduct allegations against the award-winning novelist Junot Díaz, who is stepping down as chairman, the board said on Thursday.
“Mr. Díaz said he welcomed the review and would cooperate fully with it,” the Pulitzer board said in a statement.
Mr. Díaz, who joined the board in 2010, was elevated to chairman last month, according to the organization. It said that Mr. Díaz asked to relinquish his role and that he would remain a part of the body.
Last week the writer Zinzi Clemmons confronted Mr. Díaz at a writers’ festival in Sydney, Australia, asking him why he had treated her the way he had six years earlier, when she was a graduate student at Columbia University. Hours later, Ms. Clemmons accused Mr. Díaz on Twitter of having forcibly kissed her when she was 26.
Since Ms. Clemmons’s accusation, M.I.T., where Mr. Díaz is a writing professor, has begun looking into allegations of sexual misconduct, according to The Associated Press.
The board’s most recent previous chairman, the Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, has resumed the role on an interim basis. Like Mr. Díaz, who is himself a Pulitzer Prize winner for his best-selling first novel, “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao,” Mr. Robinson was elected to the board in 2010.
Others on the board include Stephen Engelberg, editor in chief of ProPublica; Lee C. Bollinger, president of Columbia University; and Nancy Barnes, editor of The Houston Chronicle.
The body’s most high-profile duty is presiding over the judging process by which Pulitzer Prizes are awarded to the year’s best works of reporting, photography, fiction, history, poetry, music and drama.
Neither Mr. Díaz nor his agent immediately responded to emailed requests for comment.
