In a Twitter post early on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he wished he had picked another lawyer to be his attorney general. The president was responding to remarks made earlier by Representative Trey Gowdy, a Republican of South Carolina, on “CBS This Morning.” Mr. Trump quoted him as saying that the president had plenty of good lawyers to choose from when he named his attorney general.
“And I wish I did!” Mr. Trump wrote.
