My friend Adele and I were excited about the possibility of seeing Mikhail Baryshnikov in “Letter to a Man” at the BAM Harvey Theater. Unfortunately, the performances were sold out.
We decided to go to the theater anyway, hoping that tickets might be released before the performance. Some tickets were indeed released while we waited in the packed lobby, but they were too expensive for us.
Fifteen minutes before the performance was to begin, we saw a young man talking to members of the theater staff. Suddenly, he was coming straight toward us.
“I have one ticket left,” he said.
Adele asked how much he wanted.
And so he did. Now we had one ticket.
“Maybe a miracle will happen,” I heard myself saying, not very convincingly.
Five minutes later, a second young man approached us.
I asked how much he wanted.
