Nancy Jean Franks and Benjamin Martinez Newman were married May 15. The Rev. Brian S. Lowery, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony at the Church of San Sigismondo in Gaiole in Chianti, Italy.
The bride, 35, is a marketing manager in New York for PepsiCo. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania and received an M.B.A. from Duke.
She is a daughter of J. Scott Franks of Downingtown, Pa., and the late Maureen Franks. The bride’s father retired as the chairman and chief executive of Tierney Communications, an advertising agency in Philadelphia. Her mother was a substitute teacher at Owen J. Roberts Middle School in Pottstown, Pa., and at Twin Valley Middle School in Elverson, Pa.
The groom, 31, is the executive director for growth services in the New York City Department of Small Business Services. He graduated from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland and received a master’s degree in international affairs from Columbia.
He is the son of Patricia Newman Martinez of Egg by Zurich, Switzerland, and the late David S. Newman. The groom’s mother retired as an English-as-a-second-language coordinator for the primary school of the Inter-Community School Zurich, a private coeducational school in Zumikon, Switzerland. His father was a violinist in the Tonhalle Orchestra in Zurich.
The couple met in 2010 at a bar that neither remembers in New York. They exchanged numbers and soon became friends on Facebook, but when he texted her to see if they might get together, she was always busy. Five years later, he asked again, and this time caught her in the middle of a week off. They met at a bar for drinks, which turned into dinner, and eventually became what they consider to be their first date.
