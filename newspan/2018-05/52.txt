Many may decry the resignation of Eric Schneiderman, New York’s much admired attorney general, on the basis of public condemnation instead of due process through our legal system. The court of public opinion can render verdicts harshly and quickly, and those caught in its glare can be treated unfairly.
But as to Mr. Schneiderman’s alleged behavior, the number of women involved and the manner in which they learned they were not alone in their experiences with a man they believed shared their core values about women’s rights made their stories credible. Such is the power of a free press.
It is terrible to lose a respected public official in this manner, but Mr. Schneiderman was right to recognize that he cannot succeed at his job if he no longer has clear title to the public’s trust.

In the 241 years since New York State inaugurated its first governor in Kingston, N.Y., the Empire State has never had a woman as attorney general. Since 1959, 30 states have appointed or elected women as attorneys general.
In the aftermath of Eric Schneiderman’s resignation, I am hoping that the State Legislature seizes this opportunity to make history with the appointment of a woman from among the numerous highly qualified, experienced prosecutors from across the state to fill the vacancy until the November election.
Recent events and the current political and social environment make it clear that the women of New York State continue to face workplace harassment, domestic violence, inequality in opportunity and pay, and numerous other challenges. The State Legislature has a sudden and unexpected opportunity to make a giant leap toward gender equality.
