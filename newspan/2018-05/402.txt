“The Play That Goes Wrong,” a British farce about an inept theater troupe’s ill-fated effort to stage a murder mystery, will close on Broadway this summer.
The play, which began performances early last year, will play its final performance at the Lyceum Theater on Aug. 26, after 27 previews and 585 regular performances. The show won one Tony Award last year, for best scenic design of a play.
The play’s producers, led by Kevin McCollum and the filmmaker J.J. Abrams, said the comedy would begin a tour after the Broadway closing, starting in Pittsburgh in September.
“The Play That Goes Wrong” was written by Henry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer and Henry Shields of the British company Mischief Theater, and directed by Mark Bell. It has been running in London for four years, and is also on tour in Britain.
The Broadway production was capitalized for up to $4.25 million, and expects to recoup those costs by the end of the Broadway engagement. The play’s weekly grosses have varied, peaking at $707,316 over Christmas week, but dipping to $241,751 during the week ending May 6. In all, it has grossed $22.4 million and has been seen by 321,967 people as of May 6, according to the Broadway League.
