Kyle Korver scored 19 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer in overtime of a game that Cleveland never led in regulation. Tristan Thompson had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who have eliminated Toronto in each of the past two postseasons.
Toronto’s Fred VanVleet missed a 3-pointer with 3.4 seconds to go in overtime that could have won it for the Raptors, who could not manage to hold on to a 14-point, first-quarter lead.
The Cavaliers beat the Raptors in six games in the Eastern Conference finals in 2016 before going on to win their first N.B.A. championship. Last year, Cleveland swept Toronto in the second round.
