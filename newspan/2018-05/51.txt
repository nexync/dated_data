Mr. Khanna, a 41-year-old patent lawyer, is a first-term congressman from the 17th District of California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. He’s a self-avowed tech junkie who’s drawn support from the industry’s top players.
Yet he’s joked that his district has some of “the biggest egos known to humankind” and he is adamant that Silicon Valley is too exclusive, hardly diverse enough and benefits far too few.
Mr. Khanna is the son of immigrants from India. As political inspiration, he cites his grandfather, a member of Mahatma Gandhi’s freedom movement in the 1940s who was jailed for four years before becoming a parliamentarian.
At the University of Chicago, he worked on the State Senate campaign of Barack Obama, and later on Mr. Obama’s presidential run. He moved to California in 2001, and in 2003 ran for Congress.
Mr. Khanna is expected to win re-election on June 5. In its endorsement, The Mercury News praised his “working knowledge” of the tech industry.
