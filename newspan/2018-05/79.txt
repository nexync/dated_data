It’s no surprise that James Comey’s “A Higher Loyalty” entered the best-seller list at No. 1 (May 6). Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” another book that achieved this feat, continues to sell briskly.
It occurs to me that although Barack Obama has been out of office for close to a year and a half — more than enough time for critical tell-all books written by disgruntled White House insiders to show up in bookstores — none has. And it’s not as if such books lack commercial potential. Obama’s presidency just seems to have been a fallow one for inner-circle disgruntlement. Barack Obama was a fine president, but he’s lousy subject matter for disparaging, telltale best-sellerdom. Nobody’s perfect.
Amy Chozick, author of “Chasing Hillary: Ten Years, Two Presidential Campaigns, and One Intact Glass Ceiling,” and Charlotte Alter, who reviewed the book (May 6), admire Hillary Clinton and apparently believe, as I do, that in her presidential campaign, she was the victim of sexism. Yet both Chozick and Alter refer to Clinton by her first name alone — a practice long used to dismiss and infantilize the person being named.
In writing about a man who had served as senator, secretary of state and major party presidential candidate, would either of them identify him by his first name? Would either of them identify the current president as Donald?
I was lucky enough to see both the original production and the 2017 revival, and I also had the privilege of seeing Betty Buckley, Karen Mason, Elaine Paige and Petula Clark play Norma Desmond.
I realize that Close’s singing wasn’t as powerful as it was in 1995. However, her age and maturity elevated her portrayal because it provided a heightened sense of how desperate Desmond was to make her comeback, and also how aware she was that this was her last chance to do so. This made Close’s performance even more poignant and heart-rending than it was in the original production.
