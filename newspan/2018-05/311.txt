Atlantic Theater Company’s new season will include the world premiere of a musical based on the best-selling novel “The Secret Life of Bees” and the American premiere of a family drama starring Isabelle Huppert.
Four of the six slated productions are written by women.
Set in South Carolina in 1964, “The Secret Life of Bees” is a musical adaptation of the novel by Sue Monk Kidd about the relationship between a white teenager and her black caregiver. Lynn Nottage, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “Sweat,” has written the book; Duncan Sheik, who wrote the Tony Award-winning score for “Spring Awakening,” will provide music, and Susan Birkenhead will be the lyricist. It is to begin performances in May 2019 at the Linda Gross Theater, with Sam Gold directing.
Ms. Huppert will appear in Florian Zeller’s “The Mother” next February, in a production directed by Trip Cullman.  Mr. Zeller is a French playwright whose work has been steadily produced in London; Christopher Hampton is the translator.
Mr. Zeller’s “The Father” ran on Broadway in 2016, earning Frank Langella a Tony Award for best actor in the title role.
The Atlantic season will kick off Sept. 26 with Donja R. Love’s “Fireflies,” the story of a black activist couple in the Jim Crow South whose marriage is challenged by a tragedy. Saheem Ali will direct.
Also on the roster: Abby Rosebrock’s “Blue Ridge,” about a high school teacher with an anger problem, which will star Marin Ireland; Amy Staats’s “Eddie and Dave,” the story of an ’80s rock star told from the perspective of an unemployed V.J.; and Carla Ching’s “Nomad Motel,” about two young people in California trying to get by without their absent parents.
