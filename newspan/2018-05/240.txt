Roseanne Barr said she was “Ambien tweeting” when she wrote racist remarks on Twitter that compared a black former Obama administration official to an ape, a comment that led ABC to cancel her television show.
But on Wednesday the makers of Ambien, the sleep aid, were having none of it.
Ms. Barr’s sitcom “Roseanne” returned in March after a two-decade absence on ABC. On Tuesday, the show was canceled after Ms. Barr, its star and co-creator, tweeted if the “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj,” a reference to Valerie Jarrett, an African-American woman who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama.
Ambien is a treatment used for insomnia with a wide range of possible side effects. Some people who use it or similar medications do things while asleep that they don’t remember — such as driving, or preparing and eating food, wrote Dr. Eric Olson of the Mayo Clinic.
In 2012, Zolpidem, the generic form of Ambien, featured in a trial in which Kerry Kennedy, a daughter of Robert F. Kennedy and the former wife of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, was accused of driving under the influence of the drug.
Dr. David Benjamin, a pharmacologist, testified that the drug has the odd effect of impairing a person’s judgment and functioning without that person realizing it. He also said it produced amnesia. In 2014, Ms. Kennedy, who said she took it by accident, was found not guilty.
Dr. W. Christopher Winter of Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine said he had had patients who have said they went to bed in one place and woke up in another; eaten odd foods in the middle of the night only to wake up to the debris; or driven to a fast-food restaurant and tried to order.
