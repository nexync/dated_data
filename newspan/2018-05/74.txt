• The White House brushed aside North Korea’s threats to cancel the summit meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un next month, saying the U.S. was “hopeful” it would happen but would be fine if it did not.
• “We must cast aside illusions and rely on ourselves,” President Xi Jinping of China said last month.
Now, as a top Chinese policymaker meets with the Trump administration this week in hopes of heading off a trade war, Washington and Beijing are anticipating a time when they don’t need each other so much. But both sides acknowledge full disengagement is impossible.
Also this week: Business owners, trade groups and industry representatives will testify before U.S. officials on the administration’s plan to impose tariffs on more than 1,300 Chinese imports such as steel, above.
And we fact-checked President Trump’s assertion that his decision to review restrictions on ZTE, a Chinese telecommunications company, was part of “the larger trade deal.” We also looked at why the U.S. is unnerved by China’s rise.
Israelis grappled with the casualty reports from the Gaza protest on Monday: 60 Palestinians killed and more than 1,700 hospitalized, according to Palestinian officials. Israel justified the use of force, saying some protesters were armed.

The Russia investigation began with a top-secret F.B.I. mission to London to interview the Australian ambassador.
President Trump has dismissed it as a “witch hunt” — but the F.B.I. repeatedly took steps that benefited him.
And a Senate panel released thousands of pages of documents on the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Trump campaign officials and a self-described Kremlin informant.
Also on Wednesday: Mr. Trump released his financial disclosure, which revealed that he paid more than $100,000 to his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, above, for an unspecified reimbursement. Mr. Cohen paid $130,000 to the adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, who claims she had an affair with Mr. Trump.
• A remote town in northeastern China has long cherished its special, if fraught, connection to Japan.
Fangzheng was once part of the Japanese imperial puppet state Manchuria, and the Sino-Japanese Friendship Garden there, above, holds the graves of 5,000 Japanese who died when Soviet forces swept in during World War II.
But the town, like its cemetery, has been caught in the complex and tortured history that still divides Japan and China. In 2011, nationalists shut down the garden and branded the residents, many of whom have family ties to Japan, as traitors.
Now, warming relations between Tokyo and Beijing have given some hope. “It’s torture for people like me who love both countries,” one resident said.

Just after the “Seinfeld” finale began, on May 14, 1998, a 911 call came from Frank Sinatra’s home in Beverly Hills.
The singer’s daughter Nancy, above, lived five blocks away and, like more than 76 million other people, she was watching the NBC sitcom end after nine seasons. She told “Entertainment Tonight” that she’d planned on visiting her father but didn’t because she was engrossed in the farewell to Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer.
“Seinfeld” owned the 9 p.m. slot for NBC. The call to 911 was answered at 9:14 p.m., The New York Daily News reported, and an ambulance arrived in just four minutes. The streets of Los Angeles were nearly empty thanks to the show’s popularity, the fire department said.
Ms. Sinatra’s stepmother, Barbara, was with her father at the hospital but, Nancy Sinatra said, nobody called her until after he died, causing a rift in the family.
