MARVEL’S AGENTS OF S.H.I.E.L.D. 9 p.m. on ABC. With the heroes of “Avengers: Infinity War” still fighting off villains on the big screen, smaller screens will see the fifth season of Marvel’s ABC series come to an end tonight. Season 5 of the series, which set Season 1 in the aftermath of the first “Avengers” movie, has continued to explore S.H.I.E.L.D., a clandestine government agency that operates in the same fantastical universe as other Marvel fare. The Season 5 finale, “The End,” will, thankfully for Marvel enthusiasts, not be the end of the show; the series was renewed for a sixth season, slated for 2019.
