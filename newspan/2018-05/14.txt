I am deeply saddened to learn of Philip Rothâ€™s death.
He was a stunning writer who had the ability to pierce the heart, make one laugh, move one to tears. The depth of his craftsmanship and imagination was magnificent. I have read all of his works, and they remain indelible; some of his books sustained me during some difficult times.
The beauty, humor and profound truth of his sentences, and his observations about the human condition, particularly about the losses one sustains as one ages, are beyond price. He should have won the Nobel Prize, but that is beside the point.
He was a great American artist, and he was also a champion of world literature.
A few years ago, upon reading of his decision to retire from writing, I summoned the courage to write to him and tell him how much his work meant to me. He took the time to write me a gracious, handwritten thank-you note; it is on my desk and I treasure it.
Thank you, Mr. Roth, for your genius, and for your humanity.
