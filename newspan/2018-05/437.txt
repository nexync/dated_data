The comedian Michelle Wolf has worked on both “The Daily Show” and “Late Night,” so Trevor Noah and Seth Meyers were not surprised by the rough-riding, profane speech she gave at the White House correspondents’ dinner on Saturday.
The speech has drawn criticism for its unapologetic attacks on President Trump and, in particular, jokes involving Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s makeup (Wolf said her eye shadow was made of “burnt facts”).
Noah and Meyers saw little cause for outrage — especially given Trump’s own history of commenting crudely on women’s appearances — and they swept to Ms. Wolf’s defense on Monday.
Meyers was especially bothered by the fact that the White House Correspondents’ Association, which hired Wolf for the evening, put out a statement denouncing Wolf. It said her statements were “not in the spirit” of the event.
On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert recalled hosting the correspondents’ dinner in 2006, when he told intensely sharp-edged jokes at President George W. Bush’s expense.
Colbert got back into the character that he used to play back then — an over-the-top conservative commentator — and opined about Wolf’s performance on Saturday.
These records are atrocious.
