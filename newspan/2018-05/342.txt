“After Hours” appeared amid a cycle of films known as comedies of yuppie angst, among them Albert Brooks’s “Lost in America,” Susan Seidelman’s “Desperately Seeking Susan,” and Jonathan Demme’s “Something Wild.” All concern staidly settled characters who suffer identity crises and worse upon leaving their socio-economic comfort zones.
Mr. Scorsese’s contribution is notable for exuding a sinister quality akin to the Weimar antecedents of film noir. In “After Hours,” a proper bourgeois, tempted by a femme fatale, finds himself caught in an urban vortex. The script, by a Columbia student, Joseph Minion, apparently borrowed elements of a 1982 monologue about a hookup gone awry by the radio storyteller Joe Frank, but the pervasive atmosphere of sexual guilt is characteristic of Mr. Scorsese’s work.
Women are not the sole source of Paul’s travails.  References to the works of Franz Kafka are both subtle and overt, although it would seem Henry Miller is the cause of Paul’s nightmare.
In addition to its cast, “After Hours” is distinguished by its locations. Most of the movie is shot on the streets of SoHo, a neighborhood made to seem a dangerous, deserted labyrinth. As a resident who had lived there long enough to see the factories leave and the yuppies arrive, I found “After Hours” seriously anachronistic back in 1985, complaining in The Village Voice that it really should have been set in Williamsburg or Dumbo.
Revisiting “After Hours,” three decades later, I was impressed by how fondly Mr. Scorsese and the cinematographer Michael Ballhaus captured SoHo’s nocturnal desolation. Along with the movie’s Checker cabs, rotary phones, outsized answering machines and clunky desktop computers, these mean streets have a Pompeian quality, relics of the past.
