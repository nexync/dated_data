Kelly Clarkson said she was supposed to lead a moment of silence on Sunday night as she hosted the Billboard Music Awards in the aftermath of yet another school shooting — this one at Santa Fe High School in Texas, which killed 10 people.
But she had something else in mind.
She didn’t mention exactly what action she meant, nor did she specify that she was in favor of limiting access to guns. But it was a notable statement. Ms. Clarkson is a gun owner herself and has spoken publicly about it several times. She told NPR in 2012 that she owned nine guns and that she slept with a Colt .45.
Ms. Clarkson is also a Texas native, having been born in Fort Worth, and lives outside Nashville, Tenn. Still, Ms. Clarkson’s impromptu speech may not make much difference in Texas, a conservative state where gun rights are considered sacred by many. She has not hesitated to discuss her politics in the past, having called for the legalization of marijuana and endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in 2015.
Billboard did not seem to have an issue with Ms. Clarkson’s going off script, as it posted video of her monologue on social media. The awards show returned to the subject of school shootings when the singers Shawn Mendes and Khalid were joined on stage by a choir from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 people in February.
But it was Ms. Clarkson’s speech that generated the most buzz from the night.
