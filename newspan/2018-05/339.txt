About a quarter of New York City speaks Spanish, but one man did not want to hear it from the staff making his lunch at a Midtown Manhattan spot on Tuesday. 
Even the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, known as ICE, distanced itself from the man’s threat to call the office. But a spokeswoman acknowledged that all undocumented immigrants are subject to deportation.
“ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Tip Line is solely for the purposes of making legitimate reports of suspected criminal activity. The Tip Line should not be used as an instrument to intimidate or harass,” said Rachael Yong Yow, the spokeswoman for the New York field office of ICE.
Some social media users said they knew the man in the video’s identity, though The Times was unable to immediately confirm it. He was said to be a lawyer who founded his own firm, but he did not respond to a call and email seeking comment. At the office of the firm identified on social media, an administrator firmly asked a reporter to leave because it was private property. The firm’s website advertises services in Spanish, French, Chinese and Hebrew.
Last year, Thomas D. Homan, the acting director of ICE, warned anyone living in the country illegally that they were deportable: “You should look over your shoulder,” he said.
Across the country, ICE increased arrests domestically in 2017 by 41 percent. In New York, since Mr. Trump took office in 2017, the immigration arrests of undocumented people without criminal records has more than tripled.
Juan Cartagena, the President of LatinoJustice PRLDEF, a civil rights advocacy group, was outraged that the man in the video assumed that because people speak Spanish they are not citizens.
“There is alignment here between what this person thinks ICE can do and what ICE has been doing,” Mr. Cartagena said.
