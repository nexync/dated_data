• Washington will reimpose stringent sanctions on Tehran that it had waived as part of the 2015 nuclear accord, after President Trump announced on Tuesday that he was withdrawing the U.S. from the seven-country agreement.
The president’s decision unravels Barack Obama’s signature foreign policy achievement, just weeks before a nuclear negotiation with North Korea. It’s also a bet that the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East — namely Israel and Saudi Arabia — can force a better deal with Iran through isolation and sanctions.
Our correspondent offers the view from Iran, which said it would remain in the deal, as did Britain, France and Germany. Here’s where the agreement stands.
• Mr. Trump’s decision could be the start of a period in which he finally puts in place the “America First” approach he has long promised. Our chief White House correspondent explains.
• Pyongyang freed three American prisoners today, removing a bitterly emotional obstacle ahead of a planned summit meeting between President Trump and the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.
• Financial records reviewed by The Times show that President Trump’s personal lawyer used a shell company for an array of business activities.
More than $4 million in transactions flowed through the company, Essential Consultants, starting shortly before Mr. Trump was elected president and continuing to this past January, the records show.
• Among the payments were more than $1 million from an American company linked to a Russian oligarch, as well as money from several corporations with business before the Trump administration. AT&T, whose proposed merger with Time Warner is pending before the Justice Department, made four payments totaling $200,000.
• The establishment wing of both parties fended off challenges in primary elections on Tuesday.
In West Virginia, the coal baron Don Blankenship was soundly defeated in a Senate primary after President Trump and other Republican leaders urged voters to reject him.

• And Greg Pence won the Republican primary in Indiana for the House seat once held by his brother, Vice President Mike Pence. Here are all of last night’s results, as well as six takeaways from Tuesday’s voting.
• Eric Schneiderman, the former attorney general of New York, had held himself up as a one-man legal wrecking ball, taking on President Trump’s agenda in the courts and in the court of public opinion.
But Mr. Schneiderman’s sudden resignation after four women accused him of physical assault has raised questions about what will happen to the Democratic legal resistance. Another question is who will replace him.
• Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked Tuesday night that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate the allegations against Mr. Schneiderman.
• Gina Haspel, the nominee for C.I.A. director, will go before the Senate Intelligence Committee today, starting at 9:30 a.m. Eastern. Here’s what to watch for.
She is expected to face questions about her oversight of the torture of a terrorism suspect at a secret prison in Thailand and her advocacy for destroying documentation of brutal interrogations.
• One subject of those interrogations was Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the principal architect of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In a twist, he has asked to share unspecified information about Ms. Haspel with lawmakers.
President Trump has pulled the United States from the nuclear agreement, calling it “decaying and rotten.” Why did President Barack Obama join it in the first place?

In an opinion column, Bari Weiss writes about a collection of iconoclastic thinkers, academic renegades and media personalities “who are having a rolling conversation — on podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, and in sold-out auditoriums — that sound unlike anything else happening, at least publicly, in the culture right now.” Should we be listening?

The author J.M. Barrie, who was born on this day in 1860, donated the rights to his most famous creation to the Great Ormond Street children’s hospital in London in 1929. In a front-page report at the time, The New York Times estimated their worth at “roughly $10,000 a year,” which it said was equivalent to a sixth of the hospital’s income.
It would have been clear that the gift was of lasting value: The boy who never grows up was introduced in 1902, becoming the subject of a hit play two years later, and then a novel. He had already inspired a statue in a London park, and even begun his long career in movies.
But few would have guessed quite how long Peter Pan would pay. The copyright first expired in Britain at the end of 1987, 50 years after Barrie’s death. Within months, however, Parliament passed a measure granting Great Ormond Street a permanent right to royalties from the stage play and adaptations of it.
Peter Pan’s adventures in America are also helping the hospital; according to its website, the U.S. copyright does not expire until 2023.
