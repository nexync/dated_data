A question from Benje Choucroun, 13, about the Trump administration’s response to school shootings appeared to affect the White House press secretary.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, audibly choked up during Wednesday’s press briefing as she answered a student’s question about school shootings.
The student, Benje Choucroun, 13, was at the White House covering a children’s fitness event for Time for Kids, but was called on as he sat among the White House press corps. He said his school recently had a lockdown drill.
President Trump has called for action after some high-profile school shootings, but little has come of it beyond the creation of the commission, which is overseen by Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.
After a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., killed 17 people in February, Mr. Trump said he would look at stricter background checks and raising the minimum age for buying assault weapons. He also suggested arming teachers, giving them a bonus to carry guns.
Those proposals have gone nowhere. He later said on Twitter that there was “not much political support (to put it mildly)” on raising the minimum age.
In the only tangible action, Attorney General Jeff Sessions introduced regulations in March to ban so-called bump stocks, a device used in last year’s massacre in Las Vegas. But the ban has not gone into effect and could still face legal challenges from gun rights groups.
