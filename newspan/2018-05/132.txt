Politics|Did Trump Fire Comey Over the Russia Inquiry or Not?
President Trump and his aides have offered a number of reasons — including relief from the investigation into Russian election meddling — for why he fired James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.
Mr. Trump and his aides have given a number of conflicting reasons — sometimes within hours of each other or even in the same interview — for why he fired Mr. Comey from his position as F.B.I. director on May 9, 2017. At the time, Mr. Comey was leading the investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign had coordinated with Russian election meddling.
Initially, the White House cited a recommendation from Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who criticized Mr. Comey’s handling of the conclusion of a separate investigation into whether Hillary Clinton mishandled classified emails.
On May 10, 2017, Mr. Trump informed Russian officials in an Oval Office meeting that he had fired Mr. Comey. “I faced great pressure because of Russia. That’s taken off,” Mr. Trump told the Russians, as The New York Times has reported.
A few months later, Mr. Trump again said he would have fired Mr. Comey regardless of Mr. Rosenstein’s recommendation. “Now, perhaps I would have fired Comey anyway, and it certainly didn’t hurt to have the letter, O.K. But he gives me a very strong letter, and now he’s involved in the case,” the president said in a July 2017 interview with The Times.
Mr. Trump’s aides also have given conflicting reasons for Mr. Comey’s firing.
The president’s Thursday tweet follows a report published on Wednesday in The Times, about an F.B.I. memo outlining the conversations that led to Mr. Comey’s firing. That memo was written by Andrew G. McCabe, who became acting director of the F.B.I. after Mr. Comey was dismissed.
Mr. McCabe was fired in March from the F.B.I., where he had most recently served as deputy director.
