President Trump on Wednesday characterized his decision to review restrictions on a Chinese telecommunication company as part of “the larger trade deal.” But his commerce secretary and press aides have said differently.
This contradicts other administration officials.
In an earlier Twitter post, on Sunday, President Trump announced that he was considering easing restrictions on ZTE, a major Chinese telecommunications company.
The restrictions — which block ZTE for seven years from using components made in the United States — were imposed last month by Mr. Trump’s Commerce Department. The company has long been considered a threat to American national security: ZTE agreed to pay $1.19 billion last year in fines for violating sanctions and selling electronics to Iran and North Korea.
But his top economic aides have maintained that any decision on ZTE should not be linked to trade talks.
Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump’s top economic adviser, echoed that sentiment in a Tuesday interview with Axios.
“This is principally an enforcement issue, by the way. It’s really divorced from the trade story,” Mr. Kudlow said, according to Reuters.
Raj Shah, a White House deputy press secretary, was asked on Monday whether the White House agreed with Mr. Ross that whatever might happen with ZTE had nothing to do with trade negotiations.
