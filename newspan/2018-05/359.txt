In July 2013, the pope responded to questions about a supposed “gay lobby” in the Vatican by saying “Who am I to judge,” a remark that caused celebration among liberals and consternation among conservatives. His reported remarks to Mr. Cruz added to the debate over whether Francis believes homosexuality is a choice.
Archbishop Matteo Maria Zuppi of Bologna, sometimes called the “Bergoglio of Italy” for his similarity to Francis, the former Jorge Mario Bergoglio, published on Monday a preface to the Italian version of “Building a Bridge,” a book by the American Jesuit priest James Martin about reaching out to gay Catholics.
He announced on Saturday that Óscar Romero, a Salvadoran bishop shot and killed by right-wing forces for preaching against military oppression and American meddling, would be canonized in October.
The next day, he reshaped the College of Cardinals, which will choose his successor. He surprisingly named 14 new cardinals, 11 of whom are under 80 and thus able to vote in the next conclave.
After the appointment in June of the new cardinals, who come from across the world, Francis will have named 59, or nearly half of the 125 voting cardinals. Pope Benedict XVI, a conservative who retired in 2013, named 47 of the remaining electors. And Pope John Paul II, also a conservative, elevated 19.
Francis’ meeting with the bishops followed his personal meetings two weeks ago with the survivors of abuse whom he had previously accused of slander. According to Mr. Cruz, Francis was decidedly on the side of the victims and entirely welcoming of the Chilean’s sexual orientation.
Mr. Cruz said that his lawyer warned him in 2009 that the church would focus on his homosexuality, leaving him vulnerable and threatening to make life extremely difficult for him.
It was then that the pope reassured him, he said. The two went on to chat about Mr. Cruz’s personal life, his not having a partner, and his relationship with his family.
