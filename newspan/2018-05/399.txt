• North Korea’s top nuclear weapons negotiator, Kim Yong-chol, above, was heading to New York on Tuesday, President Trump said. Mr. Kim, one of the most trusted aides to the North’s leader and a former intelligence chief, was due to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
American and North Korean officials have been trying to salvage a proposed June 12 summit meeting that Mr. Trump canceled last week.
The U.S. is hoping to start talks with North Korea on “rapid denuclearization,” but a top government adviser and former director of the Los Alamos weapons laboratory says the process could take up to 15 years.
That time frame stands in stark contrast with what the U.S. has demanded, and the issue could become a sticking point in any meeting between Mr. Trump and the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.
• The Trump administration said it would proceed with a series of punitive trade-related measures on China next month, increasing pressure on Beijing to make concessions. The plan is to levy 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports. A list of products affected will be released by June 15, officials said.
Trade talks will continue, but the U.S. has asked China to remove “all of its many trade barriers” that prevent U.S. companies from doing business in China.

• Did the U.S. government separate 1,500 immigrant children from their parents and then lose track of them?
There’s been a lot of misinformation, fueled by social media and President Trump’s false claim that Democrats were responsible for a “horrible law” separating the children at the border. Here are the facts about what happened, and what the administration’s policies are.

• Pakistan has a new caretaker prime minister: Nasir ul-Mulk, a former Supreme Court chief justice who will lead a nonpartisan interim government through general elections in July. His main challenge will be to ensure a free and fair vote amid heightened tensions between leading politicians as the country, prone to coups, aims to make its second democratic transition.
Pakistan’s former spy chief, Asad Durrani, wrote a book with his Indian counterpart to encourage dialogue between the two countries. Instead, Pakistan’s military barred him from leaving the country and opened an investigation into whether he violated the military’s code of conduct.
And a heat wave has scorched the port city of Karachi, above, where temperatures soared above 110 degrees Fahrenheit last week, days after the beginning of Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting. The timing has exacerbated the effects of the brutal heat, which has killed at least 65 people.
• Nine months after liberation from the Islamic State, Mosul is coming back to life. New businesses are opening, students gather at the university, and people stay out late for the first time in years.
But farther west, in the Old City, reminders of the war are still evident: destroyed vehicles, piles of rubble.
“We often think about this, how everything has changed and now everything is as if nothing happened at all,” a soldier said.
The aftermath of the Islamic State is full of hope. Will that last?
• Paper and plastic recyclables from dozens of American cities are being dumped in local landfills after China stopped recycling most “foreign garbage.” And the European Union is considering a ban on plastic items like straws to curb marine pollution.

Spelling may be in trouble in the era of “covfefe.” But it’s serious business at this week’s Scripps National Spelling Bee near Washington, with ESPN coverage and $40,000 for the winner.
It’s a far cry from 1925, when Frank Neuhauser got $500 in gold as the bee’s first winner. He had to spell his winning word, “gladiolus,” for strangers for the rest of his life.
Last year’s winner was Ananya Vinay, who won with “marocain.” Although she isn’t allowed to compete in this year’s national bee, she’s still spelling and coaching others.
Texas is the state with the most winners, 11. Twenty-two states have had none. Spellers from other countries can compete, and the first international winner was Jody-Anne Maxwell of Jamaica in 1998, above, with “chiaroscurist.” There are spellers from five countries other than the U.S. this year.
The longest winning word was “scherenschnitte,” spelled by Vanya Shivashankar, who was a co-champion in 2015. The shortest was “luge,” which won Daniel Greenblatt the title in 1984.
In 1983, a child who lost made news. Andrew Flosdorf was praised “for his utter honesty” after telling the judges they misheard him when they said he spelled “echolalia” correctly. “I didn’t want to feel like a slime,” he said.
