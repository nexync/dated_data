The A.A.M.D. said that the sanctions would be effective immediately, and they would include a request that each of the association’s 243 members refrain from lending works to the Berkshire Museum or collaborating with it on exhibitions.
A spokeswoman for the Berkshire Museum, Carol Bosco Baumann, called the sanctions regrettable.
The museum, in Pittsfield, Mass., sparked a widespread debate and drew vehement objections last summer when it announced plans to sell 40 pieces by artists like Norman Rockwell, Albert Bierstadt and Alexander Calder and use the proceeds to increase its endowment, renovate its building and expand programming.
Museum officials said revenue from sales was vital to the institution’s survival. Among those who criticized the plans were museum members and descendants of Rockwell. The A.A.M.D., whose code of ethics says that artworks should be sold only in specific circumstances to add new works, condemned the planned sale in a letter with another organization, the American Alliance of Museums.
After lawsuits and conflicting court rulings, the Massachusetts attorney general’s office, which has oversight of nonprofit organizations, agreed in February on a framework for the museum to sell as many as 40 works to raise up to $55 million.
Thirteen works, including Rockwell’s “Blacksmith’s Boy — Heel and Toe” and Frederic Edwin Church’s “Valley of Santa Isabel, New Granada,” were offered for sale this month by Sotheby’s. The sales brought net proceeds of $42 million to the museum, it said.
The A.A.M.D. also announced that it would sanction the La Salle University Art Museum in Philadelphia, which recently sold works to raise money for the school.
