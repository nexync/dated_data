• A Palestinian protest on the Gaza border with Israel took a violent turn as Israeli forces killed at least 52 Palestinians and wounded 2,400 others, Gaza officials said. The Israeli military said some protesters tried to swarm the fence or hurled explosives. Our live briefing has the latest.
Barely 40 miles away, in Jerusalem, Ivanka Trump and other American officials celebrated President Trump’s formal relocation of the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv. It was a surreal contrast of pomp and chaos between the two sites.
Today, on the 70th anniversary of its declaration of independence, Israel has arguably never been more powerful, militarily or economically. But it remains estranged from its Arab neighbors, with a prime minister ensnared in corruption scandals and a future wrapped in uncertainty.
• After weeks of threats, President Trump is easing up on China.
To avert a trade war, he’s heeding more moderate economic advisers and offering to save the Chinese telecom giant ZTE from implosion under U.S. sanctions. In return, he wants China to agree to buy more American products and lift restrictions on American agriculture.
The offer could reduce pressure as the U.S. and China go toe-to-toe on trade.
But pardoning a company that allegedly violated American trade controls on Iran and North Korea could also set a difficult precedent ahead of Mr. Trump’s meeting next month with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un. Here’s more about ZTE and the penalties it faces.
And even as the U.S. demands nuclear disarmament abroad, it is rejuvenating and expanding its own nuclear capacity — reviving, in the process, fears of doomsday.
• Fake news is becoming a problem worldwide in elections, and not just via Facebook.
In India, where WhatsApp has 250 million users, the messaging service is becoming central to electioneering — and a prime vector for dangerous misinformation.
A youth leader for the governing Bharatiya Janata Party told us he used WhatsApp to stay in touch with voters he was assigned to track in his state. He sends his group critiques of the opposition as well as dark (and patently false) propaganda about Hindus being murdered by Muslims. Above, a spurious poll that circulated.
Indonesian authorities condemned a wave of suicide bombings that apparently involved entire families. On Monday, a family of five detonated a bomb at the police headquarters in Surabaya. An 8-year-old girl with them survived.
On Sunday, a single family carried out three bombings targeting Christian worshipers in the city, officials said. In a separate incident, a family of three, including a child, were killed in an explosion at their apartment as the police closed in.
Bolstering the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility, the authorities said the bombs were similar to those used by the group in the Mideast. One of the families had recently returned from Syria.
• A news blackout for a cardinal?
Australian prosecutors applied for a “super injunction” against news coverage of the two planned trials of Cardinal George Pell, above, the highest-ranking Catholic official yet to be charged in connection with child sexual abuse. A ruling is expected tomorrow.
Experts say it is an extreme measure, intended to shield jurors from potential bias. Details of the accusations and number of charges are already secret under similar restrictions.
The cardinal, a climate change denialist, dined in June with Scott Pruitt, the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in a meeting omitted from Mr. Pruitt’s calendar.
• The U.S. government has been deluged by 8,200 exemption requests from U.S. companies affected by the Trump administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum.
• South Koreans are buying up land near and even inside the Demilitarized Zone, despite land mines, in anticipation of peace.
• Xerox called off its merger with Fujifilm of Japan after opposition from shareholder activist Carl Icahn and another major investor.
• China is working on the world’s largest amphibious plane, about as big as a Boeing 737.
• Closing the gender pay gap: British companies that are now required to publish salary differences between men and women are trying various programs to close the divide.
• U.S. stocks were slightly up. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.

• “Little Tokyo on the Rhine”: A neighborhood in Düsseldorf, Germany, has one of the largest Japanese populations in Europe, and cuisine to match.
• Australian readers wrote to express gratitude for their student-loan system, under which default is rare, and offered sympathy to their debt-saddled American counterparts.
“Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada” reads the sign, but Sin City wasn’t always known as the home of extravagance and gambling.
Las Vegas (“The Meadows”) was officially founded on this day in 1905, although people had settled there long before. Its only draw at the time was as a railroad town.
Six years later, The Times reported on a proposal that would have established a “divorce colony” in “a town hitherto devoid of large fame.” It was the start of a long history of reinvention, which its casinos and hotels continue today.
With Nevada’s liberal laws, the city started offering “quickie divorces” in 1931. Despite its history as an easy place to end a marriage, Las Vegas remains equally popular for starting one: Clark County, which includes the city, issued more than 78,000 marriage licenses last year.
The city attracts more than 42 million visitors annually and is home to some of the largest hotels in the world: The Venetian and MGM Grand occupy the No. 2 and 3 spots in the current rankings.
Las Vegas has grown so much in 113 years that its attractions can be seen even from space: Astronauts on the International Space Station have labeled the Vegas Strip the brightest spot on Earth.
