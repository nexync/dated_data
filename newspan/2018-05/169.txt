SEOUL, South Korea — Hours after President Trump canceled a summit with its leader, Kim Jong-un, North Korea said on Friday that it was still willing to give Mr. Trump “time and opportunity” to reconsider his decision, saying that Mr. Kim had held great expectations for the meeting.
With its carefully worded statement, North Korea appeared to shift the blame to the United States while trying to create an impression that it was the North Korean leader, and not Mr. Trump, who was the mature statesman trying to salvage the diplomatic process.
Mr. Trump, in a surprise announcement, said Thursday that he was pulling out of the June 12 summit meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore. The American president cited North Korea’s recent expressions of hostility in making his decision, which was delivered to the North’s leader in a letter.
“This unfortunate turn of event shows how serious is the deep-rooted problem between North Korea and the United States and why a summit meeting is so urgently needed,” the vice foreign minister said. But now North Korea, he said, was left wondering whether Mr. Trump “lacked a will or self-confidence” to deal with the North Koreans.
