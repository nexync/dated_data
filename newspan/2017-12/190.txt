Like “Blind Spot: Hitler’s Secretary,” which centered on the recollections of Traudl Junge, “A German Life” lets viewers consider its subject — her anecdotes, body language and face (often shot in close-up) — and decide how much to believe her. The words of Ms. Pomsel, who is remarkably lucid for a centenarian, are intercut with quotations from Goebbels and archival footage from both sides of the war. Viewers are implicitly invited to ponder the contrast.
“I’m not the kind of person to resist,” she says at one point, adding, “I’m one of the cowards.” Noting that nobody believes her, she says she only learned about “the matter of the Jews” when she returned from Russian prison camps after the war. Yet one of the recurring characters in her stories is a Jewish friend, Eva Löwenthal, whom records indicate was deported to Auschwitz and, in 1945, declared dead.
