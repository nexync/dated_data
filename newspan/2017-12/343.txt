Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine, hasn’t had the greatest few days. She provided a crucial vote for the tax bill in exchange for some promises from her Republican colleagues that they now will likely not keep.
My column today looks at the mistake she made. Above all, I think she has defined centrism in relative terms rather than substantive terms. She is chasing President Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress even as they move far to the right.
The dilemma she faces is one that just about every centrist Republican will face at some point during the Trump era. I hope others learn from Collins’s struggles. It’s best to define centrism on substantive grounds, not merely political ones.
