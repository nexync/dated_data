Tigers are particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because they require expansive territories for hunting.The researchers estimated the Sumatran tiger’s home range to be about 150 miles, which is large even by tiger standards. “These tigers cover an insane amount of area every day,” Dr. Luskin said.
Trap cameras offer intimate glimpses into the secretive lives of wildlife, including lions roaming the wetlands of Namibia and coyotes dwelling in the forests of North Carolina.
In 2014, as a graduate student with the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Luskin mounted close to 300 motion-activated cameras throughout Sumatran forests, then used the tigers’ distinct markings to track individuals. He found that the concentration of tigers outside the protected parks was 70 percent lower than in the protected areas. He also found that density varied considerably from park to park, suggesting some parks are better than others at keeping out poachers.
But Dr. Luskin couldn’t draw conclusions about changes in tiger density over time with only a single year of data. And data from previous studies had to be recalculated in order to standardize estimates of tiger density.
That effort showed that overall tiger density had decreased by 17 percent from 2000 to 2012, even as density in the protected forests was inching upward. And because the overall decline is driven by loss of habitat, some of the growth in the parks is probably just tigers fleeing the forest. “When you cut down forest, the tigers all move inward,” said Dr. Luskin.
