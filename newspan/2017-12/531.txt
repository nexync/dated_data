• The White House is whipsawing between scandal and success.
President Trump made an extraordinary attack on the F.B.I., lashing out after the special counsel’s investigation into Russian election meddling secured the cooperation of Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn.
The president’s inner circle is now under heightened scrutiny, and new evidence that multiple campaign officials knew of Mr. Flynn’s pre-inauguration contacts with Russia has emerged.
The developments cast a shadow over Mr. Trump’s first major legislative victory: Senate passage of the largest tax cut in years, which lawmakers appear ready to send rapidly forward for the president’s signature.
• China’s hugely influential but little-seen Communist Party theoretician, Wang Huning, stepped out of the shadows with a call for security and order on the internet.
Delivering his first speech since joining the Politburo Standing Committee at a conference created to showcase the country’s technological strengths, Mr. Wang outlined an authoritarian future for China’s cyberspace before an audience that included Tim Cook of Apple and Jack Ma of Alibaba.
“Global cyberspace governance has no onlookers — we are all participants,” Mr. Wang said, adding that “all parties” should have a say over how the internet is managed across the world.
He argued that his caution enabled him to have a private meeting with Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the architect of the brutal campaign against the Rohingya, and make it clear that the horrors of the past were no longer viable. Above, a Rohingya woman and child returning to a camp for the displaced.
• In Australia, contrasting assessments from the Turnbull government and the prominent defense strategist Hugh White have set off a raging debate over whether China has already displaced the U.S. in the region.
Two main factors have shaken Australia: China’s assertive behavior in the South China Sea, and President Trump’s abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade deal meant to counterbalance China’s economic might.
• Canada appears ready to take up the role the newly protectionist U.S. is abandoning, that of global champion of free trade. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, is in China for a five-day trip focused on expanding trade.
He meets today with the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, and will also meet with President Xi Jinping — even as Canada seeks to revive the T.P.P.

Voting ends today for the readers’ choice of Time Magazine’s “Person of the Year,” with the winner announced on Wednesday.
While the selection has been criticized as non-news, it is already getting attention from last year’s recipient, Donald Trump, who was then the U.S. president-elect.
If it is Mr. Trump, he would be the second person to be named for two consecutive years. The other was Richard Nixon, who was named in 1971 and 1972, when he shared the honor with Henry Kissinger.
The decision is based on impact, rather than good deeds. Previous selections have included Hitler and Stalin.
Most recipients have been white men, starting with the first, the American aviator Charles Lindbergh, in 1927. In 2015, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, became only the fourth woman to be named on her own.
The computer won the title in 1982, and Earth was picked in 1988.
In 2006, the traditional cover photo of the winner was replaced by a reflective panel, honoring “You” and the online contributions of millions of internet users.
