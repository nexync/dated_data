Ringo Starr has been named a knight. The Beatles drummer was selected for knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in her 2018 New Year’s Honors list, along with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees and the author Michael Morpurgo. The ballet dancer Darcey Bussell has been named a dame.
Mr. Starr, 77, receives the honor two decades after his fellow bandmate Paul McCartney. Mr. McCartney congratulated Mr. Starr in an Instagram post: “Sir Richard Starkey has a nice ring to it,” he wrote.
Mr. Gibb, 71, dedicated his knighthood to his two late brothers and bandmates, Maurice and Robin. “This is a moment in life to be treasured and never forgotten. I want to acknowledge how responsible my brothers are for this honor,” he said in a statement.
Recipients will be celebrated at an upcoming ceremony led by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.
