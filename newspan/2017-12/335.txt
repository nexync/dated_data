• The U.S. Senate passed the Republicans’ sweeping $1.5 trillion tax bill. The House had already approved it, but the chamber will have to vote again because some of the bill’s provisions violated Senate rules.
Here’s a look at what’s in the final bill, including provisions to tax corporations that operate internationally only on domestic profits. If you pay U.S. taxes, here’s our interactive calculator to help you figure out whether your bill is likely to go up or down.
In many ways, the bill represents a political and economic gamble for Republicans. A majority of Americans oppose it, and relatively few believe they will benefit personally from it, polls show.

Eighteen years ago today, Portugal handed Macau back to China after ruling it as a colony for 442 years. The move came two years after Britain handed back Hong Kong, making Macau the last European colony in Asia.
Portugal had initially offered to return the territory in the 1970s, but China’s leaders demurred because they feared losing a trading link to the outside world, The Times reported on the eve of the 1999 handover.
“Since then, the Portuguese administration has presided over Macau’s steady deterioration into a disreputable, vaguely sinister gambling destination for weekend wagerers from Hong Kong,” the Times story said.
The territory, which is about 40 miles west of Hong Kong, has a population of roughly 650,000.
A different kind of milestone was reached less than a decade after the handover, when Macau overtook Las Vegas to become the world’s biggest gambling center, with $6.95 billion in annual revenue.
“Where Macau was once derided for its seedy gambling dens and endemic organized crime, it is now being referred to as Asia’s Las Vegas, and not just by the locals,” The Times reported in 2007.
