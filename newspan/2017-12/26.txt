The size of that detonation on Sept. 3, which the North claimed was produced by a hydrogen bomb, raised fears of a possible escape of radioactive material into the environment.
Those fears were compounded by a series of small earthquakes reported from Kilju in recent weeks that have been attributed to underground cave-ins caused by the powerful test. Commercial satellite images have also found evidence of landslides near the test site, increasing fears of a further release of radioactive fallout if the North were to conduct another nuclear test there.
Unconfirmed news reports claimed that some residents in Kilju had fallen sick from radiation exposure. Earlier this month, an official newspaper in a Chinese province adjoining North Korea offered its readers tips on how to protect themselves from nuclear fallout.
On Wednesday, the Unification Ministry, a South Korean government agency in charge of North Korean affairs, said it would try to run tests on more defectors and offer medical help if any were determined to suffer from radiation exposure.
