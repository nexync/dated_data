Earlier this year, Disney said that it would build two Netflix-style streaming services to address structural challenges to its vast television businesses — namely that more consumers, particularly younger ones, are foregoing pricey cable subscriptions.
One question that would still hang over any transaction is how regulators would view such a deal. The Justice Department has sued to block AT&T’s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner, a so-called vertical merger that would unite the largest television distributor in the United States with a major content producer. The Trump administration has argued that the combination would give one company too much power over both the creation of content and its distribution.
The companies are fighting the government’s claims, asserting that they run contrary to established law. But deal makers have wondered whether the Trump administration’s stance would pose difficulties for any sale of Fox assets.
Representatives for Fox, Disney and Comcast declined to comment, or did not immediately respond to requests for comment, on the state of the talks. News of the talks having resumed was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
