On the same day that President Barack Obama announced new sanctions against Russia in retaliation for interference in the 2016 election, Mr. Flynn called a senior member of the presidential transition team who was with other members of the team at Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.
Mr. Flynn and the senior transition official discussed what Mr. Flynn should relay to Mr. Kislyak about the new sanctions and what effect they could have on Mr. Trump’s foreign policy agenda.
“Immediately” after his call with the senior transition official, Mr. Flynn called Mr. Kislyak, according to court documents made public Friday.
Court documents released on Friday as part of the special counsel’s investigation shed light on Mr. Flynn’s interactions with the then Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak.
The following day, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced that Moscow would not retaliate against the United States for its latest round of sanctions, surprising some in the Obama administration who had expected an aggressive response from Mr. Putin.
In response to Mr. Putin’s announcement, Mr. Trump praised the Russian president.
The Washington Post reported that Mr. Flynn had indeed discussed sanctions with the ambassador. In the days after that story, Mr. Pence read a transcript of at least one of the calls and saw that Mr. Flynn had mislead him, according to lawyers briefed on the investigation.
President Trump fired Mr. Flynn.
The following day, Sean Spicer, then the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Flynn had been fired for misleading Mr. Pence and other officials about what transpired on the phone calls with Mr. Kislyak.
“We’ve been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth,” he said.
