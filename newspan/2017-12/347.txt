Ms. Menzies-Urich — who was known as Heather Menzies throughout her acting career — played Louisa von Trapp, the third-oldest of the seven singing von Trapp children, in “The Sound of Music,” one of the most successful movies on the 1960s. Adapted from Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Broadway musical, it starred Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and won five Academy Awards, including best picture.
“Heather was part of ‘the family.’ There is really no other way to describe the members of the cast of the movie of ‘The Sound of Music,’ ” Ted Chapin, president and chief creative officer of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, said in a statement.
