Facing a proliferation of sexual assault allegations involving a former team doctor, USA Gymnastics, the governing body for the sport, last year signed a nondisclosure agreement as part of a settlement with one of the accusers, McKayla Maroney.
Maroney, a gold medalist at the 2012 London Games, is among the many gymnasts who have said they were abused by the doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar.
The settlement was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday by Maroney against the United States Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State, which employed Nassar. The existence of the suit was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
Michigan State said that it does not comment on continuing litigation.
Maroney’s lawyer, John Manly, called the confidentiality agreement “an immoral and illegal attempt to silence a victim of child sexual abuse” in exchange for a financial settlement.
Manly said that under California law the victim of child sexual abuse cannot be forced to sign a nondisclosure agreement as a condition of a settlement.
In addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks to nullify the nondisclosure agreement.
The suit said that Maroney agreed to the settlement in December 2016 in order to pay for psychological treatment. Nassar had been charged with criminal sexual conduct the previous month.
Maroney is one of dozens of former gymnasts who have said Nassar molested them when treating them. He pleaded guilty to molestation charges in November and will be sentenced in January, although he already received a 60-year sentence for child pornography.
Gold medalists Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas are among the other gymnasts who have accused Nassar of sexual assault.
