WASHINGTON — Responding to the retirement of a prominent appeals court judge accused of sexual harassment, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the federal court system must do more to protect law clerks and other employees from abusive conduct.
That was an unmistakable reference to the sudden retirement of Judge Alex Kozinski two weeks ago after The Washington Post reported that some 15 women had accused him of sexual harassment. Judge Kozinski had served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for more than three decades, establishing a reputation as a powerful and unpredictable intellect and a vivid writer.
The women, many of whom had served as his law clerks, said Judge Kozinski had touched them inappropriately, made unwanted sexual comments and forced them to view sexual materials on his computer.
In announcing his retirement, Judge Kozinski suggested that he had been misunderstood and apologized.
Chief Justice Roberts said he had assembled a task force to examine whether the court system’s procedures for addressing inappropriate conduct were adequate. The young lawyers who serve as law clerks to judges, typically for a year soon after graduating from law school, may require special attention, he suggested, as they are meant to keep confidential what happens in their judge’s chambers.
“I expect the working group to consider whether changes are needed in our codes of conduct, our guidance to employees — including law clerks — on issues of confidentiality and reporting of instances of misconduct, our educational programs, and our rules for investigating and processing misconduct complaints,” Chief Justice Roberts wrote.
The remarks on sexual harassment were a brief coda, probably added late in the drafting process, to a report mostly devoted to the court system’s efforts to prepare for natural disasters.
The past year’s weather posed special challenges, he wrote.
