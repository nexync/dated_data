One of the world’s best-known ballet dancers has resigned from the American Ballet Theater after he was accused of sexual misconduct, the company said on Thursday.
The dancer, Marcelo Gomes, was a principal at the American Ballet Theater and was with the company for two decades.
“Last Saturday, A.B.T. was made aware of a highly concerning allegation of sexual misconduct by Mr. Gomes, occurring approximately eight years ago,” the chairman of the company’s board of trustees, Andrew F. Barth, said in an emailed statement.
Mr. Barth said the alleged episode did not involve any current or former members of A.B.T. and was not related to Mr. Gomes’s “employment duties” with the company.
Neither A.B.T. nor the law firm that was handling the investigation would give further details about the accusation against Mr. Gomes. “A.B.T. does not tolerate the alleged behavior,” Mr. Barth said in his statement. “I am profoundly disheartened by this matter,” he added.
Mr. Gomes, 38, began dancing in his native Brazil. He joined the American Ballet Theater in 1997 and became a principal dancer in 2002. His last performance with the company was in “The Nutcracker” on Dec. 9.
As a performer, Mr. Gomes was known for his strength, stage presence and versatility. He was also a choreographer and the subject of a documentary, “Anatomy of a Male Ballet Dancer,” which is scheduled to premier at Film Forum in New York City next month. The film’s directors did not immediately respond to an email or a voice mail message seeking comment on Thursday.
The allegation of sexual misconduct against Mr. Gomes is one of dozens in recent months that have spurred investigations and resignations in industries including filmmaking, technology, fashion and food service. The #MeToo movement has also touched ballet; Peter Martins, the longtime leader of New York City Ballet, has been accused of sexual harassment and abuse.
