1. Who posed the Twitter question about the jumping electrical tower? What is that person’s job title and where is the job located?

3. How does Chris Plack, a professor of audiology at the Manchester Centre for Audiology and Deafness, explain hearing that doesn’t require external noise, and why?
4. What is “visual EAR?” What is the ability to “vEAR,” and what does it mean for flashing lights in silent videos?
5. How do perception, memory and imagination come together to make it easy for some people to visually hear?
