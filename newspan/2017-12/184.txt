Twitter feuds claimed another high-profile casualty on Tuesday when the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates deleted his account after sparring with the Harvard philosopher Cornel West.
Late on Monday, Mr. Coates, who had more than 1.25 million Twitter followers as of earlier this month, tweeted, “Peace, y’all. I’m out. I didn’t get in it for this.” And at some point after that, he deleted his account.
Mr. Coates’s latest book, “We Were Eight Years in Power,” collects some of his columns from The Atlantic and reckons with Mr. Obama’s presidency.
In his thread on Sunday, Mr. Cobb suggested Mr. West’s argument was driven less by intellectual differences than by professional rivalry.
Others expressed dismay that many Twitter users were focused on what the writer and sociologist Eve Ewing described as “some dudes being mad at each other,” rather than deeper issues.
