Amaro, the traditional Italian herbal liqueur, is a perfect drink to follow holiday overindulgence. Amaro dell’Etna, which I first sampled at a cafe in Catania, the Sicilian city near where it has been made since 1901, is now available in the United States. It is distinguished by its herbal notes, hints of licorice and especially its fragrant essence of blood oranges, grown at the base of Mount Etna. And it is less sweet than some other popular brands of Italian amaro. Try it in a Boulevardier with bourbon and sweet vermouth: Amaro dell’Etna, $36.96, Astor Wines and Spirits, astorwines.com.
