Visitors were greeted by free temporary tattoos of a stylized gold ovary from the Lady Parts Justice League, a nonprofit organization that fights for reproductive rights. Farther along, wanderers in search of statement gifts could pick up a “No Means No” cap from Believe Me; a T-shirt with “It’s my body, it’s my choice” written across it from My Sister; and a bracelet with #shepersisted carved on it from Activated NYC.
Beyond that, the fair was a home for the niche: Products on sale included crystals (many, many of them); pins depicting a crying Drake; homemade vegan beauty products; a tea whose profits go to artisans in Kenya; earrings with covers of books including “The Thing Around Your Neck” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; and drawings of Frida Kahlo.
One booth offered kits with instructions and materials for making pillows, bracelets and necklaces using needlepoint. “I can’t do anything else,” said Jenny Henry, 43, their creator, referring to needlepoint, out of which she has built a 20-year career.
Not far from Ms. Henry’s booth was Aela Alchemy, where Micaela Foley, 26, and Kaela May, 29, were selling crystal and clay jewelry, as well as biodegradable glitter bombs (little tubs of glitter and wax that you can spread across your skin).
She and Ms. Foley were also offering packets of pre-mixed herbs with names like the Lovers and the High Priestess, to add to “other herbs you might smoke,” Ms. May said.
Ms. Mullin asked the women at the table what they do to relax.
“I wish I could say I do yoga,” one said.
“Face plant on the bed,” said another, clearly less laden with yoga guilt.
Later, Ms. Mullin circled the table, sniffing the scent combinations her students had chosen, and suggested that those who live in New York could use the salts in a bath for their feet rather than their full body. “New Yorkers don’t have bathtubs, or they share them with lots of people,” she said, eliciting knowing nods.
