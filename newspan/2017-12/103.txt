LONDON — The London Zoo reopened on Sunday after more than 70 firefighters battled a blaze that destroyed a gift shop and cafe, killed an aardvark and left some staff members suffering from smoke inhalation, the zoo said.
Four missing meerkats were presumed dead, the zoo said.
The zoo, in Regent’s Park in central London, which was shut to visitors, reopened “after consultation with fire experts,” the zoo said on Sunday.
The fire broke out shortly after 6 a.m. Saturday local time in the Animal Adventure section, the zoo said in a statement.
Half a petting zoo and an adjacent gift shop and cafe were destroyed, according to the London Fire Brigade.
Staff members from the zoo quickly moved animals like llamas and camels to safety, and the fire was brought under control after 9 a.m.
The zoo later discovered that a 9-year-old aardvark named Misha had died, a spokeswoman said. The zoo said in a statement on Sunday that an initial post mortem showed that the aardvark most likely died from smoke inhalation while sleeping.
“We are all naturally devastated by this, but are immensely grateful to the fire brigade, who reacted quickly to the situation to bring the fire under control,” the zoo said.
The Fire Brigade, which sent 72 firefighters and 10 fire engines to the blaze, said on Saturday that a firefighter had suffered a wrist injury and was taken to the hospital as a precaution.
The world’s oldest scientific zoo, the London zoo dates back to the 1800s and houses more than 20,000 animals, according to its 2017 inventory. The zoo is estimated to receive more than a million visitors each year.
