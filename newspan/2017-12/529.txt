Update: Read about our event in West Frankfort, Ill. on Dec. 14.
In late February, the Times ran my article about a man who had been detained by immigration authorities. His name was Juan Carlos Hernandez Pacheco, or just Carlos to most people in his small Southern Illinois community around West Frankfort. Most residents of the coal-mining community had voted for President Trump and largely favored the president’s tough approach on immigration. But when they found out that Carlos had been arrested as an illegal immigrant, they rallied behind him.
The story and an episode about Carlos on “The Daily” podcast struck a chord with readers and listeners, who said the accounts surprised them and gave them a deeper sense of the nuanced ways that new federal policies were playing out in real life.
I am coming back to West Frankfort on Dec. 14 to talk about the story, but also about immigration, the future of coal, the economy, taxes and the mood now in the town that rallied around Carlos. We have teamed up with the region’s newspaper, The Southern Illinoisan, for what we hope will be a lively, wide-ranging conversation about life in Southern Illinois. Our panel will include Cindy Buys, an immigration law expert; Don Jones, the Franklin County sheriff; Tom Jordan, the mayor of West Frankfort; Jim Muir, a coal miner-turned-Circuit Court Clerk; and Molly Parker, a reporter from The Southern Illinoisan.
We are hoping that many people from West Frankfort and the surrounding towns will come and share their questions, story ideas and daily concerns. I am eager to hear them. You can submit questions in advance in the comments of this article.
The event is free, but please RSVP here.
