Mr. Barak makes plain his rejection of the democratic will of the Israeli people. Perhaps he’s just reciprocating; that same public rejected him after just over a year and a half in office, making him the shortest serving prime minister in Israeli history.
The reason Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is now serving in his fourth term is that the Israeli people know that he is strengthening the country, protecting its citizens, leading an unprecedented flourishing of Israel’s diplomatic relations and unleashing the full potential of its economy.
Amazingly, Mr. Barak blames Prime Minister Netanyahu for the lack of peace. Apparently he forgot that he himself offered the Palestinians a state in nearly every inch of the West Bank in 2000. The Palestinians rejected that offer and launched the worst campaign of terror in Israel’s history, killing over a thousand men, women and children.
Contrary to Mr. Barak’s spurious claims, Israel has a vibrant free press, a thriving civil society and an independent judiciary. Far from dividing Israelis, Prime Minister Netanyahu shows deep concern for all sectors of Israeli society (including Arab Israelis, whose communities he is supporting with unprecedented levels of funding), because he believes that all citizens should benefit from Israel’s economic miracle.
Mr. Barak is welcome to try his hand at politics again, but his political future will undoubtedly end like his political past if he continues to besmirch and belittle the will of the Israeli people. Instead of making his case to The New York Times, he might try to convince his fellow citizens, for whom he has such obvious disdain and for whom the feeling is so clearly mutual.
