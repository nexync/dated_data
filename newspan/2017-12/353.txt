As of last year, some 199 million adults in India were overweight or obese according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Since 1990, the percentage of India’s adult population with diabetes has surged to 7.7 percent — some 63 million people — from 5.5 percent.
Although cases of obesity and being overweight are far less prevalent in India (24 percent last year) than in Canada (about 60 percent), for example, adults there are just as likely to develop diabetes as in Canada, a New York Times analysis of data from the institute found.
Coca-Cola Company’s chief executive, James Quincey, in an interview with Indian news media earlier this year, said that he expected the Indian market to eventually become the company’s third largest in sales, up from sixth.
