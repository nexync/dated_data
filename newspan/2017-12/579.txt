The sanctions, proposed by the U.S. and adopted on Friday by a vote of 15 to 0, were the third round this year in a continuing effort to force the North to halt its weapons program and resume negotiations.
Under the new sanctions, fuel supplies will be drastically cut, and about 100,000 North Koreans working abroad will be expelled within two years.
Even after escaping Myanmar, many Rohingya survivors find themselves vulnerable and commodified in the brokenness of refugee life.
In this video, we followed a Rohingya family over four days as they fled to Bangladesh, where hope turned to tragedy. And here’s a closer look at the Rohingya exodus — one of the most rapid mass departures in modern history.
• A Pakistani film about a rape victim who brings her politically powerful attacker to justice has inspired Pakistani women to expose sexual harassment in a country where the discussion of such topics is often discouraged.
“Verna,” starring Pakistan’s most popular and highest-paid actress, Mahira Khan, above, was banned by state censors, but a public outcry, fueled by a social media campaign tapping into the spirit of the global #MeToo movement, helped overturn the ruling.
• President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has threatened to phase out jeepneys, the brashly painted passenger trucks that are emblems of Manila’s clogged streets.
Critics contend that jeepneys, above, are not safe. Twenty people were killed on Monday in the country’s north when a jeepney collided with a bus on the way to Christmas Mass.
Still, banning jeepneys would pit the populist president against the working poor, who ride and drive them every day.
Separately, Mr. Duterte’s eldest son resigned as the vice mayor of Davao City after his teenage daughter implied he had beaten her.
• Christmas is more popular than ever in India, but tensions have dampened celebrations.
It’s all part of a broader ideological battle across India based on religious identity.
• Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day address to warn that the “winds of war” and an “outdated model of development” were taking a toll on humanity, society and the environment.
But Francis also used the opportunity to pray for a positive turn of events: a resuscitation of a two-state solution in the Middle East, the healing of war-torn Syria and Ukraine; the easing of tensions on the Korean Peninsula; and a return to dialogue in Venezuela.
• Rupert Murdoch and President Trump have traveled in the same circles since the 1970s, but they became close only recently. Here’s a look at this new friendship of convenience.
• Vice Media built itself from a fringe magazine into a nearly $6 billion global company. But its boundary-pushing culture created a workplace that was degrading for women, current and former employees say.
• In this Times video, check out the military-grade crowd-control system developed by China-based Norinco, with water cannons and tear gas launchers. Experts say it’s overkill, but at least one customer — Venezuela — disagrees.
• Bitcoin is huge in Asia, which accounts for the bulk of trading in the cryptocurrency. But some worry the bubble could harm financial stability.
• U.S. markets were closed for Christmas. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.
Tips, both new and old, for a more fulfilling life.

• Postcards from foreign correspondents. “Journals” are a longstanding Times feature that try to take readers to new places. These were some of our favorites from the year.
• In memoriam. Hiep Thi Le, 46, a Vietnamese refugee who was cast in Oliver Stone’s 1993 film “Heaven and Earth”; Jerry Yellin, 93, who flew the last World War II combat mission over Japan and later fought post-traumatic stress disorder.
• Finally, themed mugs and nightclub tours. Britain’s monarchy can be big money. And with Prince Harry marrying Meghan Markle next year, tour groups and other companies are ready to capitalize.
It’s a mystery that still endures in Australia.
He was never seen again, and his body was never recovered.
A police inquiry the next year determined that it was nothing more than an accident. An inquest in 2005 officially ruled Mr. Holt’s death an accidental drowning.
But his disappearance spurred a wealth of conspiracy theories, including that the prime minister had committed suicide or was assassinated by the C.I.A. One even claimed that Mr. Holt was a lifelong spy for China and had faked his death by boarding a Chinese submarine.
His legacy also lives on in another, if slightly macabre, way: at the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Center in Melbourne.
