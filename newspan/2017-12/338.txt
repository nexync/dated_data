TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — At every home game at the University of Alabama, where I am a sophomore, the fraternities sit in a reserved corner of the stadium. My freshman year, they wore Trump stickers. This year, they traded them in for Roy Moore-style white cowboy hats.

In Alabama, my home state, it’s not always easy to speak up — or sit down, as the case may be. But there has never been a more important time to do so.
At a time when a man accused of molesting teenagers is in a tight race for a Senate seat, the University of Alabama is full of #MeToos. And we must listen to them, value them, respect them and remember them.

She was denied appropriate counseling and the chance to be believed. After she left the university, she took her own life.

Jonathon Kozol, who chronicled inequality in America’s schools, never wrote about the school system in Alabama, but his phrase “savage inequality” rings true when applied to it. Segregation is still rampant here. In crumbling public schools, black students pledge allegiance to dusty flags in cramped rooms, across from bathrooms with few working toilets.
I grew up in Tuscaloosa as a blue dot in a sea of red, where the voices of the powerful drowned out the opposition. My home was gerrymandered into the “good” school zone. But I lived just across the tracks from Central High School, which made national news for becoming resegregated.
Roy Moore is a key member of the chorus of politicians who talk but do not listen, and if he is elected, he won’t fix any of these problems. If anything, he is a symbol of the way they fester and grow.
