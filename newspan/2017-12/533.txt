Your Dec. 7 news article “Many Modern Contraceptives Still Linked to Breast Cancer, Study Finds” has raised unjustifiable alarm. The recent study found that hormonal contraceptive use, irrespective of hormone type, dosage or mode of administration, was associated with more frequent diagnosis of breast cancer.
This can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that clinical visits to obtain a prescription contraceptive increase opportunities to diagnose breast cancer. Yet, the study did not control for health care utilization. Early diagnosis of cancer often leads to effective treatment and reduces cancer-related deaths.
Given the existing literature showing that hormonal contraception reduces both cancer-related and all-cause mortality, raising false alarms about the safety of contraceptives is a disservice to women. Scares about the safety of contraceptives predictably decrease contraceptive use and increase unwanted pregnancies.
Given how well studied contraceptives are, any new information must be presented within the context of all that is already known. New alarm about the relationship between birth control and breast cancer is unwarranted.
