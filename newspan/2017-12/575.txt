LONDON — Britain’s prime minister, Theresa May, suffered a new and damaging setback on Wednesday when a close and trusted ally, Damian Green, was forced to resign his cabinet post, after an investigation found that he misled the public about pornography found on his parliamentary computer.
Mr. Green, who was effectively Mrs. May’s deputy, is the second cabinet minister to quit after allegations of sexual harassment and other misconduct engulfed British politics in the wake of the scandal involving the American movie producer Harvey Weinstein.
Another former minister, Priti Patel, also resigned from the cabinet last month after breaching ministerial rules by holding a dozen unauthorized meetings with Israeli officials during a summer vacation.
An investigation found that Mr. Green had breached the ministerial code by making “inaccurate and misleading” statements about what he knew of claims that pornography had been found on a computer in his parliamentary office in 2008.
In his resignation letter, Mr. Green said he regretted that he had been asked to stand aside, but apologized for his actions. Mrs. May said that it was with “deep regret” that she was asking him to resign. He is, however, retaining his seat in Parliament.
