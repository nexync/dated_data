The biographer Robert A. Caro needed more than 1,200 pages to unspool the story of Robert Moses’s life and career in his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1974 masterwork, “The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York.” In 1981, when Moses died, Paul Goldberger spent upward of 5,000 words writing his obituary in The New York Times.
So it is probably ill advised that Peter Galperin and Daniel Scot Kadin take a mere 90 minutes to tell his tale in “Bulldozer: The Ballad of Robert Moses,” their confused new rock musical at the Theater at St. Clement’s. In choosing what to leave in and what to throw out, they have made a pared-to-the-bone show with an undistinguished score by Mr. Galperin, no pulsing human vitality and no dramatic tension.
Its inertness is not the fault of the five-person cast, led by the Broadway veteran Constantine Maroulis as Moses, whom we first meet as a broken-down old man in a dressing gown, a blanket tossed across his lap. Mr. Maroulis has a lovely way with the show’s more wistful numbers and a nice chemistry with Kacie Sheik as Vera Martin, a seemingly composite character who is Moses’s loyal assistant and longtime lover, though we are led for a whole scene to believe that she is his wife.
A large problem is that Mr. Galperin and Mr. Kadin, who collaborated on the book, haven’t given the actors — including Molly Pope as Jane Jacobs, Moses’s downtown nemesis, and Wayne Wilcox as Nelson Rockefeller, the governor who stood up to Moses — fully drawn characters or relationships to play. Directed by Karen Carpenter, the show gets bogged down in conveying information, occasionally with the help of a quasi-narrator (Ryan Knowles) who is, somewhat bafflingly in this rock context, a folk musician.
