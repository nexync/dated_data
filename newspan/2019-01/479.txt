References to poems like W.B. Yeats’s “Leda and the Swan” and T.S. Eliot’s “Little Gidding” provide a literary framework for the acts of creation and survival that sustain the last two people on Earth, which is in the process of evolving past the species that ransacked it. But at heart, “IO” is mostly a lugubrious Adam and Eve story, staked on the chemistry between scientists who are almost too swamped in ennui to tend to the garden.
As Sam Walden (Margaret Qualley of “The Leftovers”) manages solar panels and bee colonies at an altitude where the air is still breathable, the film initially suggests an Earthbound, budget-conscious “The Martian,” with a lone brainiac thinking her way through catastrophe. But when the mysterious Micah (Anthony Mackie) floats through on a helium balloon, seeking guidance from Sam’s absent father (Danny Huston), the dynamic between Sam and Micah shifts the film into romantic melodrama, as lifeless and as chaste as the windswept apocalypse that surrounds them.
The miraculous hatching of a “virgin queen” among a dead hive is typical of a film more interested in symbols of human resilience than in the flesh-and-blood passions that animate it. Sam and Micah may be the defibrillators necessary to bring life to a dying planet, but they don’t have much of a pulse.
