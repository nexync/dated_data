Do you own a smartphone? How often do you use it?
Now imagine: How long could you go without your phone? Months? Weeks? Days?
More than three-quarters of all Americans own a smartphone. In 2018 those 253 million Americans spent $1,380 and 1,460 hours on their smartphone and other mobile devices. That’s 91 waking days; cumulatively, that adds up to 370 billion waking American hours and $349 billion.

He pedaled 16 hours a day for a total of 1,264 hours — or just under a year’s worth of smartphone usage. Average humans couldn’t match Mr. Beaumont’s feat, but the money and time saved by ditching their phones would afford them a lot of time with a personal trainer.

How many virtuosos will we lose in the years ahead if device use among young people continues to grow apace?
