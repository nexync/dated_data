The Nets needed one more victory to match their best stretch in four years. Instead, they stumbled in Toronto — again.
Kawhi Leonard had 20 points and 11 rebounds, Pascal Siakam scored 16 points and the Raptors beat the Nets, 122-105, on Friday night for their second seven-game home winning streak of the season.
“I rarely say this about our team, but I didn’t love the effort tonight,” Nets Coach Kenny Atkinson said.
The Nets entered with 13 wins in 17 games, a run that began with a 106-105 overtime victory over Toronto on Dec. 7. The Nets last won 14 of 18 in the 2013-14 season.
Toronto has won 13 of the past 14 meetings with the Nets, including seven straight north of the border. The Nets have not won in Toronto since Feb. 4, 2015.
Serge Ibaka added 14 points, O G Anunoby and Norman Powell each had 13, Delon Wright had 12 to help Toronto improve to 18-4 at home. They last lost at home Dec. 9 to Milwaukee.
The Raptors have won four straight over all and six of seven. The only loss in that stretch was Jan. 3 at San Antonio. Leonard reached 20 points for the 18th consecutive game, extending his career-best streak.
“It’s what we’re looking for, a total team effort,” said guard Fred VanVleet, one of five Toronto reserves to score at least 10 points. The Raptors finished with 60 bench points, two shy of a season high.
D’Angelo Russell led the Nets with 24 points. Shabazz Napier added 15 points, and Jarrett Allen had 12 rebounds.
Russell scored 12 points in the first and the Nets closed the quarter with a 14-3 run to take a 35-28 lead. It was the Nets’ highest-scoring first quarter on the road this season.
Toronto turned the tables in the second, overcoming a 1-point deficit by outscoring the Nets by 15-3 over the final 2 minutes 55 seconds. The Raptors outscored the Nets, 36-18, in the second and led by 64-53 at halftime.
Siakam scored 9 points and Ibaka had 8 as the Raptors pulled away in the third, connecting on 16 of 32 shots. Toronto took a 99-75 lead into the fourth.
PACERS 121, KNICKS 106 Domantas Sabonis had 22 points and 15 rebounds to cap his sizzling season at Madison Square Garden, and Indiana bounced back from its worst performance of the season by beating the Knicks.
Sabonis shot 9 for 14 from the field to finish 21 of 26 this season in two games at the Garden. He made all 12 shots and tied his career high with 30 points when the Pacers won here on Halloween.
Starting this time with Myles Turner out of the lineup, he led six players in double figures as Indiana shot 52 percent.
Victor Oladipo added 19 points for the Pacers, who yielding season highs of 135 points and 56.8 percent shooting in their 27-point loss in Boston on Wednesday.
Emmanuel Mudiay scored 21 points for the Knicks, back from a six-game trip and playing their first game at Madison Square Garden since Christmas. They lost their seventh straight at home.
