The group’s national commander offers perspective on a news article.
Yes, we are old. In March, the American Legion will have its 100th birthday. And just as our founders and previous generations of Legionnaires have tirelessly served their communities and veterans since 1919, today’s American Legion is as relevant as ever.
We have thousands of certified service officers in communities across the country who will assist veterans with claims and benefits, free of charge and regardless of their Legion membership status.
We sponsor job fairs for veterans and welcome into our ranks any current active-duty, reservist or Guard member or honorably discharged wartime veterans of previous generations regardless of whether they served in the United States or overseas.
There are many important issues facing veterans today. From the enacting of the V.A. Mission Act, which consolidates community medical care programs into a single, streamlined service, to obtaining benefits provided by the “Forever” G.I. Bill, which removes the deadlines that veterans had to use their G.I. Bill educational benefits, today’s veterans can be confident that the American Legion will continue to be on their side, fighting for their interests in the halls of Congress and at V.A. facilities around the country.
