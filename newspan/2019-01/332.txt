Our planet’s elliptical orbit doesn’t affect winter or summer temperatures. But some astronomers wonder whether it’s a factor in why life survives.
This story was updated to reflect 2020’s perihelion.
In the wee hours of Sunday (2:47 a.m. Eastern time, to be exact), Earth will make its closest approach to the sun and reach a point in its orbit known as perihelion. Chilly as winter may feel in the Northern Hemisphere, we’re more than three million miles closer to our fiery star than we were in the dead of summer.
Roughly 650 million years ago, for instance, vast sheets of glaciers entombed our planet in a frozen skin that lingered for millions of years. It was a deep freeze, similar to what happens when these elliptical planets approach aphelion, that should have been deadly.
