The listings that got the most attention last month on The New York Times’s Find a Home site all had one thing in common: striking water, park or city views.
The most popular listing in the final month if 2018 was a home overlooking the Saint Lawrence River. The four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom house is set high on a slope, with multiple terraces that offer vistas of the water and beyond.
Up from fifth place in November was a home that looked as if it took its cues from the palace of Versailles, with more than 20,000 square feet of space adorned with sumptuously crafted Beaux-Arts detail, in a prime Manhattan location.
Coming in third was a rental in a high-end condominium in the Fitler Square neighborhood of Philadelphia. The 14th-floor apartment comes with three bedrooms, three and a half bathrooms, bird’s-eye views of the city and perks like valet garage parking and 24-hour concierge service.
Falling to fourth place was the resort-like property on the Manazuru Peninsula that occupied the No. 1 spot in October and November. Designed for entertaining, the 8.5-acre estate has a Jacuzzi, tennis court, golf simulator and theater with a karaoke system.
Coming in at No. 5 was a penthouse rental in Jersey City with direct views of Manhattan. The home has two bedrooms and two full bathrooms, high-end modern finishes and a private 400-square-foot roof deck with a grill.
