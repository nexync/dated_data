Two couples in the wedding announcements, Hannah Diamond and Sam Feldman, and Lindsay Church and Andrew Ellis, who were all in the same Harvard Law School section, were married this weekend. Two other classmates, Habin Chung and Mark Jia, were also married (in 2017) after connecting in the class.
The couples were in the same first-year section (similar to a homeroom period) called 1L, Section 6. Jon D. Hanson, their torts professor, who is also responsible for supervising and orchestrating intellectual and social activities, leads the section.
Professor Hanson, who has taught at the university for 26 years, weighed in on the romances with three theories.
Ms. Diamond, one of the lawyers marrying this weekend, wholeheartedly agreed.
Sam Feldman, who first became friends with Ms. Diamond in the section and began dating her toward the end of law school, thought more along the lines of theory No. 2.
Ms. Church could not agree more.
Professor Hanson’s third theory is a more elaborate version of the second one.
In any case, the professor appreciates all the romance.
“Who doesn’t love the idea of young people creating long-term friendships, and finding love in the beginning of their vocations and their careers?” Professor Hanson said.
This weekend, he will again be asking key questions as he leads a roomful of people, two of whom are sure to be especially attentive: He is the officiant for the Diamond-Feldman ceremony.
“I’m thrilled,” he said.
