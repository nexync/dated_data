Barney Fein is a depraved Hollywood mogul — “a bloated monster” — whose fall from grace can be seen in London’s West End starting in June.
He is also based in part on Harvey Weinstein.
“Bitter Wheat,” written and directed by David Mamet and starring John Malkovich, will open at Garrick Theater in London on June 7 for a limited run, the theater announced Tuesday.
Mr. Mamet wrote the play in response to the #MeToo allegations against Mr. Weinstein and others in Hollywood, the theater said.
“I think it’s a terrific piece of writing,” he added.
Neither Mr. Mamet or Mr. Malkovich were available for comment.
Mr. Mamet’s last two original plays — “The Penitent,” which ran Off Broadway in 2017, and “China Doll,” which ran on Broadway in 2015 — were not critically well received. An all-female production of Mr. Mamet’s acclaimed “Glengarry Glen Ross” is expected on Broadway this year.
