The director Catherine Hardwicke narrates a sequence from the film featuring Gina Rodriguez.
In this video, the director Catherine Hardwicke breaks down the high-stakes sequence: Gloria has been asked to surrender her phone to be searched because cartel members are trying to root out a mole. The phone ends up in a bag with several others, and does indeed have a chip in it from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Gloria has to figure out a way to get to the bag and get the chip out of her phone before sheâ€™s discovered.
Hardwicke talks about the blending of hand-held, close-up camerawork with a score of built-in heartbeat sounds to help amp up the tension.
