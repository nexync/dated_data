Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who is considering a 2020 bid on a centrist Democratic platform, rejected the idea of “Medicare for all,” which has been gaining traction among Democrats.
“I think you could never afford that. You’re talking about trillions of dollars,” Mr. Bloomberg said during a political swing in New Hampshire, which holds the nation’s first primary in 2020.
Mr. Bloomberg did not mention any of his would-be competitors by name. But his wording — particularly the distinction he drew between providing Medicare to everyone and providing it only to those currently uninsured — positioned him clearly against Senator Harris.
Lily Adams, a spokeswoman for Ms. Harris, responded to Mr. Bloomberg on Twitter, noting that he is a billionaire.
But the campaign’s move to modify Ms. Harris’s comments on such a major issue illustrated the difficulty the 2020 hopefuls could face attempting to appeal to their progressive base while not turning off general election voters.
The disagreement between Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Harris reflects a basic divide within the Democratic Party. On one side are liberals who have proposed ambitious left-wing policies, from “Medicare for all” to a wealth tax on the richest Americans. On the other side are centrist and fiscally conservative Democrats, along with liberals who support such policies in theory but argue that voters would reject them.
