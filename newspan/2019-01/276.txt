The birth of the British monarch, who ruled over her global empire from ages 18 to 81, is being marked by exhibitions and tours in 2019.
She was a sprightly girl of 18 when she ascended to the throne of the British Empire in 1837, and a revered global presence — a grandmotherly figure to her millions of subjects — when she died in 1901 at 81. In 2019, the Victorian Era will be again celebrated throughout Britain as the country marks the 200th anniversary of the queen’s birth.
For those wanting to cross the Atlantic and join the celebrations, here is a roundup of the festivities that will be taking place, from museum exhibits to travel packages and tours.
Though it’s possible to visit the places frequented by Victoria on your own, National Trust Tours — a subsidiary of the National Trust for Historic Preservation — has created a 10-day “Queen Victoria 200” trip that features the most important landmarks. It includes stops at Windsor Castle, the primary palace during her reign; Westminster Abbey, where she was crowned in 1838; and the Chapel Royal at St. James’s Palace, where she married Prince Albert two years later. The tour also includes a visit to the queen’s summer Italianate retreat, Osborne House, on the Isle of Wight, where the gardens, home and children’s cottage give a true glimpse into the family’s life. Priced at $4,950 per person, not including airfare.
