Looks like the Golden Globes and the Directors Guild of America are in agreement.
Two days after the Globes featured a best-director category consisting of Bradley Cooper for “A Star is Born,” Alfonso Cuarón for “Roma,” Peter Farrelly for “Green Book,” Spike Lee for “BlacKkKlansman,” and Adam McKay for “Vice,” the D.G.A. has nominated those five men for its top honor, as well.
Will Oscar now follow suit? The Academy Awards typically make at least one substitution in this race: Last year, the “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” director Martin McDonagh scored a D.G.A. nomination but was replaced by Paul Thomas Anderson for “Phantom Thread” come Oscar time.
Still, the Directors Guild nominations continue to add momentum to several strong contenders, including Cuarón, who won the best-director Globe and whom many presume to be the Oscar front-runner, as well as Farrelly, whose film won best musical or comedy at the Globes. In the wake of a few high-profile Globe losses on Sunday, Cooper can comfort himself with the knowledge that “A Star Is Born” has now been nominated by every major guild, indicating a wide base of industry support.
Snubbed by the D.G.A. were a few directors who could still find favor with Oscar, like Ryan Coogler for “Black Panther,” Yorgos Lanthimos for “The Favourite,” and Barry Jenkins for “If Beale Street Could Talk.” And though “Bohemian Rhapsody” has picked up steam in recent weeks as an award contender, winning two Golden Globes on Sunday, the Directors Guild’s largess did not extend to Bryan Singer, who was fired during the film’s production.
Winners of the D.G.A. awards will be announced Feb. 2 in Hollywood. The nominations, including the picks for best first-time director — another all-male list — are below.
