Benjamin Norman has moved in New York 8 times in the past 13 years, never knowing his neighbors. In Bushwick, he’s trying to break this cycle.
Despite being crammed alongside 27,000 others per square mile, New Yorkers have a surprisingly hard time meeting people living less than 10 feet from their doormats. Benjamin Norman knows this well because he is one of them.
For Mr. Norman, change followed from disaster: This past summer, over a year after moving to Bushwick, Mr. Norman injured his back and wound up spending a month cooped up in his apartment. During these weeks of isolation, Mr. Norman missed seeing his neighbors outside the Mr. Kiwi’s grocery store or grabbing coffee from the deli on his way to the Myrtle-Broadway subway stop. He resolved to connect with them after he had healed.
Somehow, bringing a camera to capture the community made his mission more convincing, at least to some people.
There is silver-haired Evelyn Rueda, zooming down Troutman Street on her cherry red scooter, bagged groceries in tow; and Helena, known around the block as “the candy lady,” who might stop you to swap a red-and-white peppermint from the doctor’s office in exchange for 25 cents, no further questions asked.
The social scene is wherever you look. At Enrique’s Unisex Hair Salon, you can find Celeste Ramos and Wendy Sanchez and the rest of staff, who will cut your hair while regulars wolf down their sandwiches from across the street; and don’t forget the M train platforms, where packed crowds and groans tend to follow delay announcements.
