JOHANNESBURG — At least three people were killed and approximately 300 were injured on Tuesday after two trains collided in South Africa’s administrative capital, Pretoria, an emergency services official said.
The crash, at 9:30 a.m., left 82 passengers with serious injuries after a packed train careered into a stationary train at the Mountain View station.
“We do not rule out the possibility of additional fatalities as we search under the wreckage,” the emergency official, Charles Mabaso, told Reuters.
The authorities were investigating the cause of the collision, the latest in a series of train accidents in South Africa, which has the continent’s largest rail network.
In October, 320 people were injured after a packed train traveling from Johannesburg to Pretoria crashed into the back of a stationary train.
