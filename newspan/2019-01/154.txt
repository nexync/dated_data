The country’s ambassador to the United States takes issue with an editorial.
“Bangladesh’s Farcical Vote” (editorial, Jan. 16) correctly identifies why Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was re-elected: a booming economy, a dramatic reduction in poverty, and human development indicators that outpace even its runaway growth.
But it’s wrong when it suggests that voters were intimidated into voting for her party, the Awami League. Law enforcement authorities reined in pre-election violence not for political reasons but to ensure a peaceful and fair vote, which is what most election observers said it was.
There were no mass arrests. Indeed, compared with previous elections, the 2018 vote was tranquil and safe.
Voters look to their government for security and economic progress. Prime Minister Hasina has provided both. That’s why her party won overwhelmingly.
