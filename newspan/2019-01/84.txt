LONDON — Prince Philip, the 97-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, was involved on Thursday in a car crash while driving himself on a rural road north of London, injuring two women in another vehicle.
The prince was unhurt, as was a 9-month-old boy in the women’s car, a Kia, the Norfolk police said. He was driving a black Land Rover S.U.V. near the royal family’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, near the North Sea coast, a spokeswoman at Buckingham Palace said.
She confirmed that the queen was not in the vehicle at the time of the crash.
A 45-year-old passenger in the other vehicle suffered a broken wrist, and the driver, 28, had cuts to her knee, the Norfolk Constabulary said in a statement. Both were treated at a hospital in the nearby town of King’s Lynn and then discharged.
The prince’s S.U.V. rolled over, eyewitnesses told British news organizations, and photos from the scene showed it lying on its side on the shoulder of the A149 road, its window cracked. The other vehicle sat nearby, upright but nosed into a ditch beside the road.
Prince Philip officially retired from his public duties in the autumn of 2017 and stopped all official engagements, but he has kept busy in the time since. He has continued to drive cars and is regularly seen driving horse-drawn carriages and walking on the sprawling estate. In 2016, when he was 94, Prince Philip drove President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama and Queen Elizabeth when they visited Windsor Castle.
There is no upper age limit for driving in Britain, but drivers over 70 have to renew their licenses every three years and report any new medical conditions.
