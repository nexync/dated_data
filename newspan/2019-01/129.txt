More than 30,000 Los Angeles public schoolteachers went on strike on Monday after months of unfruitful negotiations with the Los Angeles Unified School District. The teachers are asking for higher wages, smaller class sizes and more support staff in schools, including nurses, librarians and guidance counselors. Here are three books on teachers’ historical battle for improved working conditions and one mother’s year navigating the public school system in Los Angeles.
Goldstein begins her “lively account of the history of teaching” (our reviewer’s words) in the 1820s, when early iterations of public schooling — “common schools” — were beginning to take form. She writes about how the field became dominated by women who received lower pay and explains that many of the solutions that have been put in place over the years, such as evaluating teachers based on student test scores or programs like Teach For America, have historical precedents.
This book highlights Albert Shanker, a union president who led teachers’ strikes in late 1960s New York City after 18 unionized white educators were fired as part of an initiative to create a black local school district in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville sector of Brooklyn. Though Shanker agreed that the teaching force needed to be diversified, he took a different approach, working to unionize teacher aides, who tended to be people of color, and negotiating a stipend for them to get their college degrees and become teachers. Shanker has since been viewed as a pioneer in teachers’ unions and educational reform.
