A reader from Minnesota says he will never support her candidacy because her actions deprived his state of Al Franken.
Re “Gillibrand, Senate Advocate for Women’s Causes, Joins Presidential Race” (news article, Jan. 16): As a “yellow dog Democrat” I will never support Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for president. She led the charge that deprived Minnesota of Senator Al Franken without due process. While #MeToo may be good politics, let us at least have evidence and hearings before we put people in front of political firing squads.
Mr. Franken was the most effective spokesman for this state in recent memory. We needed him in the Senate. Especially with Donald Trump as president, we do not need any more “off with their heads” attitudes in national politics. Ms. Gillibrand, go away.
