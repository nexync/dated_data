In a recent documentary, the geneticist doubled down on comments he made a decade ago, then apologized for, regarding race, genetics and intelligence.
For the past decade the laboratory, like much of the scientific community, has engaged in a delicate balancing act with regard to Dr. Watson: holding him at arm’s length for reinforcing unfounded racial stereotypes, while still honoring him for his contributions to science. Dr. Watson, with Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin, helped discover the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953, and he went on to help to shape the subsequent revolution in molecular biology.
But his recent comments “effectively reverse the written apology and retraction Dr. Watson made in 2007,” and “require the severing of any remaining vestiges of his involvement,” Cold Spring Harbor’s chief executive, Bruce Stillman, and its board of trustees chairwoman, Marilyn Simons, said in a statement.
Dr. Watson’s new comments came in an on-camera interview with Mark Mannucci, the producer of a documentary that aired last week on PBS as part of its “American Masters” series, which profiles individuals who have made a major contribution to American culture. In the film, Dr. Watson references a view that average I.Q. differences between blacks and whites reflect underlying genetic differences shaped by natural selection.
But leading geneticists say that even modern DNA studies are currently unable to validate such hypotheses about differences between human populations.
Mr. Mannucci said he had made it clear to Dr. Watson from the outset that the film would address the controversy over his 2007 remarks. Dr. Watson is recovering from a car accident, and his family members did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Michael Wigler, a veteran molecular biologist at the laboratory, said that Dr. Watson’s views on race were not newsworthy in the first place.
