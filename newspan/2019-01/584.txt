The European Union sanctioned on Monday two senior Russian military intelligence officials and two of their officers blamed for poisoning a former Russian double agent in Britain last year, a decision Moscow dismissed as groundless.
The European Union’s travel bans and asset freezes included two men Britain has named as intelligence officers, Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who are accused of attempting to murder the former spy, Sergei V. Skripal. His daughter was also poisoned.
The men have denied any involvement in the spraying of a chemical weapon on Mr. Skripal’s front door in Salisbury, England, in March.
In response to the case, which has widened the already large diplomatic gulf between Russia and the West, the European bloc also sanctioned the head and deputy head of Russia’s military intelligence agency, the G.R.U., Igor Olegovich Kostyukov and Vladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev.
“These designations include the two G.R.U. officials, and the head and deputy head of the G.R.U. responsible for possession, transport and use in Salisbury of a toxic nerve agent,” the European Union said in a statement after foreign ministers approved the move.
The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, rejected the decision.
Mr. Skripal, 66, a former colonel in Russia’s military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain, and his daughter, Yulia, were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury on March 4.
Britain published video images of the two Russians accused in the case visiting Salisbury at the time of the assassination attempt. The men have claimed they were innocent tourists visiting Salisbury’s cathedral.
Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius of Lithuania said the sanctions were meant to send a message to Moscow.
