There’s nothing special about the egg. Seems like a fine enough egg. But more than 35 million people have liked it, dethroning Kylie Jenner’s birth-announcement post.
But on Sunday night, a photo of an egg, orange and lightly freckled, beat out Kylie Jenner’s birth announcement as the most-liked Instagram post ever. By Monday it had doubled it in likes.
That’s it. That’s the egg more than 35 million accounts have liked as of Monday, when it was still gaining likes at a rapid pace.
Still, you would scoff at the cultural significance of the egg at your own peril. For perspective: Last year’s top television show in the United States, “Roseanne,” averaged 20 million viewers per week, and about 27 million watched the Oscars. If everyone who liked the photo created a new city, it would be the world’s largest by several million. The egg’s fans have passed the population of Canada.
