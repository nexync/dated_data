The opening night of New York City Ballet’s winter season was hours away, and several dancers were trying to perfect their lines onstage at the David H. Koch Theater. As they danced, a work crew just outside the auditorium struggled with another kind of line.
The crew was covering the floor of the theater’s airy promenade with a 127-foot-wide line drawing by Shantell Martin, the featured artist in City Ballet’s annual art series, which transforms the theater and aims to attract new audiences to dance.
Line is at the heart of Ms. Martin’s work. And line, in another sense, forms the core of ballet. As the dancers and the artist got ready on Tuesday afternoon, they tried to explain.
With its art series, City Ballet is trying to present ballet to audiences that may not have been exposed to it before — luring them with three special art-themed performances (all tickets are just $35), followed by parties. In past years, the artist JR covered the promenade with a collage of photos of dancers, and Jihan Zencirli (a.k.a. Geronimo) flooded it with colorful balloons.
It has been effective: The art series has attracted 20,000 newcomers to City Ballet, the company said, and 17 percent of those newbies returned for other ballet performances.
To prepare this year, Ms. Martin, who was born in London and is now based in New York, spent several days at the theater drawing as she watched rehearsals. It was not her first time drawing to music and dance: Early in her career, she said, she drew in nightclubs in Japan.
Maria Kowroski, a principal dancer, said it was not easy to answer.
The blown-up drawing was printed out on 60 sticky-backed vinyl panels. As Ms. Martin looked on, the workers stuck the disjointed panels to the floor, smoothed out the air bubbles, and tried to make her long, sinuous lines appear seamless.
