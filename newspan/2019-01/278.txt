A California taxpayers group says the 1978 voter initiative is not to blame for school funding.
“The Big Stakes in a Teachers’ Strike,” by Miriam Pawel (Op-Ed, Jan. 15), asserts that Proposition 13, a 1978 California voter initiative, “crippled” school districts’ ability to raise funds, saying Prop 13 is the reason “state government assumed control of allocating money to schools.” I strongly disagree.
California is now spending 30 percent more per student in inflation-adjusted dollars than it did in the mid-70s, a period when liberals and conservatives agreed that California schools were top-notch.
School funding in California changed before 1978 as a result of a state court case, Serrano v. Priest, in the early 1970s. The courts held that school funding had to be equalized across districts, which took local financial decisions out of the hands of local school boards. That’s why Sacramento assumed control of allocating education dollars.
Proposition 13, a much-needed restraint on yearly property tax increases, is not to blame for the failures and excesses of California politicians.
