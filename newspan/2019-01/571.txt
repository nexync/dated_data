Capitals Fans Give Barry Trotz Cheers. Islanders Give Him First Place.
WASHINGTON — Barry Trotz returned to his old home arena to face the team he coached to the Stanley Cup. He left with his new team in first place.
Trotz’s Islanders beat the defending champion Washington Capitals, 2-0, on Friday night to win their fourth in a row and leapfrog his former team into first place in the Metropolitan Division. In true Trotz fashion, the Islanders suffocated the Capitals to win for the 14th time in 17 games.
Josh Bailey and Cal Clutterbuck scored third-period goals and Thomas Greiss made 19 saves for his second shutout of the season, helping the Islanders improve to 7-0-0 in the second half of back-to-back sets this season.
Clutterbuck scored on a two-man breakaway just 2:26 later.
The Capitals have hit a rough patch under their new coach, Todd Reirden, losing four in a row for the first time since March 2017. Washington has just one five-on-five goal during its skid and has lost seven of 10.
Washington goaltender Braden Holtby was sharp in stopping 23 of the 25 shots he faced in his first game since his left eye was injured on a high stick on Saturday.
Trotz, 56, was honored with a video tribute during the first period. Even though he faced the Capitals at Barclays Center earlier this season — he received his Stanley Cup ring, as did the assistant Lane Lambert and Mitch Korn, the director of goaltending — Trotz expected another emotional night being back in Washington.
Fans gave Trotz a lengthy standing ovation throughout the video, which summed up his four years in Washington, from when he was hired to the lifting of the Cup in Las Vegas. He left the Capitals in a contract dispute in June, was hired by the Islanders days later and was replaced by Reirden, a longtime assistant.
