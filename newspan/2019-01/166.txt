Maura Carey Whang and Deegan Ross McClung were married Jan. 5 at the Marigny Opera House, an arts and events space in New Orleans. Paola J. Martinez, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the occasion, officiated.
Ms. Whang, 36, is a candidate for a master’s degree in historic preservation at Columbia. She graduated from Middlebury College and received a master’s degree in architecture from City College.
She is the daughter of Eileen McCoy Whang and KyuJung Whang of Princeton, N.J. The bride’s father is the vice president for facilities at Princeton University. Her mother retired as the work-life consultant in the human resources department at Cornell.
Mr. McClung, 42, is the executive chef at Sadelle’s, a New York restaurant.
He is a son of Barbara Ross McClung and Daniel F. McClung of New Orleans. The groom’s father retired as the senior partner at Campaign Strategies, a Houston consultancy for Democratic candidates for national political office.
The couple met in 2011 at the Momofuku Noodle Bar in the East Village, where she was a hostess, when he came in to see one of her colleagues. Several months later, they had their first meaningful interaction at an East Village bar, when she recognized him as the well-remembered friend-of-a-friend and struck up a conversation with him.
