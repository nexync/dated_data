LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Eun-Hee Ji of South Korea left the mistakes to everyone else down the stretch in the L.P.G.A. Tour season opener.
Ji overcame a strong wind and temperatures in the 50s on Sunday, making three birdies on the back nine as she pulled away and closed with a one-under-par 70 for a two-shot victory in the Tournament of Champions.
Ji got her mistakes out of the way early, opening with two bogeys and falling behind Lydia Ko of New Zealand. She took the lead for good with a birdie on the 10th hole at Tranquilo Golf Club at Four Seasons.
Ko was one shot behind when she pulled her tee shot on the par-5 13th, and she then compounded the error with a three-putt for a double bogey. Ko made double bogey on the closing hole for a 42 on the back nine and a 77.
Ji finished at 14-under 270 and won by two over her countrywoman Mirim Lee, who made only one bogey in her round of 68. Nelly Korda (71) finished third at 11 under.
Stacy Lewis, in her first competition as a mother, shot a 70 and tied for sixth with Brooke Henderson of Canada (75). Ariya Jutanugarn of Thailand, the top-ranked player in women’s golf, went into the weekend two shots out of the lead and closed with two 75s, tying for 18th. Her sister, Moriya Jutanugarn, managed a bogey-free round for a 69, tying for fourth at 10 under with Shanshan Feng of China (70).
The event was limited to tour winners from the past two seasons. It included a celebrity field of athletes and entertainers who competed for a $500,000 purse using the modified Stableford system. The Hall of Famer John Smoltz had 33 points in the final round for a three-point victory over Mark Mulder, another former pitcher.
