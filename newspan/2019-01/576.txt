Director X took Gordon Parks Jr.’s 1972 blaxploitation movie about a man trying to leave the drug world and updated it for the cryptocurrency and Black Lives Matter age in this remake. Trevor Jackson stars as Youngblood Priest, with Jason Mitchell as his second in command and Michael Kenneth Williams as his disquieting martial-arts enthusiast of a mentor.

YOUNG WINSTON (1972) 10 p.m. on TCM. The early exploits of Winston Churchill are explored in this Richard Attenborough-directed film, which casts Simon Ward as the near-mythologic British politician.
