The Learning Network|How Resilient Are You?
When was the last time you faced failure, rejection or adversity? How did you handle the situation? Does it still bother you or were you able to deal with it and move on?
We’ve all flopped on a big presentation.
After weeks of careful preparation and practice, you feel ready to knock it out of the park. But the day comes and, for whatever reason, every joke seems to fall flat, you bumble through all your numbers and your technology seems to be working against you.
Even though most people prefer to process failure internally and quickly move on for fear of causing a scene or seeming unprofessional, taking the time to reflect on and communicate about unwanted outcomes can go a long way in creating more congenial, trusting and ultimately productive workplaces.
But first, we have to talk about it.
— How resilient are you when it comes to dealing with setbacks or challenges? Are you able to accept the outcome, process it and move on? Or do you tend to dwell on what went wrong?
— After reading this article, are you convinced that talking about your failures would make you happier and more productive in the future? Why or why not?
— Have you ever shared your struggles with a friend or trusted adult, or has anyone ever opened up to you about their challenges? If so, what was this experience like? Did you learn anything from it? Did you find it helpful? Why or why not?
— What role do you think social media plays in our inability to admit defeat? In your opinion, does social media make us more or less resilient? Why?
— Can you recall a time when you were able to successfully overcome a failure or challenge? How did you do it? What advice do you have for others who are facing tough times?
