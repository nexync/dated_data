The Michael Jackson musical is taking its first steps onto the dance floor.
The show’s producers announced Wednesday that the project, now titled “Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough,” will have an initial production this fall in Chicago, running Oct. 29 to Dec. 1 at the James M. Nederlander Theater.
The musical is being produced by the Michael Jackson Estate and Columbia Live Stage, and the producers said they are aiming to bring it to Broadway next year.
Jackson’s life has been the subject of numerous examinations, some less flattering than others. Up next: “Leaving Neverland,” a documentary about abuse allegations against the pop star, which is screening at Sundance, and which the Jackson estate has denounced.
