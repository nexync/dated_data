During an interview with the comedian Kevin Hart broadcast on Friday, Ellen DeGeneres offered a lengthy defense of Hart and said that she called someone at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to request that he be reinstated as Oscars host. Almost a month ago, Hart stepped down from that role after a backlash over past comments he had made that were considered homophobic.
It’s unclear whom DeGeneres spoke to. The academy did not respond to a request for comment and has not announced a replacement host for Hart.
But Hart, who was also promoting his new movie “The Upside,” also said the campaign to have him ousted as Oscars host was meant to “destroy” him.
He told DeGeneres that he was re-evaluating whether to host the Oscars (it’s unclear if that decision is up to him). But on Friday, Variety posted an interview it conducted with Hart, before he had spoken to DeGeneres, in which he shut the door on ever hosting the Oscars.
Hart stepped down as Oscars host two days after it was announced that he got the job. Hosting was one of his top career goals, he told DeGeneres, because “there hasn’t been a lot of African-American comedians that have been able to do it.” As old comments resurfaced, Hart was initially defiant, declining to apologize.
But six hours later, he stepped down.
In the interview, DeGeneres, who is one of the most prominent gay celebrities working today and has also hosted the Academy Awards, played down the criticism that emerged over Hart hosting the ceremony. The interview was originally going to air this coming Monday, but the show decided to broadcast it on Friday.
