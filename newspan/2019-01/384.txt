Sales of the British standby have soared so much that the country added it back to the basket of goods it uses to measure inflation. Now, distillers are looking to reach a global cocktail crowd.
After surging for a decade, gin sales in Britain reached nearly 2 billion pounds, or about $2.6 billion, through last fall, compared with £1.26 billion for the same period in 2017, according to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. Drinkers of pink and flavored versions have helped make it the country’s second-most-popular spirit, ahead of whiskeys and behind only vodka, the group said.
Gin has become so popular in Britain that the Office for National Statistics added it back to the basket of goods it uses to measure inflation, after a 13-year absence.
