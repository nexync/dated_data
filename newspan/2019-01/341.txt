Squint and this week’s Billboard album chart looks almost identical to last week’s, as the rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie holds at No. 1 and most of rest of the Top 10 is just slightly reshuffled.
With no major new releases to compete with, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie’s “Hoodie SZN” holds the top spot for a second week with the equivalent of 56,000 sales in the United States, down 4 percent from last week, according to Nielsen. The breakdown of that number is also almost identical to that of last week, with 81 million streams and fewer than 1,000 copies sold as a complete album.
Also this week, the soundtrack to “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” featuring Post Malone, Juice WRLD and Nicki Minaj, among others, rose one spot to No. 2, swapping places with 21 Savage’s “I Am > I Was,” which fell one rung to No. 3. Post Malone’s “Beerbongs & Bentleys” is No. 4, and Meek Mill’s “Championships” is in fifth place.
