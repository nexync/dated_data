Canada opposes the death penalty and carried out its last execution in 1962. Its minister for foreign affairs, Chrystia Freeland, said on Tuesday that her ministry had already asked for clemency for Mr. Schellenberg.
She told reporters on Tuesday that Canada’s relationship with China was at “a complicated, a difficult moment,” and that she had spoken twice with the Chinese ambassador.
Ms Freeland said she had also had an “emotional” conversation over the phone with Mr. Schellenberg’s father.
“It’s important for us to remember that we’re talking about a human being — about a person,” she said.
Court records indicated that the police had found drugs in Mr. Schellenberg’s apartment, which a judge said he was using “as a distribution center,” saying he was “not at the lower rung of the dial-a-dope operations.” Mr. Schellenberg was sentenced to two years in jail, some of which he had already served while waiting for the trial.
On Tuesday, China struck back. Its embassy in Ottawa urged Chinese citizens to “fully assess the risks of traveling to Canada,” citing the "arbitrary detention” of Ms. Meng, though it did not name her. “In the near future, exercise caution in traveling to Canada,” the notice said.
On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hua Chunying, said that the Canadian government had played down the gravity of Mr. Schellenberg’s crime, which the court said involved attempting to smuggle nearly 500 pounds of methamphetamine to Australia. Ms. Hua also brushed aside the call for clemency.
