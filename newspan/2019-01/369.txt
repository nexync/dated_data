A 7-year-old who was riding in a car with her mother and three sisters was killed in Texas over the weekend, the authorities said, when a gunman in a pickup truck suddenly pulled up alongside them and opened fire.
The authorities, who said the shooting appeared random and unprovoked, were searching Monday for her killer.
The 7-year-old, Jazmine Barnes, was a second grader at a Houston-area elementary school, and her death — in the family’s car, early one morning over the holidays — unnerved and perplexed her community.
Jazmine was riding with her mother and sisters, a 6-year-old and two teenagers, near Houston when they were attacked in a “random and senseless” shooting about 7 a.m. Sunday, Sheriff Gonzalez said.
Jazmine’s mother, LaPorsha Washington, 30, told ABC13 that she and her family had been on a trip to get coffee when a man in a truck opened fire.
After the shooting, she said, one of her other daughters realized that Jazmine had been struck.
Jazmine was pronounced dead at the scene, the sheriff said. Ms. Washington was shot in the arm and her 6-year-old daughter suffered injuries from broken glass, the authorities said.
The authorities described the gunman as a white man in his 40s with a beard, wearing a red, hooded sweatshirt and driving a red pickup truck.
The image of a white man suddenly firing on a black family raised questions about whether the shooting had been racially motivated. Sheriff Gonzalez said the authorities had not established a motive and could not discount the possibility of a hate crime.
“We’re not ruling anything out and we’re not going to speculate,” he said.
His office has released a grainy image of a red pickup truck and is asking for the public’s help to find the gunman.
