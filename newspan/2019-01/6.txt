The New York Times podcast “The Daily” is starting a weekly newsletter that’ll be delivered to your inbox on Fridays. The host, Michael Barbaro, and the team behind the show give an exclusive look at how one of the week’s most talked-about stories on “The Daily” came together.
What’s in the newsletter?
You’ll get letters from Michael (like this one) that take you behind the scenes of “The Daily,” with a view into how stories are chosen, what happens when there’s late-breaking news and what gets left on the cutting-room floor. You’ll hear from the reporters and audio producers who bring these stories to life, and you’ll also have a voice in the newsletter, which will regularly feature comments and critiques from our listeners. There will be podcast recommendations and — just maybe — the occasional team photo.
Where can I sign up?
