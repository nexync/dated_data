Cary Blanchard, a clutch place-kicker who played for the Giants and the Jets and helped the Indianapolis Colts reach the American Football Conference championship game in January 1996, died on Sept. 6 in Gun Barrel City, Tex. He was 47.
His death was announced on the website of Oklahoma State University, where Blanchard was a standout player in college. Mindi Blanchard, his ex-wife, said the cause was a heart attack.
Blanchard scored 331 points and was a three-time all-Big Eight selection at Oklahoma State before starting his National Football League career with the Jets in 1992. Replacing Jason Staurovsky after the Jets had lost four games, he debuted on a night dedicated to honoring Pat Leahy, a kicker who had spent his entire 18-year career with the team and had recently retired.
“I hope I can have the kind of career” Leahy had, Blanchard told Newsday.
Blanchard’s career was not so stable. He was waived repeatedly and was a member of several teams, playing his last game in 2000.
That Pro Bowl appearance, for the 1996 season, was his only one. (He spent one more season with Indianapolis before the coaching switch.) But Blanchard, who made 165 field goals in his N.F.L. career, with a 77.1 percent conversion rate, often had a decisive impact on key games.
In 1993, he scored the only points in the Jets’ first shutout in 11 years, a 6-0 victory over the New England Patriots. In 1999 he helped the Giants beat the Buffalo Bills, 19-17, by hitting all four of his field-goal attempts and nailing a 48-yarder with less than a minute remaining.
Blanchard joined the Colts in 1995 and had his greatest success with them. That season, he kicked four field goals in a game against the San Francisco 49ers, the last a 41-yarder for an 18-17 win, and he helped the Colts rally from a 24-3 halftime deficit to beat the Miami Dolphins, 27-24, with an overtime field goal.
The Colts went deep into the playoffs, eventually losing in the A.F.C. championship game to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 20-16. Blanchard hit three of four field-goal attempts in that game.
In 1996, Blanchard posted a career-best 90 percent conversion rate with the Colts and made three field goals in a single quarter against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Colts made the playoffs that year, but they were thrashed by the Steelers, 42-14, in the wild-card round. In that season’s Pro Bowl, Blanchard won the game for the A.F.C. with a 37-yard overtime field goal.
He hit 54-yard field goals with the Washington Redskins in 1998 and the Arizona Cardinals in 2000. The Cardinals placed him on injured reserve before the 2001 season began.
Robert Cary Blanchard was born on Nov. 5, 1968, in Fort Worth. He made his first field goal and extra point on a Texas peewee team when he was just 6.
He is survived by his father, Robert; a sister, Kelly Evans; two sons, Blake and Braeden; and a daughter, Bayli Blanchard.
“But they also added, ‘Don’t miss the next one,’ ” he said.
