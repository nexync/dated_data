Now that we’ve watched the third season of “Transparent” — and sobbed over Shelly’s cabaret rendition of Alanis Morissette’s “Hand in My Pocket” from the finale — it’s time to take stock of yet another season of the Pfeffermans’ ceaseless navel-gazing.
Season 3 was the show’s most formally innovative to date, with surreal hallucination sequences, a turtle guest star and two stand-alone episodes to counteract binge-viewing fatigue: The gorgeous premiere and “If I Were a Bell,” which followed Maura and Shelly from childhood to courtship.
While the season explored new stylistic terrain, most characters got stuck in a holding pattern. Maura pursued gender confirmation surgery, only to learn that her heart wasn’t strong enough for it. Disillusioned with the music industry and shocked by Rita’s suicide, Josh made a second unsuccessful attempt to be a real father to Colton. Sarah entertained the possibility that her ex-husband, Len, really was her “person” after all.
Sarah’s love life was more promising than most. Poor Shelly had to dump Buzzy after she caught him in an egregious lie. Josh’s road trip with Shea heated up fast, until she realized he only wanted a fling. A tense evening at Bryna’s finished off Maura and Vicki. By the end of the season, every Pfefferman was single except for Ali, whose relationship with Leslie was on life support when the family reunited for a cruise in the final episode.
But ideas have always been at least as important as plot points in this show, and these ten episodes also tackled some of the show’s weightiest themes so far: intersectionality, religion, and death.
After Maura got a glimpse into the lives of less-privileged transgender women in the season premiere, Ali’s teaching assistant gig provided a believable setting for a discussion of intersectionality, or how different forms of oppression do and don’t intersect. From there, we watched the concept play out in the characters’ daily lives. Leslie, a radical lesbian writer, could not see that a Jewish celebration wasn’t the right time to complain about Israel. And you could almost hear the needle scratch at Maura’s birthday party when Shelly announced: “I too have transitioned. I’m coming out.” The speech doubled as a self-aware nod from the show’s creator, Jill Soloway, who co-wrote the episode with her sister Faith Soloway and is, herself, a cisgender woman telling her own trans parent’s story.
Shelly wasn’t the only character to appropriate someone else’s identity. Sarah made Judaism the focus of her endless search for meaning, finally driving the genuinely religious Raquel to berate her for conflating religion with self-help.
But there were moments of religious transcendence scattered throughout the season. Raquel delivered sermons and visited the mikvah, a ritual bath said to restore a Jew’s purity. Ali and Sarah hosted a makeshift Passover Seder on the cruise ship. With its emphasis on this life over the afterlife, Judaism couldn’t offer the eternal salvation that Colton’s Christian church promised Josh, but it did bring the family together for some traditional Jewish real talk.
Judaism’s vague conception of what happens after death also seemed to fuel Maura’s surgery crisis. As she turned 70 and observed her mother’s bleak final days, she had to confront the possibility that her body would never represent her true self — not on Earth, and not in eternity. When Josh poured Rita’s ashes into the ocean in the finale, it was as though he were liberating the entire family from the specter of death. The journey from this life to the next is often depicted as a boat trip, and I think that same symbolism is woven into the final episode.
“Transparent” was renewed in May for a fourth season, and although the Pfeffermans exhaust me, I’ll certainly be back for more. How about you? Let’s discuss.
• Which episode this season was your favorite? I’m going with “To Sardines and Back,” a.k.a., “The Nacho Episode.” The story of the Pfeffermans’ pet turtle, who resurfaces after disappearing into their ventilation system in the early ‘90s, was a fresh way of registering the passage of time. Taken together with Nacho’s escape from the kiddie pool several episodes later, it also felt like a case study in how poorly this clan treats even the animals it loves. It was fun to see the entire cast together at Maura’s birthday party, too.
• This season’s Most Valuable Pfefferman was Sarah. Her mix of intensity and self-absorption has made her pretty hard to watch, especially in Season 1. This season, though, I was struck by the revelation that her bossiness was a way of overcompensating for fears of rejection that dated back to childhood. Sarah has become a more complicated character, and Amy Landecker’s portrayal of her has evolved to accommodate that nuance. Whose Season 3 story resonated the most with you?
• It was nice to see “Transparent” give Shelly some additional depth and give Judith Light some challenging material. As the character herself noted in the finale, Shelly is often relegated to a punch line, the Barbra Streisand-loving condo dweller in a family of sophisticates. By the time she belted out that Alanis cover, we had learned she was an abuse survivor and watched her stand up for herself with Buzzy. Who could help but applaud her journey “To Shel and Back”?
• Speaking of Shelly, how did you feel about her and Maura’s origin stories? I loved the softly lit look of “If I Were a Bell,” directed by Andrea Arnold (“Fish Tank”), which evoked photo albums and home movies without resorting to a Super-8 effect. And it was a nice touch to imply that each character could sense the other’s traumatic history. One small complaint: Although it was great to see Michaela Watkins and Michael Stuhlbarg back as Maura’s grandparents, the story of Maura’s secret dress-up bunker felt a bit predictable.
• Josh and Ali’s increasingly codependent relationship was the story line that surprised me the most. It didn’t make sense that Ali, in the throes of a new relationship and a new career, would devote so much attention to her unmoored brother — until her fear of falling in love with Leslie came into focus in the last few episodes. In retrospect, this looks more like an effective slow burn than a plot hole to me.
• Can we talk about Ali’s laughing gas trips? Those dizzyingly bright “Wheel of Fortune” scenes could have come straight out of “Requiem for a Dream.” But Caitlyn Jenner’s brief appearance as a contestant felt like a throwaway.
• As is inevitably the case with an ensemble show, there are a few characters I wish had gotten more screen time. Especially since Elizah never resurfaced, it would have been nice to hear more from the two recurring transgender characters who are actually played by transgender actresses: Shea, whose episode with Josh was a highlight, and Davina. I hope “Transparent” will eventually take us deeper into Bryna’s story, too.
• I’m worried we won’t see much of Rabbi Raquel in Season 4. There was a certain finality to her last appearance of the season, that sublime moment in the mikvah. And now that she has broken up with Josh and blown up at Sarah, there’s nothing tying her to the Pfeffermans.
