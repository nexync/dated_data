Tom Brady of the New England Patriots is suspended for the season’s first four games, and Le’Veon Bell of the Pittsburgh Steelers is suspended for the first three. Tony Romo of the Dallas Cowboys will have an extended absence because of a back injury, and Teddy Bridgewater of the Minnesota Vikings is expected to miss the entire season with a severe knee injury.
Add that list of distinguished-yet-absent players to a season-opening Super Bowl rematch between the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos that failed to inspire, and the N.F.L. appears to be entering 2016 with things as wide open as they have been at any point in recent history.
The power vacuum will undoubtedly give teams like the Green Bay Packers and the Seattle Seahawks motivation to get off to a hot start, but optimism abounds even in the dark corners of the league like Jacksonville and Oakland, where two franchises that have been laughingstocks for years believe that meticulous planning may finally pay off with fewer moral victories and more actual victories.
The action on the field will have to work hard to compete with the drama off it, with concerns about player safety and ugly off-field episodes continuing to harm the league’s reputation. And for the time being, Colin Kaepernick, the backup quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, has overshadowed all of that by choosing not to stand during the national anthem in order to raise awareness of the treatment of minorities. Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, a college teammate of Kaepernick’s, knelt during the anthem on Thursday night, and everyone will be watching in Week 1 to see which players follow suit.
But once the anthems are finished, the jockeying for position will begin. The teams, all of which have to believe they are in the hunt, will go about trying to start their seasons 1-0.
Pittsburgh Steelers over Seattle Seahawks.
