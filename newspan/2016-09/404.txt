Zeisler’s piece was an interesting read, strongly pro-Clinton, and pro-feminist. But several readers took issue both with the headline and the editors’ decision to use it.
I did find the essay readable and smart, and given that the Op-Ed pages are intended to throw out the welcome mat to all views, it’s hard to argue that this wasn’t a worthy offering. But I too was jolted by the headline. Have we really reached the point that it’s O.K. for The Times to refer to Clinton in bold type as “The Bitch America Needs”?
Dry said she was unaware of a previous time when the word was used in a headline.
What bothered me about the headline was that it seemed to come from the voice of The Times, at least when you come on it cold, as all readers do. It’s one thing for an author, under her own byline and in the context of her ideas, to write the type of opinion piece Zeisler did. But the word bitch — particularly when it’s lobbed at you across a room or on the street or in social media — is surely intended as crude and demeaning. I suspect that’s the same way Trump supporters use it. And it seems to be the way the Clinton campaign takes it, as it has made clear in the past.
Dry says that when opinion editors write the headlines, they are distilling the author’s perspective, not the view or the voice of The Times.
That may be, but referring to the first female presidential nominee as the right bitch for the job brings an air of legitimacy to the word that seems beyond where we are at this moment in history. The mainstream may someday apply this term to women who stand up for themselves and bust through feminine stereotypes. Until then, it remains an insult, degrading and misogynistic.
