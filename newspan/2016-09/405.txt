“Once you’re following a track, you don’t know where you’re going to end up, which is part of the fun of it,” says Paul Rezendes, who has written two books about animal tracking. One to two inches of new snow make for optimal conditions; in deeper snow, animal footprints may appear as indistinguishable holes. Sandy or muddy substrates like riverbanks hold prints, too, but don’t bother with forest floors blanketed in leaves or pine needles. “If you have a nice fresh snow, you can track an animal all day, come back the next day and pick up where you left off,” Rezendes says. Snow can help prevent your getting lost too, by allowing you to trace your own imprints back to your starting point.
Bring along a guide to animal tracks, a measuring tape, a map, a compass and the know-how to use them. Or, if you’re confident in your phone’s battery life and signal, navigate using a GPS-based topographic app.
Start by tracking something easy, like a deer or a red fox, which is the most widely distributed carnivore in the world. While deer prints are very distinct, tracks from a red fox can be hard to differentiate from those of dogs and coyotes. (Unlike most other canids, however, foxes tend to walk in straight lines.) Concentrate on the impressions left by an animal’s feet but also watch for what Rezendes calls “signs”— scrapes left in tree bark, munched foliage, the bloody carcasses of prey, excrement (called “scat” in animal tracking), the presence or absence of favored forage plants. Catching an animal is not the point. “Tracking is about becoming intimate with animals’ lives,” Rezendes says. If an animal knows you’re there, the only behavior you’ll read in its footprints is that of a creature being stalked. Sometimes trackers are also hunters, but Rezendes stopped shooting wildlife in his youth.
