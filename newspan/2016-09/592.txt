While Donald J. Trump resists making his tax returns public, his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, released a decade of his own filings on Friday.
The returns reflected Mr. Pence’s government salaries as governor and, earlier, as a member of the House of Representatives. In 2015, Mr. Pence and his wife, Karen, reported adjusted gross income of $113,026, paying federal taxes of $8,956 and contributing $8,923 to charities.
In 2015, Mr. Pence, the governor of Indiana and the Republican vice-presidential nominee, and his wife, Karen, reported an adjusted gross income of $113,026, paid $8,956 in federal taxes and contributed $8,923 to charities.
Candidates are not required to release their tax returns, but if Mr. Trump does not disclose them before the election, he would be the first major-party presidential nominee not to do so in four decades. Mr. Trump has submitted the required personal financial disclosure form, which includes details of his business interests.
Mr. Pence on Friday also released his own personal financial disclosure, which showed his state pension, a few investments and a series of loans totaling more than $80,000 for his children’s education.
On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine made public their tax data last month.
