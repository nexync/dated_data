After one final, wildly wayward forehand return by Jack Sock, the American male population in the United States Open singles bracket was reduced to an all-too-familiar zero. Zilch, once again.
Ninth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated Sock, 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (7), 6-2, in the fourth round on Sunday, which left Serena and Venus Williams as the last American players in either singles draw. Time stands still at Flushing Meadows, where the men stumble while the Williams sisters remain the American mainstays.
Sock, the No. 26 seed, had his moments inside the packed Louis Armstrong Stadium, as he usually does, particularly in the taut third-set tiebreaker when he was down two sets to none. He rifled two forehands down the line to clinch the tiebreaker, as an invigorated crowd chanted his name.
Whatever momentum he might have gained, however, quickly dissipated in the third game of the fourth set, when he gave Tsonga a break at love with a netted forehand and two double faults.
The unraveling was immediate. Sock was broken again with a netted forehand under pressure in the fifth game, and the more realistic fans filed out on the changeover at 4-1. The match, which lasted 3 hours 14 minutes, ended soon after.
Tsonga will next face either top-seeded Novak Djokovic or the unseeded Kyle Edmund, who were scheduled to play each other later Sunday night.
Sock’s problem remains simple enough, though difficult to cure. His backhand is a defensive tool, not a weapon. He runs around that side whenever possible to set up his laser forehand, but that leaves him in awkward positions and often too far wide off the court. He either finishes the point with an inside-out forehand winner or finds himself at a disadvantage on the next shot.
Tsonga has the same technique, though he tends to stay a bit closer to the lines on his runabouts. He also noted other differences: Sock plays with more spin, with more kick on his serves. Still, the statistical similarities were evident. Sock struck only four winners on his backhand, compared with 20 on his forehand. Tsonga had no backhand winners and 26 forehand winners.
So this was an oddly skewed match: two players, each desperately trying to play to the other’s backhand while dashing to his left to avoid his own backhand whenever possible.
There is real hope for Sock, who could yet have a Tsonga-like career in front of him. He is still young at 23, and he is already ranked 27th in the world. Sock had a couple of notable victories here, particularly his unexpected straight-sets dismantling of Marin Cilic in the third round. The flawed backhand stroke, however, may well sabotage any aspirations for major victories. Tsonga, 31, has never climbed that mountain in his long career.
Sock said he just needed to piece together a few things on the court.
It has been five years since an American man advanced to the quarterfinals at the Open; Andy Roddick and John Isner reached that round in 2011. Isner and Donald Young were knocked out in the fourth round last year. In 2014, Sam Querrey and Isner were ousted in the third round.
So this was not an unexpected result, but further evidence that the American men still have a considerable road ahead of them. Promising young players come and go, but countries such as Britain, France and Canada are producing top-10 candidates at a more rapid clip.
The New York fans once again showed they were ready for a fresh new hope.
The backhand is not.
