Chris Bosh, an 11-time All-Star, failed his preseason physical and was not cleared to participate in the Miami Heat’s training camp, the Heat said Friday.
Bosh’s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bosh has done interviews in recent weeks with Uninterrupted, LeBron James’s digital platform, saying in one that “nothing” would keep him off the court this season though blood clots ended each of his last two seasons at the All-Star break. “I’m ready to play,” Bosh, 32, said last week.
Bosh, the Heat’s highest-paid player, is owed nearly $76 million for the final three seasons of his contract. The money is guaranteed, but there are mechanisms in the league’s collective-bargaining agreement that would allow Miami to remove Bosh’s salary from its cap number sometime next year if he cannot continue to play.
GARNETT IS RETIRING Kevin Garnett has decided to retire after 21 seasons in the N.B.A. He posted a video on his Instagram account Friday saying “farewell” and “thank you for the journey.” The Minnesota Timberwolves will waive Garnett, allowing him to collect his $8 million salary for next season.
Garnett, 40, entered the league straight from high school and put the Timberwolves on the map by turning a hapless franchise into a perennial playoff team. He later helped return the Boston Celtics to glory, before finishing his career with the Brooklyn Nets and then the Wolves. He won the Most Valuable Player Award in 2004. Garnett made more than $330 million in his career, the most by any player in league history.
