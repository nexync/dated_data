In Gee Chun won the Evian Championship on Sunday at 21 under par — the best 72-hole finish in a major by a man or woman — after having missed the cut in the same tournament in Évian-les-Bains, France, last year.
Chun needed to sink a 10-foot par put on the 18th after sending her tee shot into the rough but captured her second career major after her caddie raised the stakes.

Chun, 22, shot a two-under 69 in the final round — her highest of the tournament by three strokes — for a 263, four strokes ahead of her South Korean countrywomen Sung Hyun Park and So Yeon Ryu.
