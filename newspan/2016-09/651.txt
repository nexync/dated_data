The actor and celebrity Alec Baldwin sued the art dealer Mary Boone in New York State Supreme Court on Monday, asserting in court papers that he had been defrauded in the purchase of a painting from Ms. Boone in 2010.
“The painting Ms. Boone delivered was not the authentic “Sea and Mirror” painting Mr. Baldwin had purchased and was not the painting Ms. Boone represented it was,” the filing said.
rejected Mr. Baldwin’s lawsuit as false and as an effort to intimidate Ms. Boone.
Mr. Baldwin first had questions about the painting after he bought it for $190,000 because when it arrived, it appeared brighter and had a different smell than he had expected, though Ms. Boone told him she had had it cleaned, according to the filing. In an earlier statement, Mr. Poretz indicated that Mr. Baldwin had been informed that he was getting a different version of “Sea and Mirror.” Mr. Baldwin has said he was never told.
The dispute, which has lifted a curtain on the often opaque New York art world, has pitted Mr. Baldwin, who occupies a central role in New York’s cultural life, against Ms. Boone, a prominent gallery owner who built her reputation in the 1980s.
