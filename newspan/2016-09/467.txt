Elizabeth LeCompte, the director of the experimental theater company the Wooster Group, has been awarded the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize, which is given annually to an artist who pushes the boundaries of an art form and contributes to social change.
The prize, established in 1994 through the will of the actress Lillian Gish, carries a cash award of about $300,000, making it one of the richest arts prizes in the United States. Previous winners include Suzan-Lori Parks, Anna Deavere Smith, Spike Lee, Frank Gehry, Bob Dylan and the lighting designer Jennifer Tipton, a longtime Wooster Group associate.
The group’s recent productions include “The Town Hall Affair,” based on Chris Hegedus and D.A. Pennebaker’s documentary about the famous 1971 public debate about feminism between Norman Mailer and four female writers, and “Early Shaker Spirituals,” about a 1976 record by Sisters of the Sabbathday Lake Shaker community.
The prize will be awarded in November in a private ceremony at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Ms. LeCompte, whose previous honors include MacArthur and Guggenheim fellowships, said in a statement that the prize was an affirmation of the work of the entire company.
