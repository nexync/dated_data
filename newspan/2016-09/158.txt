A government ministry said it was investigating a possible leak of industrial waste, but had not determined what caused the discoloration. One hint at the possible cause is the path the river, the Daldykan, takes past the Norilsk Nickel mine and metallurgical plant, by many measures one of the world’s most polluting enterprises. The plant belches so much acid rain-producing sulfur dioxide — two million tons a year, more than is produced in all of France — that it is surrounded by a dead zone of tree trunks and mud about twice the size of Rhode Island.
The metal smelters in this ore-rich region produce copious amounts of copper, one-fifth of the world’s nickel — a key alloy in stainless steel — and half of the global supply of palladium, a precious metal nearly as valuable as platinum.
The ore also contains iron, but that red-hued element is far less valuable than the precious metals extracted along with it, and is generally discarded in slurry ponds.
That iron slurry is the most likely source of the discoloration in the “blood river,” environmental groups and Russian environmental regulators said, attributing the red hue to iron oxide, better known as rust.
If so, while certainly shocking, the red water would be mostly harmless to humans, said Vladimir Chuprov, a researcher with Greenpeace in Russia. High concentrations could be fatal to fish.
The slurry, however, could be potentially more dangerous than it appears if it also contains traces of heavy metals created by the Norilsk smelters, which could damage the fragile Arctic environment, Mr. Chuprov said.
A photo of the river circulated on social media and in the Russian news media, but its authenticity could not be determined.
Absent any tests, he said, Greenpeace could not say with certainty what turned the river red, or when.
