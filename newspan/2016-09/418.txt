For Danny DeVito, “The Price” is right.
“The Price,” which was first staged on Broadway in 1968, has been revived three times previously; this next revival will be presented by Roundabout Theater Company, and will also feature John Turturro (“The Night Of”), Tony Shalhoub (“Monk”) and Jessica Hecht (now onstage in “Fiddler on the Roof”). The production, directed by Terry Kinney, is to begin performances Feb. 16 and to open March 16 at the American Airlines Theater.
Mr. DeVito has performed Off Broadway, including at Shakespeare in the Park. In 2012, he starred in a London stage production of “The Sunshine Boys,” and in 2013, he reprised that role in Los Angeles.
