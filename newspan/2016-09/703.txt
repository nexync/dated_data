Popcast: What Will We Be Listening to This Fall?
This week, the pop music staff of The New York Times released its contribution to the annual Arts and Leisure Fall Preview. And yet, in this year particularly, that task was as slippery as it’s ever been.
First, there’s the part about “fall” — labels used to reliably stock the season with their biggest superstars, but that’s changed in the age of surprise releases. Several of pop’s biggest names — Beyoncé, Drake, Rihanna and more — have already released their 2016 albums.
And some who still might — looking at you, Taylor Swift — haven’t made any public indications of their intentions. That complicates the “preview” part of the plan. Even just a few years ago, labels planned their calendars many months in advance. But now, the cycle from first whiff of announcement to full release has been compressed. We know some of what’s happening in the coming months, but are likely to be surprised more than once by a big name looking to make a big splash.
In this increasingly unpredictable space, we selected about 100 albums from artists established and new to highlight. And this week on the Popcast, I was joined by the pop music editor Caryn Ganz, the chief pop music critic Jon Pareles, and the pop music reporter Joe Coscarelli to talk about some of our favorites (see below).
