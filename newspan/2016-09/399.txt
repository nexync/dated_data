“Chelsea has received word from the military that they are moving forward with the recommendation for surgery,” said Chase Strangio, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Strangio said that he did not know whether the Army had clarified who would pay for Ms. Manning’s treatment.
“The surgery was recommended back in April 2016,” she said. “The recommendations for my hair length were back in 2014.” As a result of the military’s decision, Mr. Strangio said, Ms. Manning ended a five-day hunger strike.
The decision to allow Ms. Manning to proceed with the surgery appeared to be emblematic of a gradual shift in the military’s position on transgender service members.
In February 2015, the Defense Department approved Ms. Manning’s request for hormone therapy. The next month, a military court recognized her as a woman.
Mr. Strangio said that Ms. Manning had been given “some indication” on Monday that a compromise might be worked out with respect to her treatment. On Tuesday, she was shown a treatment protocol that had a number of recommendations for her in writing, he said, confirming that a doctor’s recommendation from April that she be treated for gender dysphoria was being followed.
