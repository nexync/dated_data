Six formerly “lost” episodes of “Doctor Who” from the 1960s will return in animated form this fall.
“The Power of the Daleks,” a story with six episodes from 1966, was among many early installments of the beloved cult science-fiction series that the BBC later erased from its archives, thanks to the broadcaster’s then-common practice of recording over or otherwise discarding old programs. The master negatives of the “Power of the Daleks” shows were destroyed in an archive purge in 1974.
But now the BBC is producing an animated version of the story, which featured Patrick Troughton as the Doctor, based on surviving clips, photographs and audio recordings from the episodes. The new episodes will be available for streaming in England on Nov. 5 — exactly 50 years after the original version debuted. They will have their premiere on BBC America on Nov. 12 and be available the following day for streaming on that channel’s digital platforms.
The animated adaptation “is the most ambitious ‘Doctor Who’ archive restoration ever attempted,” Charles Norton, the producer and director of the new series, said in a statement.
