Issa Arnita, a spokesman for the private prison contractor, said on Thursday in a statement that Management and Training Corporation had “made tremendous improvements to overall operations” at Walnut Grove since it took over management in 2012.
But the 1,260-bed facility had been operating since 2012 under a federal consent decree for violating prisoners’ constitutional rights, and in 2014, Walnut Grove was the scene of two major riots.
Conditions in a number of Mississippi’s correctional facilities have been denounced by prison overhaul advocates or enjoined by the federal authorities for violating inmates’ constitutional rights, but Walnut Grove was cited as a particularly brutal, often lawless place.
“The sexual misconduct we found was among the worst that we have seen in any facility anywhere in the nation,” the report said.
“It was like walking out of a club and your clothes smell like smoke,” he said.
As an example of the close ties between the prison and the town, Walnut Grove’s mayor, William Grady Sims, served for a time as the prison’s warden.
