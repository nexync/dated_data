The Trump campaign has been complaining aggressively that the mainstream media is working against the candidacy of Donald J. Trump, who has recently been giving most of his interviews to conservative outlets. In an interview with a Philadelphia radio station on Wednesday, the younger Mr. Trump said that the media has built up Mrs. Clinton and that it is her No. 1 surrogate.
The comments come as the Trump campaign has faced criticism for failing to sufficiently disavow support from the so-called alt-right movement, a group widely considered white supremacists and who often express anti-Semitic views.
Last week, Donald Trump Jr. drew a backlash for pushing back against Mrs. Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment by posting on Instagram an image that included Pepe the Frog. The frog is a popular alt-right symbol.
The gas chamber comment was quickly picked up in the Israeli press and critics of Mr. Trump, such as the independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin, who said that the statement was revealing.
The Anti-Defamation League also scolded Donald Trump Jr. for showing a lack of sensitivity about the Holocaust.
The group, which works to combat anti-Semitism, called on him to retract his comment.
A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Jason Miller, said that Mr. Trump’s words were being twisted for political purposes. “Don Jr. was clearly referring to capital punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign,” Mr. Miller said.
Donald Trump Jr.’s sister, Ivanka, is a convert to Judaism.
