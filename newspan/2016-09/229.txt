A new gallery space within the Museum at Eldridge Street will open on Sunday with “Kaddish for Dabrowa Bialostocka,” 18 works by the artist Mark Podwal.
The gallery, called the Michael Weinstein Gallery, after the museum’s chairman, will allow the museum to present artwork and ephemera on themes that resonate with the landmark 1887 Eldridge Street Synagogue.
Other coming exhibitions include “The Jewish Ghetto in Postcards: From Eastern Europe to the Lower East Side,” featuring postcards from the Blavatnik Archive, and postcards of Eastern European synagogues from a private collector.
Mr. Podwal’s show was inspired by his mother’s birthplace in Poland, where Jews once made up 78 percent of the town’s population. Today, none remain.
