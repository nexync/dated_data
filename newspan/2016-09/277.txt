That he is now at the helm of a global brand like Berluti reflects the current change roiling the sector, which after a period of much-lauded growth seems to be casting around for a way to stay relevant.
In April, Brioni, a men’s wear brand owned by the Kering luxury group, appointed Justin O’Shea, an iconoclastic Australian with a retail background, as its designer. He is now in the midst of effecting what the New York Times critic Guy Trebay called “a radical brand reset” infused with a slick, 24-carat pimp gloss.
And it speaks to the growing convergence of the men’s and women’s wear worlds, as expressed both in the design and in the simultaneous presentation of the lines, normally shown months apart, at brands like Tom Ford, Burberry and Bottega Veneta. Earlier this year, a Louis Vuitton ad campaign featured the actor Jaden Smith in products from the women’s line.
He said he had begun speaking to Mr. Arnault, the oldest son of Bernard Arnault, the founder and chairman of LVMH, a few months ago.
He hired Alessandro Sartori from Z Zegna, the more fashion-forward line of the Ermenegildo Zegna behemoth; bought the custom French suitmaker Arnys in 2012, merging it with Berluti; and began to open stores.
By the time Mr. Sartori left early this year (he returned to Zegna as artistic director), Mr. Arnault told Women’s Wear Daily that revenues had grown to more than 100 million euros ($111.6 million), from under €30 million ($33.5 million). The brand now has 45 stores around the world.
The aesthetic Mr. Sartori created for Berluti was signified by a quirky classicism and built on a high luxury sneaker, so it is now up to Mr. Ackermann — a Colombian-born, African-raised, Paris-based graduate of the Belgian school of fashion with an affinity for leather — to redefine it.
