Locked in a tight race, both candidates are raising red flags with voters. Most voters think Donald J. Trump is a risky choice and does not have the temperament and personality to be president, but Hillary Clinton continues to struggle with broad perceptions that she is not trustworthy and cannot bring real change to Washington, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll found.
“I don’t think she’s been dishonest or untrustworthy in a way that disqualifies her to be president, but she shouldn’t have worried so much about political ramifications and come clean up front,” said Lindsay Dofelmier, 36, a lawyer in Houston who is supporting Mrs. Clinton.
Mr. Trump has yet to release any of his tax returns, a break with political tradition that goes back decades, and has been far less specific than Mrs. Clinton on many personal and political questions, including his policy proposals. Asked if it was necessary for Mr. Trump to release his tax returns, 59 percent of voters said it was. Forty-five percent of voters said they would like the candidates to release more medical records.
