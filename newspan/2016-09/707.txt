Of all the antidotes to Hillary Clinton’s recent stumble (literal and metaphorical) that could have appeared, the Michael Kors show is not the one that immediately leaps to mind.
Yet on Wednesday, that is exactly what it was: upbeat, full of optimism if not pantsuits. It was set to a live performance by Rufus Wainwright, who serenaded the models in the finale with “Forget your troubles, c’mon get happy,” punctuating the lyrics, and the looks, with “Go Hillary,” and otherwise giving the idea of getting ready for the judgment day a whole new meaning. Not to mention casting a new light on the sportswear on the runway.
Which was coming up daisies: gerberas, shastas and more, all in sunshine shades of aquamarine, new-leaf green, azalea and tangerine, printed on crepe de Chine and woven into jacquards, sequined on georgette and embroidered on cashmere.
Providing some fertilizer were 1940s bathing bombshell bikinis made for posing (a bra top is among the omnipresent trends of the season, though it’s not entirely clear why; ditto gingham, which Mr. Kors cut into a neat tailored coat). Plus boyfriend basics — slouching ribbed knits and cropped khakis culottes, crisp striped shirts and a wrap trench — and a navy pullover with a bouquet of three-dimensional flowers on the sleeves and the word “Love” on the front.
Maybe sometimes a bit of unironic enthusiasm in the form of an uncomplicated outfit really is all we need. Clichés become clichés because they work.
By the end of the show, every member of the very jaded fashion week audience had a helpless smile on their face. Zing went the strings of their hearts.
