I applaud law enforcement authorities for arresting someone in connection with the bombings in Manhattan and New Jersey so quickly (nytimes.com, Sept. 19). They will run every lead into the ground and round up any and all of his accomplices. We dodged a bullet on this one, as no one was killed.
Our best defense against these murderers is one another. Keep your eyes open. Pay attention to what is going on around you. Put the cellphone in your purse or pocket and pull the earbuds out of your ears. Look and listen.
The conduct of the individual or individuals who placed the explosive devices is appalling, but, thankfully, rare.
As James Comey, the F.B.I. director, has said, finding potential terrorists before they strike is like finding needles in a haystack, or, in some cases, figuring out which pieces of hay will become needles..
As for those who blame Democrats or liberals or President Obama for supposedly denying that there is such a thing as “radical Islam,” that reflects an inability to understand the rationale behind avoiding that phrase, which is to avoid conflating the very small percentage of Muslims who perpetrate these acts or promote terrorism with the majority of Muslims, who are most often the victims overseas.
That doesn’t mean that anyone is denying or misunderstanding the sources or roots of terrorism. The people at the business end of the drone strikes ordered by President Obama know better, even if his partisan critics don’t.
