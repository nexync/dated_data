When Judy Balint, the chief marketing officer at SmartBiz Loans, read a freelance article that her company’s president contributed to Entrepreneur.com last month, she was startled to see that a promotion for a rival lender had been added to the beginning — a lender with a partnership with Entrepreneur.
“Get the working capital your business needs from Entrepreneur Lending, powered by CAN Capital,” it read, with a link to more information.
A promotional message that was added to the top of a post written by the president of SmartBiz Loans for Entrepreneur.com. Late last week, after The New York Times contacted Entrepreneur about the tagline, it was removed.
When she complained, she said, she received an apology but was told the lines could not be removed or altered because of the way the post was tagged in the publishing system. The same promotional message was added to a slew of articles by journalists and contributors, some dating back as far as 2001, in a bid to draw readers to Entrepreneur’s new lending venture.
Late last week, after The New York Times contacted Entrepreneur about the promotion, the tagline was removed, and in some cases replaced with a more recognizable ad for Entrepreneur Lending at the bottom of the articles.
Publishers, under growing financial pressures in recent years, have increasingly blurred the lines between their organizations’ editorial and business sides to generate more money, whether through sponsored content that mimics the look and feel of reported work or by supporting conferences that feature leaders of businesses that their journalists cover. Entrepreneur Media, which owns Entrepreneur.com and Entrepreneur magazine, has entered new territory by joining the lending business, which it reports on, and using its editorial coverage to subtly promote its lending group.
Entrepreneur Media, which started in the 1970s and is based in Irvine, Calif., has always targeted people who own, or aspire to own, a small business, mostly with “how to” information through its monthly magazine, books, website and events.
The company, which is known for suing or threatening to sue anyone who infringes on its United States trademark for the word “entrepreneur,” says its flagship magazine has an advertising rate base of 600,000, compared with 700,000 at Inc.com and 900,000 at Forbes. Online, Entrepreneur.com had 5.7 million unique visitors in July, a 10 percent decline from the same month last year, compared with 74 million at Yahoo Finance and 9.7 million at Inc.com, according to comScore.
Last month, Entrepreneur Media introduced Entrepreneur Lending, which allows it to profit as it directs readers to short-term, high-rate loans from CAN Capital. It added taglines promoting the business at the start of a wide range of stories related to raising capital, which are either edited contributions from freelancers or produced by its own writers.
“Covering the spectrum of accurate and relevant information is an important part of our mission to support the small-business community and integral to the integrity of our brand,” wrote Mr. Shea, whose father was one of three men who took control of the company in 1987.
Mark Vamos, a professor of business journalism at Southern Methodist University, in Dallas, and a former editor of Fast Company magazine, said the potential for conflicts of interest was obvious. “How can you continue to be neutral when you’ve got skin in the game?” he said.
Before the original text was deleted from the stories, he said its placement was troubling for readers because it was not clearly distinguishable from the editorial content.
Bill Shaw, the chief revenue officer of Entrepreneur Media, declined to discuss the ads or terms of the company’s deal with CAN Capital. He pointed to Mr. Shea’s post from Aug. 16 as an example of the company’s “continued transparency” and said a similar note would be shared in the October issue of Entrepreneur magazine.
Mr. Shaw did not return messages seeking comment on why Entrepreneur removed the promotional tagline from the top of the stories.
Ms. Balint of SmartBiz said the promotion crossed a line.
“If they put it in a box and said ‘sponsored’ or ‘ad’ or something, it would certainly help, and then simply allowing the contributors to not have that right in front of their article,” she said.
Mr. Vamos said the company was taking the risk of losing contributors and eroding the value of its core business, which is ultimately the editorial product.
