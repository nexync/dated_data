A former teacher and debate coach at one of the city’s most competitive high schools pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan on Friday to one count of receiving child pornography.
The former teacher, Jon Cruz, resigned in March 2015 from the Bronx High School of Science. He was a popular figure at the school, where he was recognized as the tireless coach for the speech and debate team, which became a formidable national competitor under his leadership.
The charge carries a minimum prison term of five years and a maximum of 20. As part of the plea, the prosecution agreed to recommend a sentence of approximately 11 to 14 years. That range is just advisory, however, and Judge P. Kevin Castel of the Southern District of New York will sentence Mr. Cruz in January.
According to the United States attorney’s office, Mr. Cruz, 33, had multiple conversations on mobile apps and social media with at least five minors, from July 2014 through December 2015. He paid the minors to send him sexually explicit photographs.
During the proceeding, the courtroom was crowded with Mr. Cruz’s friends, relatives, former students and the parents of former students, about three dozen people in all who had come to support him.
