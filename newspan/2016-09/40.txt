The New York Philharmonic will open its 175th anniversary season on Wednesday a little differently than its forebears in 1842: For the first time it will stream the concert on Facebook Live.
The program, which will begin at 7:30 p.m. at David Geffen Hall, will feature Gershwin’s Concerto in F for piano and orchestra, John Corigliano’s “STOMP” and Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9, “From the New World.” It will mark the beginning of a season-long celebration of that symphony that the orchestra is calling the “New World Initiative,” inspired by citywide book programs that aim to get whole cities reading the same book.
The symphony, which Dvorak wrote in New York, was given its premiere by the Philharmonic in 1893. As part of this season’s exploration, the orchestra is asking ensembles to play it, or selections from it, or reinterpretations of it. The Philharmonic will advertise their performances at newworldinitiative.com; invite participating ensembles to attend open rehearsals; and give them access to arrangements, marked conducting scores, and sheet music notated by Philharmonic musicians.
More than 70 groups have joined so far, the orchestra said, including PUBLIQuartet, Emmanuel Baptist Church and the Bulgarian Children’s Chorus. The Philharmonic is also developing a curriculum exploring the work, including its African-American and Native American musical influences, and will present it to city music teachers in November.
