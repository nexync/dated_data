Jeffrey Wechsler returns with a theme that also combines these two things in a very funny way and with considerably fewer Nazis.
The name of the game today is knowing how to count in different languages. Mr. Wechsler has taken five common, two-word phrases and turned the first word of each phrase into a sound-alike French, Spanish or German number.
There is the repetition of the number three in the theme, but they’re different languages and they’re funny so, on balance, I was willing to give it a pass. Finally, I noticed a few “escaped” foreign numbers in Mr. Wechsler’s grid, but he explains those below.
• 1A: I love this quote about James JOYCE (“I guess the man’s a genius, but what a dirty mind he has, hasn’t he?”). His wife, Nora JOYCE’s opinion about her husband continues in this interview from “James Joyce: Interviews and Recollections,” by E. H. Mikhail.
• 10A: I watched “Batman” religiously as a child, but OLGA, the “Queen of the Cossacks,” was a new one on me. She was portrayed in the 1960s television series by Anne Baxter.
• 62A: Trick question! “Who has won more Olympic medals than Michael Phelps?” is a great way to clue NO ONE.
• 2D: Hands up if you confidently dropped SONG into this slot. I quickly figured out that it was wrong, because I was pretty sure that the answer to 20A was ESS (“It’s twisted”). The answer is the ODES of Solomon.
• 8D: In the clue “Sole end?” we’re looking for what’s at the end of the sole of the foot, and, at least on mine, the answer is TOE.
• 13D: D.A.D.T. stands for “Don’t ASK, Don’t Tell,” the policy on military service by LGBTQ people instituted in 1994 and lasting until 2011.
• 45D: Beer STEINS are “Porter supporters?”, Porters being a type of dark beer.
I’m anticipating some commentary on the inclusion of the foreign language numbers DIECI (at 6-Down) and EIN (at 36-Across) in the grid. There seems to exist a certain notion of grid purity, suggesting that words relating to the theme (or even letter combinations) should be purged entirely from the fill. Otherwise, a degree of “inelegance” intrudes. I can understand that to some extent, but I don’t see it as compelling in all cases. In fact, I mentioned to Will that I could probably get rid of DIECI if necessary. But this was apparently not a problem, and I’m happy to be on the same side with Will on this. As for “EIN Heldenleben,” the translation is “A Hero’s Life”, so one can argue that this EIN is not a number, but an indefinite article.
And finally, I was delighted that my clue for 1-Across was accepted! I hope solvers find the puzzle enjoyable.
