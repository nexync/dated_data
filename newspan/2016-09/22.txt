On Saturday afternoon, seated in the front row of Christian Siriano’s sartorial sojourn to Capri were Kelly Osbourne, Coco Rocha, Christina Hendricks, Pamela Anderson, Neve Campbell and Jaimie Alexander.
They watched as an array of models, including a handful who are referred to in the industry as curvy or plus-size, made their way around the runway, wearing a collection that included shoes on sale at Payless and several looks that were made available on Amazon.com immediately after the show.
Their presence was a reminder of the effects star power can have on a designer who isn’t necessarily celebrated by fashion critics. “If the industry isn’t always around to support, there are really famous women who are,” Mr. Siriano said backstage after the show.
Mr. Siriano made fashion news twice this summer: first, when he dressed the actress Leslie Jones after she complained on Twitter that no designer wanted to help her with an outfit for the premiere of “Ghostbusters”; and, second, when Michelle Obama wore one of his dresses to the Democratic National Convention, at which she gave a widely praised speech.
“It was amazing,” Mr. Siriano said of the first lady’s decision. “Sometimes you need a person like that to give you a little boost.” His feelings on the acclaim that came after the situation with Ms. Jones were more reserved. “It was hard to be celebrated for just making a dress for somebody in that way,” said Mr. Siriano, who has worked with a range of celebrities, including Amber Rose, Lady Gaga and Laverne Cox.
What he hasn’t done is radically change the look he offers.
