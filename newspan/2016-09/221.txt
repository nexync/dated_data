On a recent Saturday afternoon, Lauren Lovette surveyed her dancers before sliding into a split — one of her go-to positions when she’s contemplating a step — and rose suddenly to move through a dynamic passage in her new ballet. She calls this part “soft serve.” In it, dancers line up along a diagonal and pirouette away as their arms swirl above their heads like curlicues topping a dip of Dairy Queen. She made some tweaks; her dancers peeled away from the line with more refinement but no less verve.
This fall, Ms. Lovette, 24, is working from that place of conviction. Ms. Lovette, one of two women who will unveil new works at City Ballet’s fall gala on Sept. 20 — the other is the choreographer Annabelle Lopez Ochoa — is under some pressure.
Last year, City Ballet commissioned works by four men, which had people wondering: Where are the women? Female choreographers remain rare in classical ballet, and Ms. Lovette knows it; she doesn’t want to coast.
Ms. Lovette had been at it only a week but said that she already found that her nerves had calmed. She was sleeping through the night. “Solidly,” she said during a rehearsal break at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet.
Ms. Lovette discovered it on Spotify, but to her disappointment her musician friends either dismissed it or hadn’t heard of it. One day, she asked Ms. Walters if she could play a recording of it for her. Ms. Walters stopped her five minutes in. “She was like, ‘Lauren, I love this piece, and I want to play it really badly,’” Ms. Lovette said.
Ms. Lovette has also relished the opportunity to use another part of her brain. In her private life, she likes to make things: She cooks, she crochets, she knits, she sketches, and she makes collages. “I pull trash off the street and I turn it into stuff and hang it on my walls,” she said.
