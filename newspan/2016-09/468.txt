European Central Bank is expected to keep rates steady.
Investors will be watching closely as the European Central Bank announces the results of its latest monetary policy meeting on Thursday. Most economists expect the central bank to maintain its benchmark interest rate at zero, where it has been since March. It is charging a negative interest rate of minus 0.4 percent on money that commercial banks keep at the central bank, to encourage banks to lend that money rather than hold it.
