Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, has pneumonia, her doctor said in a statement on Sunday.
While pneumonia is a common lung infection that most healthy people overcome, the illness can be more serious for people age 65 or older, according to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Mrs. Clinton is 68. The illness also tends to be more serious for infants, young children and people with other health problems.
Hillary Clinton briefly appeared unsteady on Sunday during a ceremony marking the 15th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attack. Her physician later said Mrs. Clinton is being treated for pneumonia and dehydration.
The severity of symptoms depends on the type of pneumonia a person has, as well as the person’s age and overall health.
Bacterial pneumonia can drive the body’s temperature as high as 105 degrees Fahrenheit, resulting in sweating, rapid breathing and confusion or delirium. With viral pneumonia, symptoms are typically more similar to influenza: fever, dry cough, headache or muscle pain.
In the statement, Mrs. Clinton’s doctor did not identify the type of pneumonia the candidate has, but said she was prescribed antibiotics and advised to rest.
It can take as little as a week for a healthy young person to feel normal again, according to the lung association. But it can be weeks before a middle-age person fully regains strength. Older adults are also one group that is more likely to have complications in recovery.
