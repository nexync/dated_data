Sometimes, though, there’s blessed comfort in being with people who share your anxieties. Even if — or perhaps especially if — what’s on their minds is one of the last things they talk about directly.
Watching “What Did You Expect?” at the Public Theater, you’re always aware of what characters, caught in the middle of a presidential election that seems almost too surreal and too important for words, are thinking. And you can tell how those thoughts inform every joke, sigh and anecdote that comes out of their mouths.
Embodied by a six-member cast that interacts with the chafing ease of real blood relatives, the title clan of Richard Nelson’s “The Gabriels: Election Year in the Life of One Family” has returned to offer us a mirror of our frightened, fallible selves at this very fraught moment in American history. Directed by its author, “What Did You Expect?” is the second work in the second cycle of plays by Mr. Nelson that have quietly emerged as a sui generis triumph of civic theater.
Like Mr. Nelson’s “The Apple Family Plays,” a tetralogy staged at the Public from 2010 to 2013, “The Gabriels” is set on the night the production opened (Friday, Sept. 16) in the small but increasingly fashionable riverside town of Rhinebeck, N.Y. The Gabriels share many traits with the Apples, including an interest in the arts and a tendency to channel tension through the preparation of food.
But though two cast members here also appeared as Apples — the marvelous Maryann Plunkett and Jay O. Sanders — the Gabriels are very much their own people. For one thing, they aren’t as well-off financially as the Apples. And there’s no use pretending that such economic differences don’t define their dealings with the world and one another.
Sure, they have a cozy village home that has been in the family for years, where Mary Gabriel (Ms. Plunkett), a retired doctor, resides after the death of her husband, Thomas, a playwright. But recently she’s had to take in a boarder, Karin Gabriel (Meg Gibson), an actress who was Thomas’s first wife.
Is also seems more than likely that this old house, which turns out to be mortgaged to the hilt, is going to become increasingly crowded in the near future. Patricia (Roberta Maxwell), Thomas’s mother, will probably have to leave the retirement home where she’s been living. And George (Mr. Sanders), Thomas’s brother, and his wife, Hannah (Lynn Hawley) may well have to sell their own place in the village and move back here.
These prospective changes are one of the reasons for this suppertime gathering of the Gabriels, who also include Joyce (Amy Warren), a costume designer who lives in Brooklyn. The extent of the family’s financial distress is revealed only by degrees. The Gabriels don’t know a lot about money, and they have never before had to think about it quite so much or with such apprehension.
“What Did You Expect?” wears its topicality with modest stealth. Its subjects are those that daily fill Op-Ed pages and pundit TV in a Babel of aggrieved and defensive voices: The acridness of the presidential race, an American populace that’s no longer sure of its identity and the yawning gap between the very rich and everybody else.
It is a testament to Mr. Nelson’s well-honed craft, and that of his cast, that these topics are seldom addressed directly yet are embedded in the play’s every fragment. His family cycles inhabit the here and now with an unobtrusive thoroughness I’ve never encountered elsewhere in the theater.
And make no mistake: “What Did You Expect?,” like its predecessors, is very much a work of theater. It trades gently and profitably in the present-tense intimacy between performers and audience in a small space and finds in the art of playacting a map of how we live our lives.
Designed by Susan Hilferty and Jason Ardizzone-West, with lighting by Jennifer Tipton and sound by Scott Lehrer and Will Pickens, the kitchen set is first seen as an anonymous space. Then the cast members arrive, bearing plates of food and boxes of papers and photographs.
In a twinkling, the kitchen assumes a richly detailed personality, the kind a room acquires over many years. And yet it has all materialized so fast. Which suggests it could disappear just as quickly.
That sense of transience is enhanced as the characters go through the letters, journals and books left by Thomas, reminders of both the late playwright and of people dead long before him. Thomas is still very present to Mary, in particular, and she is still periodically seized by the harsh awareness that he is no longer physically there.
Mary, the former doctor, is a stoic by nature and by training. But Ms. Plunkett’s marvelously open face lets us read every nuance of her character’s pain and longing. She is the play’s emotional hearth. Yet every performance here glows with a compelling, specifically embodied mixture of trepidation and hope, as the characters bicker and cosset, obliquely assigning blame and offering support.
At the beginning of “What Did You Expect?,” Karin is reading aloud from a French play translated by Thomas. It describes a set in which two men, standing outside, look through a window at a family going about their nightly rituals. Tragedy awaits this family; unbeknownst to them, the daughter of the house has just drowned.
There is a special sanctity in the last, quotidian moments before this horror is revealed. Mr. Nelson’s play isn’t nearly as stark or melodramatic as this one appears to be. Yet it’s hard not to identify with the unnamed observers, watching people much like ourselves, provisionally cocooned in a warm, well-lighted nest within a thick and far-reaching darkness.
