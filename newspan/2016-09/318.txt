BERKELEY, Calif. — A vain politician runs for the presidency, short on specifics but long on bluster, inveighing against a religious minority and promising to make America prosperous again.
The play, which began previews on Friday, is among scores of efforts by theaters across the United States to provoke discussion and reflection about this year’s unusual election, and the unease that it has exposed. Some, like Berkeley Rep, explicitly aim to prompt discussion about Donald J. Trump, whose candidacy has alarmed many in the left-leaning theater world; others have opted to stage works in which characters grapple with issues debated during the campaign, like immigration or economic inequality.
On a recent afternoon, the cast and crew of “It Can’t Happen Here” gathered at Berkeley Rep’s administrative campus in a high-ceilinged warehouse once occupied by the North Face, to run through the play one last time before moving into a downtown Berkeley theater.
The designers had embraced the stars-and-stripes feel of a campaign: The set featured flags and drums and images of national parks, and the sound design included a Sousa march. Fourteen actors played nearly 50 roles, and practiced egging on the audience to cheer and jeer with the onstage pageantry.
The theater printed red-white-and-blue lapel stickers bearing the play’s name for patrons, meant to echo the ubiquitous “I Voted” stickers; leaders considered, but decided against, holding a series of related discussion programs, thinking that the culture is already saturated with election talk. The play is scheduled to close Nov. 6, two days before the election.
Around the country, theaters are acknowledging the election in various ways. On Broadway, “Kinky Boots” has created a video and website to promote voter registration, while “Hamilton” cast members are planning to register voters outside their theater on Wednesday and Saturday; Off Broadway, “Avenue Q” has added Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump puppets to its company. Some theaters are staging Mike Daisey’s comedic monologue “The Trump Card,” while many others have brought back plays about political figures, from Frank Rizzo in Philadelphia to Lyndon Baines Johnson in Cleveland and Costa Mesa, Calif. In Washington, five prominent theaters are holding a series of free Monday night readings of politically themed plays, including “Ivanka: A Medea for Right Now,” a fictional work about Mr. Trump’s daughter by the playwright Joshua Harmon.
Berkeley Rep hit upon “It Can’t Happen Here” about eight months ago, when an unexpected hole opened in its fall season. Lisa Peterson, who had signed on to direct a show for Berkeley Rep, Googled the phrase “it can’t happen here” and stumbled across the Sinclair Lewis novel, which she was not familiar with; Mr. Taccone had read the book in high school and thought it would work.
The novel is about a Vermont newspaper editor, Doremus Jessup, who opposes a demagogic presidential candidate, Berzelius Windrip; it is a satirical and melodramatic cautionary tale, in which Mr. Windrip wins the election, imposes martial law and seizes control of newspapers; his regime arrests and even kills his critics.
Lewis, who had already won the Nobel Prize for literature, wrote the novel against an ominous backdrop: Hitler and Mussolini were in power in Germany and Italy, and Huey Long, a senator and former governor who wielded unusual power in Louisiana, was preparing to run for the American presidency.
There are some striking similarities between the campaign pitches by the fictional Mr. Windrip and the real Mr. Trump — both men were even nominated for the presidency in Cleveland. But there are significant differences: Windrip, among other things, is a Democrat (in the novel, the Republican nominee winds up fleeing to Canada to plot a rebellion) and prone to warnings against Jews; Mr. Trump, of course, is a Republican who has focused his concern on Muslims.
The novel was first adapted into a play and presented around the country in the late 1930s by the Federal Theater Project — Lewis himself appeared in one production, in Cohasset, Mass., as the journalist Jessup. But Berkeley Rep deemed that adaptation unrevivable (“it’s ghastly,” said Susan Medak, its managing director), so Mr. Taccone and Mr. Cohen, with the blessing of the Lewis estate, set about writing a new one in unusually short time.
Noting that the 1930s adaptation by Lewis and J. C. Moffitt was presented by multiple theaters around the country, Berkeley Rep this month invited theaters, universities and libraries across the country to hold readings of the play; 30 organizations signed up in the first week.
