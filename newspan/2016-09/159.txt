Re-enacting a Childhood Trauma on Video. For Art.
When she was 15, Antonia Wright was walking across the frozen surface of a reservoir near Boston with a friend when the ice gave way, and they both plunged into the freezing water.
They weren’t supposed to be there, of course — the reservoir was off limits. So help was not close by. She struggled to crawl out, but kept losing her grip on the ice. In that moment, Ms. Wright, now a successful artist, felt sheer panic.
Finally, after five or 10 minutes — time seemed to slow down in the moment, she recalled in a recent interview — the pair were able to break through enough ice to open a path to reach the shore.
She spent a week battling the effects of hypothermia.
The artist, 36, has revisited that traumatic event as part of a multimedia exhibition that just opened at the nonprofit Locust Projects gallery in Miami. The show, “Under the water was sand, then rocks, miles of rocks, then fire,” which runs through Oct. 8, centers on a filmed re-enactment of the fall, which Ms. Wright recreated in January 2015.
The installation also incorporates lights on timers and a mazelike corridor filled with night-blooming jasmine plants. In the darkened space, the jasmine releases its nocturnal fragrance as visitors wind their way toward a double-sided video screen.
“Why not use the darkness that these videos require to bring out another one of our senses?” she said.
She once covered herself with 15,000 live bees for a filmed performance. In 2014, at Art Basel Miami Beach, she showed “Suddenly We Jumped,” a video in which she threw herself, nude, through a pane of breakaway glass.
She filmed the ice performance on Lake Champlain, with a team of divers on hand, but this time the event was far less harrowing.
“During the video shoot, when I was submerged in the lake, it was a few of the most peaceful and beautiful seconds of my life,” she wrote in an email.
