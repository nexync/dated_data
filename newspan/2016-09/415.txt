Dreaming of buying a home in the city? Using data from the National Association of Realtors, HSH.com, which compiles mortgage and consumer loan information, crunched some numbers that reveal what it would take.
Using the association’s data for the second quarter for median home prices and HSH.com’s average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages for the same time period, the site calculated what you would need to earn annually to afford a home in 27 metropolitan areas around the country.

The data showed that the national median sales price for homes is $240,700. And to be able to afford that, the average homeowner would have to earn $52,699.17 a year. But real estate, of course, is all about location, and the markets for homes are local.
