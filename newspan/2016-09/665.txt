For years, Hillary Clinton has been asked if she is held to a double standard as a woman in politics. And for years, she has mostly refused to take the bait.
But on Thursday, the day after a top Republican accused her of insufficient smiling at a televised national security forum, Mrs. Clinton suggested that it was, at least, a question worth considering.
Supporters of Mrs. Clinton instantly accused Mr. Priebus of sexism, and her campaign team moved quickly to amplify the remarks.
“I had a very short window of time in that event last night to convey the seriousness with which I would approach the issues that concern our country,” she said, appearing to allude to what critics described as a rushed format.
She noted that Mr. Trump had devoted much of his speaking time to praising President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.
