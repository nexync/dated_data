Hannity volunteered to me that he was relying solely on his memory: “I’ve had people go through the archives,” he said, “and unfortunately we’ve changed syndicators and stations and it’s hard to get ahold of.” I later asked a Fox News spokeswoman to confirm both the effort to locate such an audiotape and the implication that no digitized versions exist. She thanked me for my inquiry but would not provide additional information.
I recently reached out to Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, for more details about this meeting. She didn’t provide any, but a high-ranking former Bush White House senior official told me categorically that no such meeting ever happened, and that no one from the administration was deputized to talk to Trump.
A month after Trump’s equivocal comments to Cavuto, Secretary of State Colin Powell went before the United Nations Security Council to make the case for war. The Security Councilwas unpersuaded, and the American-led coalition invaded Iraq anyway. If Trump issued any protest about Bush’s decision in the days or months that followed, neither he nor anyone else has yet pointed to them.
