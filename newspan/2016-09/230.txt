“Seed: The Untold Story” is one of those documentaries that get you riled up about a situation but leave you feeling that nothing significant can be done about it.
The film, by Jon Betz and Taggart Siegel, takes a wide-ranging look at the issues of diminishing diversity in the world’s seed supply and ownership of those seeds. (The title is disingenuous; other documentaries have also examined these questions.) The rise of big agriculture, we’re told, has led to an alarming reduction in the varieties of food being grown and has imprisoned farmers in debt as they have become beholden to the corporations that sell seeds and pesticides. Along with this sea change in the way our food is produced has come the rise of genetically modified crops, something that to many people is yet another case of humans’ manipulating nature with no idea of potential long-term consequences.
These issues are for the most part voiced by small farmers, counterculture types and others who are earnest but don’t bring much gravitas or scientific evidence to the case. The film would be better if it had fewer shots of quixotic explorers sampling jungle plants while airy music plays and more hard information. When your opposition consists of giant corporations like Monsanto (the companies are not heard from in the film, by the way), you’d better bring more to the fight than a flute and some folk tales.
