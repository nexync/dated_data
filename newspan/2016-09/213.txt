Recently, I was expecting a delivery to my fourth-floor walk-up apartment. The delivery service called to say that my delivery was running late. An hour later, the deliveryman arrived, huffing and puffing. He bemoaned the stairs, said he couldn’t believe that I walked them every day and shook his head profusely, saying he didn’t understand how anyone could live with only stairs. After he dropped off my items, he apologized for being late. He said the reason was that he had gotten stuck in an elevator.
