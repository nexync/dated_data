Donald J. Trump encouraged Russia at a news conference to find Hillary Clinton’s missing correspondence.
I have a real problem when Hillary Clinton, who gives open access to a phony server, is allowed to get these briefings. How does Hillary Clinton get a national security briefing when she’s been probably hacked, when so much of her information — the director of the F.B.I. said it was essentially negligent. But it would be interesting to see. I will tell you this: Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. I have nothing to do with Russia. I said that — I said that Putin has much better leadership qualities than Obama. But who doesn’t know that? Because it’s under audit. I’ll release them [tax returns] when the audit’s completed. Nobody would release what it’s under — I’ve had audits for 15 or 16 years. Every year I have a routine audit. Under audit — when the audit is complete I’ll release them. But zero — I mean, I will tell you right now, zero — I’ve nothing to do with Russia.
