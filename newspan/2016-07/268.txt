Cleveland and Philadelphia, with areas of gleaming renewal and others of crushing poverty, illustrate the plight of America’s cities, little discussed in the campaign.
CLEVELAND — It was a sparkling scene of urban renaissance: Children scampered through the fountain in Public Square, spruced up at a cost of $50 million just in time for the Republican convention here. Electricians installed security cameras on the redesigned plaza as carpenters put the finishing touches on a new cafe.
Twenty minutes south, in a neighborhood called Slavic Village, Robert Smith and David Rajecki, both 58-year-old disabled factory workers, surveyed a vastly different scene. Historically a bustling center of Czech and Polish immigrant life, Slavic Village was sliding into decay even before it was devastated by the foreclosure crisis.
As Republicans gather in Cleveland to nominate Donald J. Trump for president, and Democrats in Philadelphia to nominate Hillary Clinton, the nation is in the thick of searing debates over terrorism, race and policing, gun violence and immigration. But the host cities, both in Rust Belt swing states, spotlight something Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton rarely discuss: the plight of urban America.
Amid a widening gap between rich and poor, nothing screams income inequality louder than cities, including Cleveland and Philadelphia, case studies in renewal and gentrification, but also in crushing decline. And perhaps no Americans capture as well as those who live in and advocate for these cities the feeling that the nation’s present cannot match its past.
Here in Cleveland, Kurt Karakul, president of Third Federal Foundation, a nonprofit that works to improve Slavic Village, is furious at the attention paid to “bricks and mortar” investment downtown, while the neighborhood he is trying to help is so poor, he said, that every public school student qualifies for free or reduced-price lunch.
Once symbols of American industrial might and prosperity, Cleveland and Philadelphia are among the poorest cities in the nation. In 2014, Philadelphia had the highest poverty rate (26 percent) among cities with more than a million people, while Cleveland has the third-highest poverty rate (39.2 percent) among cities with more than 100,000 residents, according to census data analyzed by the Brookings Institution.
Cleveland also has exceedingly high rates of “concentrated poverty” — poor people living in poor neighborhoods. Both cities have very segregated African-American populations, according to William H. Frey, a Brookings demographer. In both, there are tensions between blacks and police; the Cleveland Police Department operates under a federal consent decree.
Like other World War II-era manufacturing hubs — Pittsburgh, Detroit, Milwaukee, Baltimore and even Boston and New York — Philadelphia and Cleveland hollowed out during the latter half of the 20th century, losing jobs and people.
Today, both cities rely on “eds and meds” — educational and medical institutions — as engines for jobs and growth. But while Boston and New York had started to rebound in the 1990s, Philadelphia and especially Cleveland have had slower rebirths.
In 1950, Philadelphia was the nation’s third-largest city, with a population of nearly 2.1 million, and Cleveland was seventh, at about 915,000. By 2010, Philadelphia was down to about 1.5 million and Cleveland to fewer than 400,000.
Since then, Cleveland’s population has dropped more, while Philadelphia’s has ticked up — a sign of what Rolf Pendall, a scholar at the Urban Institute in Washington, called “a comeback story.” But some see the comeback as overrated.
Mantua, a proud but downtrodden West Philadelphia neighborhood whose rich African-American history is chronicled in colorful murals, is where those two classes may one day meet.
Mantua is part of a “Promise Zone,” an Obama administration initiative to help poor communities. Nearly two-thirds of Mantua households have incomes below $25,000; the typical home sells for between $10,000 and $15,000, Mr. Goldstein said. But Mantua also has a wealthy neighbor: Drexel University.
Jimmy Allen, a retired teacher and 1960s street gang leader who functions as Mantua’s de facto mayor, knows its ills: boarded-up houses, drug addiction, struggling schools. And he knows its strengths: leaders with deep community roots. But what Mr. Allen, 68, frets most over are its vacant lots.
Mantua is overrun with large grassy tracts where homes once stood; many have been purchased by developers and speculators. Separately, John A. Fry, the Drexel president, has just unveiled an ambitious plan: a $3.5 billion, 14-acre development of parks, businesses and high-rises to be built over four decades, connecting the campus to 30th Street Station, the nearby railroad hub.
Mr. Allen is unconvinced. He worries that speculators will move in, destroying the neighborhood’s character.
The housing bust continues for many in Cleveland, especially in predominantly black neighborhoods. The city is tearing down hundreds of homes to deal with the blight that has resulted.
CLEVELAND AND THE SURROUNDING SUBURBS WERE HIT HARD BY THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND THIS IS THE LATEST DEVELOPMENT IN THE RECOVERY. A RECYCLING CENTER FOR THE REMAINS OF BLIGHTED HOMES EMPTIED, AND ABANDONED BY FORECLOSURE OR HOMEOWNERS SIMPLY WALKING AWAY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO MAINTAIN THEM. IN SOME AREAS OF CLEVELAND A QUARTER OF THE HOMES ARE NOW VACANT. KIM FIELDS: There were more families, more homeowners now its very distressed its not very clean and I don’t want to live like with bars on my window I don’t, and I want people to come over and not say oh my god look at the house next to you, that’s not what I want them to see, that’s not what I want to see when I walk out of my house. VO: KIM FIELDS LIVES IN THE WOODLAND HILLS NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE CITY’S PREDOMINANTLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN EAST SIDE. SHE BOUGHT HER FIRST HOME HERE IN 2001, JUST A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM THE HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS BORN. VO: FOR MOST OF THE COUNTRY THE RECESSION AND THE HOUSING CRISIS ENDED 7 YEARS AGO, BUT HOME PRICES HERE ARE STILL FALLING. HOMES ARE WORTH ON AVERAGE 70 TO 80% LESS THAN THEY WERE 15 YEARS AGO. KIM FIELDS: This house has been vacant since 2014 I believe.//And there’s another property there. So one two three four.. THERE ARE 6000 EMPTY HOMES ON THE EAST SIDE OF CLEVELAND. ERIC LOFTON LIVES DOWN THE BLOCK FROM FIELDS, NEXT TO ANOTHER RECENTLY EMPTIED HOUSE. FIELDS: this was a decent looking house too cause I saw the guy taking care of it. Eric: All new kitchen Kim: Are you serious, are you serious. Eric: The Bank still owns this property. They paid them to move out. And when they came over I told the guy someone is going to go in there as soon as they see them moving. They should have let the family just stay in, and then at least it would have been occupied wouldn’t have broken in. I am talking about not even an hour after they left someone was over here wiping the house out. Cleaning it out. //Hot water tank, water furnaces, everything gone. Stainless steel sinks were here. All of it gone. Its really bad, the whole area we don’t get a break. (SOME NAT HERE ABOUT HER CLEANING UP THE NEIGHBORHOOD) IT was much more stuff back here but when we did our community cleanup in april Community members helped to pick up 75% of the stuff, there was so much stuff in here // that’s what they do they just come and pull their trucks up here and dump. (trim) *****[00:12:50] Coming home every day and just riding down my street and seeing some of the houses that were so beautiful. And look at them just look at them now. RICHARD: (MVI_0076 8:54) I would like to think that the banks have a moral responsibility but it doesn’t seem they work on moral responsibility// RICHARD GOUDREAU IS WITH HARVARD COMMUNITY SERVICES CENTER, A LOCAL NONPROFIT. (NAT) THE CITY HAS BECOME SO OVERWHELMED BY THE VACANT AND BLIGHTED HOMES ITS NOW FALLEN ON GROUPS LIKE GOUDREAU’S AND CITIZENS TO HELP ENFORCE THE LAW. (NAT) EACH WEEK HE JOINS ACTIVIST ANITA GARDNER ON A TOUR OF EMPTY AND BLIGHTED HOUSES.  (NATS) ANITA: [00:12:16] Most black communities are targets. Easy targets because we don’t get together we don’t holler loud enough we don’t scream loud enough. And then when we do we’re violent. Or it was our fault. We don’t know what we’re talking about. If someone told you you could have the american dream, we’re like everyone else we want a house. RICHARD: (MVI_0076 8:54) These were all middle income, middle class worked at the steel plant, ford chevy chrysler, and the parts plants, those jobs left, the predatory lending came in, it was just a perfect storm of everything right in this area, and this is what you have left//people are just walking away from the properties. Just wholesale walking away. (CRASH) CHERYL: we’re still working to get families back into homeownership. But every house can’t be saved. SHERYL STEPHENS IS IN CHARGE OF DEMOLITIONS FOR THE COUNTY’S LAND BANK. IT’S A NON PROFIT ENTITY TASKED WITH ACQUIRING BLIGHTED PROPERTIES AND HOPEFULLY FINDING A PRODUCTIVE USE FOR THEM. OFTEN THAT MEANS TEARING THE STRUCTURES DOWN FIRST. (CRASH) CHERYL STEPHENS: We went from one hundred and fifty demos in the first year to last year we did it approximately eight hundred fifty. And this year we’re on track to do nine hundred fifty two thousand more.//When we started there were approximately twenty nine thousand thirty thousand or structures that were functionally obsolete vacant and blighted and condemned that we needed to demolish across the county //the Cuyahoga land bank and its partners have eliminated over 6000 properties in this process. CHERYL STEPHENS: So there are multiple reasons why we tear houses down. First of all the population of Greater Cleveland has been reduced over the last 20 years. // Now// the official count is below 400000 people. The number of structures we have in the city are in excess of the population numbers. ****VO: IT CAN COST $40 TO $90,000 TO REHAB A HOME AND MAKE IT LIVABLE FOR A FAMILY, SOMETIMES AS MUCH AS THE PRICE OF BUILDING A NEW ONE SOMEWHERE ELSE. BUT ONLY ABOUT $10000 TO DEMOLISH IT. EACH BLIGHTED STRUCTURE REMOVED ALSO HELPS BRING UP THE PROPERTY VALUES OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. [00:00:00] In Ohio we have a very modest housing prices. And with low housing values it’s not the same as in New York City or Chicago or San Francisco. Where a structure and the plot of land it’s own are worth so much more. I mean the vacant partitions are selling for and we’re transferring them to non-profits for like $100 or if you’re an adjacent property owner for a hundred dollars countywide AT THAT RECYCLING PLANT THEY’RE RECEIVING THE REMAINS OF UP TO TEN HOMES A DAY, DESTINED TO BE TURNED INTO GARDEN MULCH OR BURNED FOR FUEL. SCOTT HINKLE IS THE OPERATIONS MANAGER. (SCOTT EXPLAINING THE PROCESS) We demo houses...goes across the belt. We have anywhere between 7 and 9 guys separating the concrete and wood. SCOTT: When you’re pushing it down a hill and you see a toy or something that wasn’t cleaned out, well you think there was someone living in it at one point. And it it makes you think// this was once in a neighborhood where someone lived, now what is going to happen to the neighborhood. And then you think its actually coming together its better the house is going down, the crime is going down, now the homeless people are not going go to be you know squatting there, the drug addicts. We need this, we needed this a long time ago. FOR KIM AND HER NEIGHBORS EACH HOUSE TORN DOWN IS BITTER SWEET. A DANGER AND EYE SORE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD GONE, BUT HOMES THAT ONCE HELD FAMILIES ARE GONE TOO. THE WEALTH GAP BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE HOUSEHOLDS REVERSED ITS TREND AND GREW IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE RECESSION. THE EFFECTS OF THAT COULD LAST FOR GENERATIONS... [00:09:30] Every day. I find a new house. Last summer. There was people living in the house of a kids playing on the lawn. And now I go by there in the doors open and use trash on along there is no curtains. There’s broken windows there because what happened. No it’s still happening. And it’s not going to stop. For a while. And I don’t know what’s going to make it stop.
That tension over gentrification is the story of many old industrial cities; here in Cleveland it is playing out in Ohio City, where lively restaurants and boutiques are attracting hipsters and millennials. Syrian, Lebanese and Egyptian vendors sell fruit and vegetables at the popular West Side Market there. “I take master’s degree in my country — now I sell fruit,” said Chrestina Sedrak, a former psychology teacher who fled Cairo during the 2011 uprising.
While Ms. Sedrak sees opportunity, Narrin Noud-Carberg, 52, who survived the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and arrived here in 1981, is less upbeat. The restaurants and shops are bringing in customers, but sales at her spice shop are flat; customers look but do not buy.
Eli Fletcher, 56, a musician who strolls the market in a caped crusader costume and calls himself “Guitar Man” (“I save Cleveland one song at a time”), can no longer afford to live in Ohio City, where he grew up, the son of a former coal miner who left West Virginia for Cleveland seeking factory work.
“This whole gentrification thing forgets that this is a nitty-gritty city, and not some posh resort,” Mr. Fletcher said.
As both cities look toward their moment in the spotlight, John Grabowski, a historian at Case Western Reserve University here, cautions against too much nostalgia; cities, after all, are living things. Mr. Grabowski, editor of an encyclopedia of Cleveland history, grew up in Slavic Village. His boyhood home fell into disrepair after his family left, and was eventually burned. Today it is an empty lot.
Still, there are bright spots. The local bank Third Federal Savings and Loan — whose owners, descendants of Polish immigrants, started the foundation Mr. Karakul runs — is helping to build and finance new homes that sell for as much as $130,000.
On Fleet Avenue, a popcorn maker who sells his treats at the West Side Market is planning a new manufacturing plant. And on Broadway Avenue, in a long-shuttered butcher shop, a maker of cured meat and sausage is moving in.
Mr. Brancatelli, who sees the foreclosure crisis and its fallout as the root of “social unrest,” said the national conversation around “old industrial cities” like Cleveland had changed — for the worse. Eight years ago, when Barack Obama ran against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, they debated in Cleveland and their advisers participated in a forum on housing at City Hall.
