Ms. Maul said party leaders declined to be interviewed unless they had the opportunity to authorize their comments before publication, which The New York Times does not do.
Currently, some polls show that the party is likely to win two or three seats in the next elections, but others show it gaining only one seat at most.
“There have been other populist, pro-migrant parties that have so far not been successful,” said Lars Rensmann, a professor of European Politics and Society at the University of Groningen, who studies European political parties, including right-wing extremist and populist parties.
Many on the left worry that any gains for Denk will come at the expense of the more mainstream Labor Party.
Ahmed Marcouch, a Dutch member of Parliament in the Labor Party who was born in Morocco and has lived in the Netherlands since 1979, fears that Denk will only exacerbate divisions in Dutch society along ethnic lines.
“Our view in the Labor Party is that we want to create a society with all the people together, without it being important where you’re from,” he said.
But there are those who feel that Labor has done little to promote the interests of minority groups.
“They have struck a chord with people who feel there’s no voice in Parliament that speaks on their behalf on the crucial issues of Islamophobia and racism,” said Sandew Hira, director of the International Institute for Scientific Research, which is based in The Hague and conducts research on identity formation and colonialism.
Denk has resonated with people like Jerry Afriyie, a poet who was born in Ghana and grew up in the Netherlands. He is the founder of Nederland Wordt Beter, or The Netherlands Will Be Better, a grass-roots activist group that espouses some of the politics of the Black Lives Matter movement. It has also staged demonstrations against Black Pete.
