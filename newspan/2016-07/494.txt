San Francisco — Diane Wilsey, head of the board of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and its chief executive, is stepping down from her post. She is ceding some of her responsibilities to Max Hollein, the new director of the Fine Arts group, which oversees the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park and the Legion of Honor near the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Ms. Wilsey, known as Dede, is expected to remain on the board.
An art collector and patron, Ms. Wilsey has been a powerful leader of the Fine Arts Museums since Herzog & de Meuron completed its building for the de Young in Golden Gate Park in 2005, with funds that she primarily raised. She was instrumental in choosing Mr. Hollein as the institution’s new director earlier this year after Colin Bailey, her previous choice, stayed only two years.
A museum spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
