Senator Bernie Sanders offered a full-throated endorsement of Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, urging his supporters to get behind the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. But many of his most loyal followers are not feeling it just yet.
Disappointment in Mr. Sanders cascaded across the internet as he embraced his former rival, describing her as a comrade in the fight to overhaul a rigged campaign finance system and lift the poor out of poverty. The sadness was most evident on the Facebook page where the Vermont senator explained his decision in a message titled “Forever forward” that drew responses infused with a skeptical refrain: Never Hillary.
“You broke my heart and betrayed the left Senator Sanders,” wrote Cesar Agusto Diaz, a Sanders supporter from New York.
Daniel Whitfield, of Discovery Bay, Calif., insisted that the political revolution Mr. Sanders had championed did not have to end just because the senator had given up. However, he said that voting for Mrs. Clinton was not an option.
Some backers of Mr. Sanders suggested that they would give Mrs. Clinton a chance in order to stop Donald J. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. Others rejected the idea of having to choose between “the lesser of two evils” and suggested that they would give a third party a chance.
Some of the lesser-known candidates running for president sought to capitalize on the moment.
Jill Stein, the Green Party’s presidential nominee, sent out a barrage of Twitter posts as Mr. Sanders made his endorsement arguing that Mrs. Clinton’s policies were antithetical to a liberal progressive agenda.
And Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party’s nominee, made his own pitch to supporters of Mr. Sanders who are not sold on Mrs. Clinton.
For those who believed that Mr. Sanders still had a chance to snatch the nomination at the convention in Philadelphia, it was too soon after his endorsement to consider alternatives. It would take time for the mix of anger and disbelief to subside.
