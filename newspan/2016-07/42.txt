The police in San Diego are asking the public for help in finding a man they believe killed two homeless men and critically injured two others in a string of attacks that started on Sunday.
David Nisleit, a captain in the San Diego Police Department’s Homicide Division, said that in all the cases, the victims had been found with significant trauma to their upper bodies.
The first victim was discovered on Sunday morning after a fire was reported in the Bay Park area of San Diego. Arriving on the scene, firefighters and police officers discovered the body of Angelo Denardo, 53, whose body had been set aflame after being attacked.
Mr. Nisleit said that a medical examiner found that Mr. Denardo died before his body was set on fire.
A second man, also homeless, was found bleeding near the Midway District on Monday morning. Mr. Nisleit said that he had also experienced “extremely significant trauma” to his upper torso and was in critical condition.
The man’s name has not yet been released because his next of kin had not been notified as of Tuesday evening. He is 61 years old.
The body of a third man, whose name and age have not been identified, was found about an hour later in the Ocean Beach area of the city. He was also homeless and had been attacked in a manner similar to the other two victims.
There was no sign that the attacker had attempted to set fire to either of the two victims found Monday.
But on Wednesday, a fourth homeless man was found on fire between apartments in the city’s downtown.
“This is going to be linked to the other attacks,” Mr. Nisleit told The San Diego Union-Tribune.
A witness was able to pull off a towel from the man that had been soaked in a flammable liquid, saving him from burns.
