Hot dogs. Dog days of summer. When describing how canine New Yorkers weather the hot weather, the cutesy clichés are easy. But keeping a pup cool during a heat wave is not.

At Malibu Dog Kitchen, a dog food specialty store in the West Village, Ashley Brooks, the operations manager, said: In the heat, pay special attention to dog feet. The hot sidewalk, she said, “scalds their little paws.” Her two Chihuahuas wear teeny shoes in this weather. “It’s ridiculous,” she said, before suggesting that pet owners make goat-milk Popsicles to cool down their dogs.
The schnauzer Buca, 9, who lives in the neighborhood, gets by on frozen watermelon. “We keep the watermelon people in business,” said Martin Schneider, 56, who works in the airline industry.
