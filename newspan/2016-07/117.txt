Mr. Wiesel became an eloquent witness for the six million Jews slaughtered in World War II, driving home the enormity of what happened through several dozen books.
On April 11, after eating nothing for six days, Mr. Wiesel was among those liberated by the United States Third Army. Years later, he identified himself in a famous photograph among the skeletal men lying supine in a Buchenwald barracks.
Only after the war did he learn that his two elder sisters had not perished.
