An avid painter with a background in science, Yaitanes began mixing acrylic paints in the dining room of her Los Angeles home, determined to find a palette that would look good against any complexion. “My feeling is that a lot of nudes are made by mixing brown pigments with white pigments, and making a tan,” she says of why most beige lipsticks fall flat. “There’s not enough reds, blues and yellows underneath it, which is what you would do if painting someone’s skin.” The secret to formulas that “look human,” she says, hinges on color proportions. After tinkering for 12 months, she hit upon her current range of eight fuss-free shades — reds, plums and rosy neutrals (no beigey nudes) — that are just “really easy” to wear, she says.
And applying the products will never involve special steps. Yaitanes’s only rules for putting on lipstick are as follows: exfoliate your lips first, then slick on two coats — either straight from the tube or dabbed on with your finger. “And no lip liner, ever,” she says.
