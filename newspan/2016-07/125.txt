Jennifer Aniston Is Not Pregnant. Why Do We Care?
She has a point: Ms. Aniston, 47, has long been used by supermarket tabloids, gossip websites and celebrity magazines as the reductive avatar of the complicated Hollywood It Girl.
First, she was cast as the The Girl Next Door, starring in the megahit sitcom “Friends” and marrying Brad Pitt.
Then she became the Scorned Wife after her divorce (and, later, Mr. Pitt’s marriage to Angelina Jolie) ushered in the feverish “Team Aniston” era, which spanned several years and created an “insane Bermuda Triangle,” as she told GQ in 2008.
And the title of that GQ article, “Lordy, Lordy, This Woman Is 40,” signaled a new era for Ms. Aniston.
Ms. Aniston’s marriage to the actor Justin Theroux — whom she wed in 2015 after years of speculative headlines about their relationship — has entered the territory of constant conjecture over whether or not she is pregnant.
The obsession over women and their pregnancies goes far beyond Ms. Aniston: It is ingrained in our culture to “police and survey” women’s bodies, especially pregnant ones, said Amanda Rossie, who researches Women’s and Gender Studies at The College of New Jersey.
Ms. Rossie said that the increased use of social media and blogging, as well as the rise of so-called Bump Watch areas of celebrity gossip websites have led to a frenzy where women are not only consuming celebrity baby news, they’re posting their own bump photos on social media.
Ms. Aniston has done traditional publicity, sometimes posing for magazine covers, but she has never willingly participated in the deeper frenzy of the gossip sites. While many celebrities have shared stories of their sex lives, fertility struggles and pregnancies with the world on social media — some have even made money off pregnancy announcements through sponsored content — she has steered clear.
