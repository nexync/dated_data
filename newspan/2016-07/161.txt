The Colombian reggaeton singer J Balvin is a worldwide star who’s still waiting for some English speakers — maybe even a lot of them — to recognize his stardom. He’s been around for a little while already; he’ll be around for a while to come. He’s got time. Now 31, Mr. Balvin has just released “Energía,” his second album, a romantic reggaeton record with clear movements toward a pop sound-world shaped by Drake, Justin Bieber and Pharrell Williams. (He appeared on the Latin remix of Justin Bieber’s hit “Sorry” and Mr. Williams produced — and sang in Spanish — on one of the tracks on “Energía.”) “Ginza,” the album’s first single, which came out last summer, spent longer at the top of Billboard’s Hot Latin Songs chart than any song from another single artist (i.e., without guest performers). Its video has been watched more than 580 million times on YouTube. He’s popular in France and Italy and Romania. This level of success is not that common for Spanish-language reggaeton — “Energía” is an all-Spanish-language album. Yet. Our guest, the Times music reporter Joe Coscarelli, talks about Mr. Balvin’s success and what it’s like to drop in on a commercial radio station — New York’s Hot 97 — with Mr. Balvin, who is a celebrity in the hallways but whose music isn’t part of the regular daytime playlist. Yet.
