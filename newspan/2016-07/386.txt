The Obama administration has continuously tried a policy of “deterrence” toward refugees fleeing the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala).
My son Moises escaped the violence in El Salvador by seeking asylum as a minor. He became so terrified of being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement that he decided it would be safer to go back to El Salvador on his own and give up his asylum case. Six months after returning to El Salvador, he was murdered by armed strangers while playing soccer. He was 19.
The United States has a heightened obligation to the Northern Triangle. American foreign policy toward the region has caused political and economic destabilization that has had unending and extreme consequences.
Does President Obama have the political will to stop this horror? Does this country have the courage to take responsibility for its actions?
