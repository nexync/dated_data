PARIS — On Saturday, the New York City Ballet will wrap up a 20-ballet, three-week season at Théâtre du Châtelet here, the company’s longest international tour to one city since 1976. City Ballet was presented by Les Etés de la Danse, an annual summer festival that brings dance companies — often American ones — to the French capital.
Houses have been full, critics have been fulsome, and audiences rapturously appreciative. Meanwhile, the dancers have been enjoying Parisian life, sightseeing on their days off, hanging out in cafes and occasionally proposing marriage. Here are some snapshots of City Ballet in Paris, and edited excerpts from conversations with the dancers.
Justin Peck, a soloist with City Ballet as well as its resident choreographer, came to Paris a month earlier than his colleagues to work with the Paris Opera Ballet. His “Entre Chien et Loup” for Paris Opera has been running at the same time as the City Ballet season.
“It’s my first experience working in Europe, and it has been so nice to be living here and not feel so much like a tourist,” Mr. Peck said over a coffee on Monday. “I stayed in the Marais, which was great because I could walk to work every day. Sometimes I did class with the Paris Opera Ballet, other times I’d warm up by myself and listen to my music to get into the right head space.
Dancing at Châtelet was a homecoming for Robert Fairchild, a City Ballet principal who starred in Christopher Wheeldon’s production of “An American in Paris,” which appeared at the Châtelet in 2014 before opening on Broadway in April 2015.
