Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York has filed a lawsuit against a Russian woman who accused him of an assault at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan this year, alleging that he is the subject of an extended and expanding attempt at extortion.
The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Friday, offers new details about the combative and disastrous relationship between Mr. Spitzer — who resigned in disgrace in 2008 after being linked to a high-end prostitution ring — and Svetlana Andreevna Zakharova, 26, who is also known as Lana Travis.
In February, the police investigated a claim and a 911 call made by Ms. Zakharova that Mr. Spitzer had choked her during a meeting at the Plaza Hotel, but she later recanted before returning to Russia and apologized to Mr. Spitzer via email. No charges were ever filed.
“Ms. Zakharova demanded that Mr. Spitzer provide her with money, stating that if he did not do so she would ‘ruin his life,’” the lawsuit alleges, saying she wanted “hundreds of thousands of dollars, trips to Paris and other valuable property.” Ms. Zakharova also wanted to rekindle the relationship, the suit charges, and sent hostile emails and other threats.
Mr. Spitzer’s representatives were not able to provide contact information for Ms. Zakharova, nor were efforts to find her in Russia successful.
Despite his fall from grace, Mr. Spitzer has continued to have a presence in New York City, and its tabloid chronicles, since stepping down. In 2014, he and his longtime wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, divorced, and he had a relationship with Lis Smith, who ran Bill de Blasio’s communications during his mayoral campaign.
Mr. Spitzer’s lawyers provided emails to The New York Times — which they said Ms. Zakharova had sent — that suggested a serious grievance with the former governor.
Those emails were in sharp contrast to one she had sent not long after the February episode.
