The producers of “Hamilton,” moving to rebuild the show’s cast in anticipation of the departure of its three leading performers, on Wednesday said that they had cast the two-time Tony nominee Brandon Victor Dixon in the key role of Aaron Burr.
Mr. Odom is leaving the “Hamilton” cast after this Saturday evening’s performance, as are Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the show and plays Alexander Hamilton, and Phillipa Soo, who plays Eliza Hamilton.
Mr. Miranda had previously announced that he would be succeeded by his longtime alternate, Javier Muñoz. On Wednesday, Mr. Seller said that Mr. Muñoz, like Mr. Miranda, would perform seven shows a week, and that the show had cast Michael Luwoye as his alternate for the eighth show. Mr. Luwoye will be making his Broadway debut; he recently appeared Off Broadway in “Invisible Thread” at Second Stage, alongside Mr. Odom’s wife, Nicolette Robinson.
The casting of Mr. Dixon, less than two weeks after the surprise closing announcement for “Shuffle Along,” marks the second time that "Hamilton” has moved swiftly to land an actor who was unexpectedly out of work. In March, less than three weeks after a Broadway production of “Nerds” was cancelled, “Hamilton” announced that it had hired one of that show’s stars, Rory O’Malley, to succeed Jonathan Groff in the role of King George III.
