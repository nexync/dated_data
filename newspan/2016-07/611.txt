Q. Why does my Apple router’s light blink yellow occasionally? It’s not like the modem light that blinks regularly when we are using the internet, but the blinking seems more steady and I don’t lose my network connection.
A. If your router lacks its own display screen, it must communicate through its status light (or lights) and the messages it blinks can vary based on your model and manufacturer. On some routers, like Apple’s line of AirPort base stations, a blinking yellow light is usually a sign that the router needs your attention.
If you have not lost your internet connection, the blinking yellow (or as Apple calls it, “amber”) light can mean that a firmware update is available to install on the AirPort hardware. You can update the base station’s firmware by using the AirPort Utility software that came with it to download the update, connect to the AirPort hardware and install the firmware. If you do not have the app already, versions of the AirPort Utility are available online for Windows and iOS, and the program is included with recent editions of the OS X operating system.
You may also see a blinking yellow light if the AirPort base station has been reset. On AirPort Time Capsule models, the blinking light can also indicate an internal hard-drive error.
If you cannot connect to the internet, the blinking yellow light may mean the cable from the modem to the AirPort device is unplugged or that the internet service from your provider is unavailable. The AirPort + Wi-Fi Support section of Apple’s site has additional troubleshooting information.
Other router manufacturers like Linksys and Netgear have their own online guides to interpreting the meaning of a flashing amber light on the router. Depending on the company, a blinking light could mean that the router’s firmware is corrupted and needs to be reinstalled, but check the support area of the website for a guide to your specific model.
