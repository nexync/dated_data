“Oslo,” an engrossing drama about a key chapter in the long and largely unsuccessful history of efforts to broker Middle East peace, will transfer to Broadway next spring.
The play opened Off Broadway, to uniformly positive reviews, on July 11 at Lincoln Center Theater’s 288-seat Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. Lincoln Center Theater said on Wednesday that the Off Broadway run, which is sold out, would end as scheduled on Aug. 28, but that the show would reopen next year, with the same cast, at the nonprofit’s Vivian Beaumont Theater, configured for about 1,060 seats.
The larger theater, despite being located at Lincoln Center, is considered a Broadway house, and the transfer means that the play will be eligible for Tony Awards next year. The Broadway run is scheduled to begin previews March 23 and to open April 13.
“Oslo” was written by J. T. Rogers, making it the rare play by a living American playwright to be presented on today’s Broadway, which is dominated by musicals and play revivals. Only one other new play by an American writer — “Significant Other,” by Joshua Harmon — has been announced thus far for the 2016-17 Broadway season.
The play — about the unusual back story to the 1993 Oslo peace accords — has an unusual back story itself. Bartlett Sher, who was directing Mr. Rogers’s previous play, “Blood and Gifts,” introduced Mr. Rogers in 2012 to a friend who was a Norwegian diplomat; that began a long research process by Mr. Rogers that resulted in “Oslo.” The play, which describes the little-known role played by a Norwegian couple in facilitating back-channel talks that led to the Oslo accords, is also directed by Mr. Sher.
