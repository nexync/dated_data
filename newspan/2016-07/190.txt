All nail salons in New York State will be required to have ventilation systems to protect manicurists and others from the potentially dangerous health effects of chemicals used in nail products, the governor announced this week.
The new rule is among the most sweeping changes in the state’s initiative, more than a year long, to make the industry safer and more equitable for workers, many of whom say they suffer ill health effects as a result of their jobs.
Any nail salon that opens on Oct. 3 or later will have to have a ventilation system. Existing salons will have five years to comply.
The expense of installing new ventilation will be borne entirely by salon owners, Alphonso David, the counsel to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said in an interview. Some salon owners have challenged previous new salon regulations as financially burdensome for small businesses.
With each dab of polish, slick of topcoat and swipe of acetone-soaked cotton balls, the manicure process entails a slurry of chemicals that make painted nails shiny, durable and removable. But many of those chemicals are known irritants to airways, eyes and skin, and some are tied to more serious ailments such as miscarriage, harm to a fetus and even cancer.
The rules are part of a series of reforms put in place after the publication of a two-part series in The New York Times last year detailing underpayment and exploitation in New York’s nail salon industry, and the damaging health effects manicurists said they experienced.
The state has acted despite the fact that research is limited on the extent to which nail salon workers are exposed to harmful chemicals and whether a connection can be drawn between them and workers’ health, something that Mr. David, the governor’s counsel, acknowledged. “What we didn’t want to do was spend the next three years doing exhaustive scientific research and analysis and having people exposed to dangerous chemicals in the meantime,” he said.
