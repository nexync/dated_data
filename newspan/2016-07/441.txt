On the eve of two milestones — her directorial debut, his first book in a decade — the famous actress and acclaimed novelist open up their inboxes.
The actress (and cover of T’s Summer Entertainment issue) stars in a surrealist short film by Craig McDean and Masha Vasyukova.
Why do I mention all of this? Because the garbage and parking are among the many rituals around which my daily life is organized. Some are imposed (like school pick-up times), some are self-originating if meaningless (like buying a seltzer every day on the way to pick-up) and some were created for the purpose of adding deliberateness and meaning to life. For the last half a year, we have played a game at dinner called the Wonder Line. If one of the kids can tell me something that generates the experience of wonder — the cocked head, slight nod, raised eyebrow and muttered “hmmm ...” — we call it “clearing the Wonder Line.” If they can clear it five times, they get to decide how we end the night, i.e., have ice cream, or watch a “Pirates of the Caribbean” iteration.
It must be terribly difficult to establish rituals in your life. (Night shooting at 3:30 in the morning ...) I know you don’t have an “average day,” but what have you tried to ritualize in your work and home life? And so long as the subject has been raised, what has cleared your Wonder Line in the past couple of weeks?
Children, animals, music, food, artistic camaraderie ... that’s five! Now do I get an ice cream? Happy Thursday.
