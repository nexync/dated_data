What do Mount Everest and 1 World Trade Center have in common? Jimmy Chin has climbed both.
One afternoon in April, Chin, equipped with a virtual-reality camera rig, finally made his ascent to the top of the 408-foot-tall spire of 1 World Trade Center.
His mission was to capture a cover image for the magazine’s special New York Issue, all about life at 800 feet and above. He spent nearly five hours on the spire, as the sun set and the lights of the city came on, filming and taking pictures from one of the most inaccessible views of the city.
See it for yourself in this new virtual-reality film from The New York Times Magazine.
