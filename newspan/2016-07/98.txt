LONDON — Patti Smith, Ben Whishaw, Ralph Fiennes and the novelist Colm Toibin are among the artists who will read from Oscar Wilde’s “De Profundis,” in the prison in which he wrote it.
The artists will appear this fall as part of “Inside — Artists and Writers in Reading Prison,” an exhibition and reading series organized by the immersive art group Artangel, in the prison in Reading, England, where Wilde served a sentence in the 1890s. He was convicted of gross indecency because of his homosexuality. During his time there he wrote “De Profundis,” a lengthy meditation on his spirituality and his relationship with his lover Lord Alfred Douglas.
Newly commissioned art by Steve McQueen, Marlene Dumas, Wolfgang Tillmans and others, inspired by the prison, will be part of “Inside.” New letters about lovers kept apart by public authorities, by writers including Anne Carson and Jeanette Winterson, will also be on view at sites around the prison.
The event runs from Sept. 4 through Oct. 30. Artangel helps organize big public art projects like “spectra,” a giant, vertical beam of light that shone into the sky above London in 2014; and the artist PJ Harvey’s public recording of music at Somerset House in London.
It’s the first time the prison, which was in use until 2013, will be open to the public.
