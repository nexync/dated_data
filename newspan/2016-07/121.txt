In 1956, Diane Arbus labeled a roll of 35-millimeter film “#1,” as if aware that she was embarking on something important. But she could not have known that the next seven years would prove to be a definitive chapter of her photography career, that she would evolve from capturing people on camera in chance encounters to portraits in which the subjects became collaborative participants.
Now the images from this period, many of which have never been seen, are coming to the Met Breuer in an exhibition, “Diane Arbus: In the Beginning,” that opens on Tuesday, July 12. Most of the photographs in the show are part of the Diane Arbus Archive, which the Met acquired in 2007 from the artist’s daughters.
