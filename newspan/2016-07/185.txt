In February 2016, the photographer Luca Locatelli traveled to Mecca during umrah, a minor pilgrimage that can be made for much of the year. He received permission from the Saudi Arabian authorities to document the trip.
The author Basharat Peer wrote about Mr. Locatelli’s photographs for The New York Times Magazine in June, in a piece called “Mecca Goes Mega” that focused on the building boom transforming the sacred city’s center.
Mr. Locatelli, an Italian who was raised Catholic, gained entry to Mecca through his marriage to an Indonesian Muslim, which included a ceremonial conversion, Mr. Peer wrote.
“In his striking images, you can see experiences shared by pilgrims everywhere as well as the mix of crass commercialism and genuine faith common among holy sites across religions,” Mr. Peer wrote.
He also noted that when Mr. Locatelli first arrived in Mecca, he was anxious about his outsider status.
