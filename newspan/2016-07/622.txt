Pikachu is having his John Travolta moment.
Pikachu, as you probably know, is a beloved character in the Pokémon universe, which has for two decades entertained millions through video games, cartoons, books, lunchboxes, toys, posters, backpacks, T-shirts and alarming furry costumes for adults.
And then, of course, came his star turn in “Pulp Fiction” in 1994, and Mr. Travolta was back in the spotlight, bigger than ever.
Thanks to the wild success of the new Pokémon Go game, millions are yet again paying attention to the lovable, yellow anime character. The director Oliver Stone has even mused that the augmented reality game is a troubling sign that as a society we are sliding into techno-totalitarianism. Or something like that. Mr. Stone was promoting an upcoming movie about techno-totalitarianism, so the connection probably made sense when he said it.
On Wednesday night, a crowd estimated to be in the hundreds (though not the thousands some had expected) gathered in San Francisco for a group Pokémon hunt. It was, as David Streitfeld writes, a bit of harmless fun — a tent pole amusement for a society that could use some lighter moments.
That is, assuming no one wandered into traffic, fell off a cliff, failed to notice a mugger behind them, or any of the other mishaps that have befallen Pokémon gamers.
