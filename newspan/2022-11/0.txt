On Thursday, the 96th annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade wended its way across the West Side of Manhattan once again. Its retinue of giant helium balloon characters, from SpongeBob SquarePants to Bluey the dog, bobbed across a perfect blue sky.
“They are not freaks, not clowns; they are perfect just the way they are!” she said.
On this Thanksgiving Day, though her father has passed away, he was with her — she brought a photo of him to New York City and propped it in her hotel window in Herald Square, overlooking the parade route. “We are still watching it together,” Ms. Redding said through tears.
“A parade put on by a commercial house should not be allowed that day,” The Times wrote on Nov. 4, 1926, attributing the sentiment to a man named Hugh White Adams, a member of the Allied Patriotic Societies. That year, a group of religious societies had voiced objections to the spectacle’s potential to interfere with Christian worship on the holiday.
Ninety-six years and 20 days after Mr. Adams’s thoughts were published, Lennox Skyers, age 12, begged to differ. “It is a celebration,” the seventh grader from the Upper West Side of Manhattan said, standing behind police barricades at 62nd Street. “It worships God too, because it is about being thankful for giving,” Lennox said.
Ramcharan Jhagen, 9, was giddy for his first-ever in-person glimpse of a parade he had previously watched only from his home in Michigan. He marveled at the idea that 98 years ago a fourth grader like him must have watched this very parade. The event, which took a few years off during World War II, had obviously evolved, Ramcharan was quick to point out.
