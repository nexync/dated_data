SARAH CONNOLLY at Park Avenue Armory (March 15, 7:30 p.m.; March 17, 8 p.m.). With her accompanist Joseph Middleton, the outstanding British mezzo-soprano takes on a daunting program, comprising Schumann’s “Frauenliebe und -leben,” Berlioz’s “Les nuits d’été,” Poulenc’s “Banalités,” and works by Copland and Richard Rodney Bennett.
‘FIDELIO’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 16, 7:30 p.m.; through April 8). Beethoven’s paean to freedom, and his only opera, returns to the Met in a classic production by Jürgen Flimm, and with a superb cast. Adrianne Pieczonka is the heroine, Leonore, and Klaus Florian Vogt sings Florestan. Hanna-Elisabeth Müller makes her house debut as Marzelline, Falk Struckmann is Rocco, and Günther Groissböck is Don Fernando.
RICHARD GOODE at Carnegie Hall (March 15, 8 p.m.). A thought-provoking recital from one of our most distinguished pianists pairs Bach and Chopin, two composers who don’t instantly spring to mind as natural partners but might well turn out to be. Bach is represented by the Partita No. 6 in E minor and excerpts from the second book of the “Well-Tempered Clavier”; Chopin, by a ballade, a barcarolle and an assortment of nocturnes and mazurkas.
‘OTELLO’ at LightSpace Studios (March 16, 8 p.m.; through March 27). No, not that one — the other one. LoftOpera continues its taste for the less explored by staging Rossini’s “Otello” rather than Verdi’s, in a close-up production by John de los Santos that is conducted by Sean Kelly. Bernard Holcomb is Otello; Cecilia Lopez, his Desdemona.
‘UNREMEMBERED’ at National Sawdust (March 14, 7 p.m.). Sarah Kirkland Snider’s “Unremembered” is a song cycle for seven voices, dwelling on memories of early life through settings of poetry by Nathaniel Bellows. With video projections, it’s performed here by the Knights, a versatile ensemble, and singers including Shara Nova.
