WASHINGTON — After eight years of chafing under President Barack Obama’s fiscal priorities, congressional Republicans were longing for a budget proposal that did the two things that have become the party’s mantra: Make broad cuts to federal spending and reduce the federal deficit.
Instead, President Trump sent them a budget even many Republicans found difficult to love.
To fulfill a campaign promise to leave Social Security and Medicare — which represent more than 40 percent of annual federal spending — untouched while constructing an expensive border wall, Mr. Trump went after a relatively small pot of money, discretionary spending, goring Republicans’ pet programs in the process.
He does propose increasing military spending by 10 percent, something many conservatives would also like to see, but he probably cannot unilaterally break through legal budget caps, imposed after a battle in 2011 over raising the government’s statutory borrowing limit known as the debt ceiling.
Mr. Trump ran as a populist and stacked his cabinet like a conservative, yet he delivered a budget that in many respects is neither. The result is deeply unsatisfying for many in his party, which has been yearning for a unified government to finally make major changes to entitlement programs to bring the deficit in line.
Congress could have eliminated every penny of domestic spending at its annual discretion this year, and it would not have balanced the federal budget, according to Congressional Budget Office projections, much less rid the nation of its nearly $20 trillion in government debt — which Mr. Trump told voters he could do easily in eight years.
It is precisely what conservatives have wanted to control.
Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump’s budget director, who as a member of the House was one of the biggest deficit hawks, was confronted with the budget’s failure to deal with the debt in a news conference with reporters on Thursday.
The budget document represents a broad-brush aspiration for Mr. Trump, leaving it to the House and Senate appropriations committees to do all the painful work, like finding a way to pay for a wall along the Mexican border that the White House wants.
The president’s plan would cut spending for many agencies to historically low levels.
But trying to pass appropriations bills with large cuts to popular domestic programs seems almost impossible in both chambers, especially the Senate, leading Congress on another path to short-term spending measures that Republicans have long wanted to escape.
The Congressional Budget Office foresees a federal deficit for the 2018 fiscal year of $487 billion, rising steadily from there until it reaches $1 trillion in 2023. But that is driven all by an aging population, rising health care costs and rising interest payments from the escalating debt.
Projected declines in discretionary spending under Mr. Trump’s plan would be more than swallowed by rising payments to Social Security and Medicare because the population aged 65 and older is expected to grow by 39 percent through 2027. In that time, spending on people 65 and older who receive Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and military and federal civilian retirement income will rise from 37 percent of federal spending in 2017 to 45 percent in 10 years.
And many of his proposed cuts are at odds with congressional priorities.
His budget cuts spending for the National Institutes of Health, which lawmakers gave a big funding increase last year to help attack cancer and other diseases; community block grants, which help feed hungry children (a Democratic priority); and local law enforcement (popular with Republicans); as well as pet programs like funding to care for the Great Lakes, which Midwestern lawmakers have fought hard to maintain.
Mr. Trump’s budget also shows little regard for the political sensitivities of his party. His proposal to restart licensing for a nuclear waste repository in Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, creates a headache for Senator Dean Heller, a Republican who is up for re-election in that state next year. His response was swift and blunt. “As has been stated in the past, Yucca is dead, and this reckless proposal will not revive it,” he said in a statement.
It even takes an ax to programs that are important to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, by proposing cuts in funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission and some air service that would probably eliminate two airports in his state.
Mr. McConnell on Thursday went in search of a silver lining.
Mr. Trump is hardly alone in putting forth a budget dismissed by his own party. Mr. Obama pushed the idea of changing the way the inflation rate was calculated to slow the growth of big programs like Social Security, a proposal many Democrats opposed. President George W. Bush pressed to partially privatize Social Security, and many Republicans disliked that idea.
But it is striking to read Mr. Trump’s budget and see clearly mixed messages from the opening pages delivered by Mr. Mulvaney, who praised the budget as a debt crusher, and from Mr. Trump, who emphasized his increases in military spending.
Those contradictions are among the many reasons that even members of Mr. Trump’s party see his budget more as a mere suggestion than an edict.
“Historically, presidential budgets do not fare well with Congress,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
