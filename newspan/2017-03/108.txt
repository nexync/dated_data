The punishment is, more or less, unrelenting on “You Will Never Be One of Us,” the latest album from the Oxnard, Calif., band Nails, which plays fast and loose with the most belligerent group of subgenres, from grindcore to death metal to powerviolence and beyond.
At 21 minutes, this is the longest of the group’s three full-length releases, and the only one that tempers the band’s ferocity with even a hint of breathing space. Even still, Todd Jones’s screaming remains guttural and cathartic as ever, a reassuring rage that remains undimmed.
