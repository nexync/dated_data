Villanova, last season’s national champion, will enter the N.C.A.A. tournament with a conference tournament title and probably the No. 1 overall seed.
The senior guard Josh Hart scored 29 points on Saturday to lead second-ranked Villanova to a 74-60 victory over Creighton in the Big East title game at Madison Square Garden.
Good defense, a willingness to share the ball and 3-point shooting provide the formula that has led Villanova (31-3) to four consecutive Big East regular-season titles. It was Villanova’s third Big East tournament crown, the others coming in 1995 and 2015.
“We might have played our best defensive game of the year,” Coach Jay Wright said.
Hart, the conference player of the year, became just the third player to win the tournament’s Most Valuable Player Award twice, joining Patrick Ewing of Georgetown and Peyton Siva of Louisville.
Hart and his fellow seniors Kris Jenkins and Darryl Reynolds have posted a record of 128-16 in their four seasons.
On Saturday, the top-seeded Wildcats got their hands on many Creighton passes, forcing a season-high 17 turnovers. Hart scored in every way imaginable, from 3-pointers to acrobatic drives. Jalen Brunson scored 17 points and Jenkins 14.
Cole Huff and Marcus Foster each scored 13 points to lead sixth-seeded Creighton (25-9).
Villanova, which lost last season’s Big East championship game to Seton Hall, closed the first half on a 25-11 run. Once the lead reached 46-26, the Bluejays never got closer than 12 points.
