• Trump’s revised travel ban is blocked.
A federal judge in Hawaii has stopped President Trump’s ban on travel from six predominantly Muslim countries from taking effect nationwide. A second judge in Maryland also ruled against a portion of the ban overnight.
The rulings were the second setback for Mr. Trump’s pursuit of a policy he says is critical for national security. His first attempt was also blocked by courts.
In his decision on the new, narrower ban, the judge in Honolulu wrote that it appeared “to disfavor a particular religion.” (Here are some highlights from the judicial order.) “This ruling makes us look weak,” Mr. Trump responded.
• White House budget favors military.
Mr. Trump will send a budget to Congress today that would increase spending for the Pentagon and on defending the southern border, while cutting funds for foreign aid, poverty programs and the environment.
The president’s proposal represents an “America First” budget that, in one reporter’s analysis, makes parts of America more first than others. We look at who wins and who loses (including arts groups whose government funding would be eliminated).
• Republicans reject Trump’s wiretap claims.
Lawmakers threatened subpoenas and vented about the lack of evidence behind Mr. Trump’s accusation on Twitter that President Barack Obama had wiretapped phones in Trump Tower during the campaign.
If the president’s comments are taken literally, he is simply “wrong,” one Republican said.
• Refining the G.O.P. health law.
Mr. Trump urged his supporters to unite behind the Republican plan to overhaul health care, but Speaker Paul D. Ryan, facing resistance to the bill within his party, said it would be refined and improved.
• Far-right candidate falters in the Netherlands.
The party of the populist politician Geert Wilders gained seats in Parliament in Dutch elections on Wednesday but fell short of expectations.
Voters turned out in record numbers, and the result was cheered by those hoping to stall the anti-European Union, anti-Muslim forces that Mr. Wilders symbolizes.
• Letter bomb explodes in Paris.
At least one person was “lightly wounded” on Thursday after opening an envelope at the International Monetary Fund’s offices in the French capital, according to the police.
In today’s show: Republican presidents have long pledged to roll back regulation, but for Mr. Trump, it’s personal.

• A grim fate for a natural wonder.
Scientists say large sections of the Great Barrier Reef, a coral ecosystem off the coast of Australia so large that it can be seen from space, are dead or dying because of rising sea temperatures.
The level of destruction wasn’t expected for another 30 years, the author of a new study said.

• Press freedom in Egypt.
Declan Walsh, our Cairo bureau chief, joined a group of journalists to discuss the difficulties of reporting from the Middle East.
The hosts were not impressed by Rachel Maddow’s anticlimactic revelation of Mr. Trump’s tax forms the day before. “Is this news or a reality show?” asked Stephen Colbert.
A new space race is underway, fueled by billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos who are eager to capitalize on booming technology and the allure of space tourism.
Such audacious plans weren’t always embraced. In 1920, when Robert H. Goddard outlined how a rocket might reach the moon, The Times wrote that he seemed “to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools” and argued, incorrectly, that thrust was not possible in a vacuum.
History has been kinder to Dr. Goddard since his death in 1945, and he’s now viewed as a pioneer of the space age.
