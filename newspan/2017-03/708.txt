If the movie industry gave out awards for Most Accurate Title, the Catalan writer and director Albert Serra’s new film would walk away with one. As it happens, Mr. Serra did receive France’s prestigious Jean Vigo award for “The Death of Louis XIV,” which stars Jean-Pierre Léaud as the French monarch.
Louis XIV reigned for 72 years, until his death in 1715. He knew no other life save that of king. Mr. Serra’s depiction of the monarch’s final days shows a mostly bedridden Louis keeping to his dimly lit, ornately appointed bedroom. Bedecked in elaborate clothing and ridiculously oversize hairpieces, he is initially in a relatively content state. He gossips and indulges in what some might call mild locker-room talk with his doctors, asking one whether a certain marquise is beautiful naked. This state doesn’t last. He has night sweats; he calls for water; when water is brought to him, he demands that it be served in a particular piece of crystal. It was perhaps once good to be the king; now it’s confusing. And it will get worse before he gives up the ghost.
Mr. Léaud, who has been a star of French cinema for most of his life (at 13, he created the character of Antoine Doinel in François Truffaut’s 1959 classic, “The 400 Blows”), clearly knows something about living in a kind of box, and he plays Louis as a tired but majestic wreck. He’s riveting, and a little alarming. As for Mr. Serra, while he often enjoys playing the foppish provocateur in his interviews, his film is sober, meticulous and entirely convincing in its depiction of period and mortality.
