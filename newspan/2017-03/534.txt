Ms. Garland’s single, from the 1939 classic movie musical “The Wizard of Oz,” was a breakout hit for her and one of the most enduring ballads by the composer Harold Arlen.
One of Barbra Streisand’s signature songs — the 1964 hit “People,” from Jule Styne and the lyricist Bob Merrill’s musical “Funny Girl” — is also among the registry’s new additions.
Nonmusical recordings include the first episode of NPR’s news program “All Things Considered,” in 1971, and the last game of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds in 1957, announced by Vin Scully.
These additions bring the National Recording Registry’s total to 475 titles since the National Recording Preservation Act was established in 2000. The full list is at the registry’s website.
