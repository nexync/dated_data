You know U.C.L.A., Duke and Kentucky, surely. But the smaller schools that pop up at tournament time may stump you. Here’s where to find them.
If you’re an alumnus of these schools, or a local, you may know their exact locations. If not ...
Creighton is in Omaha. Iona is in New Rochelle, in Westchester County, New York. St. Mary’s is in Moraga, California, in the San Francisco area, just east of Berkeley and Oakland. Troy is in Troy, Alabama, in the southeastern part of the state. Xavier is in Cincinnati.
They’ve been eliminated, but in case you’re wondering: Bucknell is in Lewisburg, in East Central Pennsylvania, not far from Williamsport and the Little League World Series. Mount St. Mary’s is in Emmitsburg, Maryland, in the center of the state by the Pennsylvania border. Winthrop is in Rock Hill, South Carolina, just over the North Carolina border.
Do we really need to tell you where California-Davis, Cincinnati, Dayton, Jacksonville State, Louisville, Miami of Florida, New Orleans, North Carolina-Wilmington, Providence, U.C.L.A., and Wichita State are? Well, maybe Jacksonville State. It’s in Jacksonville, Alabama, not Florida.
These schools fill many of the tournament berths every year: Arizona (Tucson), Arkansas (Fayetteville), Florida (Gainesville), Florida State (Tallahassee), Iowa State (Ames), Nevada (Reno), Vermont (Burlington), Rhode Island (Kingston), Oregon (Eugene), Michigan (Ann Arbor), Oklahoma State (Stillwater), North Carolina (Chapel Hill), Kansas (Lawrence), Kansas State (Manhattan), Kentucky (Lexington), Maryland (College Park), Michigan State (East Lansing), Minnesota (St. Paul), New Mexico State (Las Cruces), North Dakota (Grand Forks), South Carolina (Columbia), South Dakota State (Brookings), Virginia (Charlottesville), Virginia Tech (Blacksburg), West Virginia (Morgantown) and Wisconsin (Madison).
