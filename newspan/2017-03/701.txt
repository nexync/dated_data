A day after federal officials indicted four men — two of whom were Russian intelligence agents — on charges they hacked into the internet company Yahoo and breached 500 million customer accounts, a portrait emerged of one of the suspects.
Dmitry A. Dokuchaev, a Russian intelligence officer who was one of the two agents who allegedly directed the Yahoo attack, was once known by the hacker nickname Forb and had specialized in purloining credit card numbers, writes Andrew E. Kramer, a Moscow correspondent for The New York Times.
Mr. Dokuchaev, 33, was a hacker-turned-agent who has been in and out of legal trouble — and his latest indictment may be the least of his worries. While American officials have claimed that Mr. Dokuchaev hacked Yahoo to help the Russian government, Russian authorities have accused him of being a double agent for the United States. He was arrested four months ago in Russia on charges of treason.
No matter how these cases are resolved, Mr. Dokuchaev would seem to face a future that is not exactly bright.
“He’s a guy without many options,” Pavel Vrublevsky, a computer entrepreneur and owner of an online payment processing company in Russia who was investigated by Mr. Dokuchaev, told The Times.
