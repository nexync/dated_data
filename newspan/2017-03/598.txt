William Shatner has a birthday today.
A Canadian, Mr. Shatner trained as a Shakespearean actor before moving into TV and film.
In the mid-60s, the first pilot of the show was rejected by television executives, but the second, in which Mr. Shatner played Kirk for the first time, fared better.
“I never thought it’d become a big deal, just 13 episodes and out,” Mr. Shatner told The Times Magazine in 2010.
In fact, it lasted 79. The show gained a cult following in syndication and spawned a pop cultural phenomenon that boasts multiple television series (with a new one planned) as well as 13 feature films (and counting).
Mr. Shatner turns 86 today, but James Tiberius Kirk won’t be born for another 216 years.
