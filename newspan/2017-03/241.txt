With federal arts funding in jeopardy, arts groups large and small held fund-raisers within the past week. The School of American Ballet held its winter ball on March 6 at Lincoln Center. The Anthology Film Archives had a gala at Capitale on March 2. The Atlantic Theater Company hosted a gala at the Pierre on March 6. And the dance and arts collective MoveOpolis held a benefit at New York Live Arts on March 8.
