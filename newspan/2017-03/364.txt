RICHMOND, Va. — The Virginia governor has pardoned four former sailors who became known as the Norfolk Four, ending a decades-long fight to clear them of rape and murder convictions based on intimidating police interrogations.
Brian Coy, a spokesman for Gov. Terry McAuliffe, said Tuesday that the governor had granted absolute pardons to the men in the 1997 rape and killing of Michelle Moore-Bosko. DNA evidence linked another man, Omar Ballard, to the crimes. Mr. Ballard, who said he was solely responsible for the attack, is serving a life sentence.
The Norfolk Four were stationed at the Navy base in Norfolk. Their case drew widespread attention when their claims of innocence were backed by dozens of former F.B.I. agents, former prosecutors and the crime novelist John Grisham.
“These pardons close the final chapter on a grave injustice that has plagued these four men for nearly 20 years,” Mr. Coy said.
Three of the men — Danial J. Williams, Joseph Dick Jr. and Derek Tice — were granted conditional pardons in 2009 by Gov. Tim Kaine and released from prison because of doubts about their guilt, but their convictions remained. The fourth man, Eric Wilson, who was convicted only of rape, had already been released.
Mr. Wilson failed to get his conviction overturned because he had already completed his sentence when he brought the challenge.
A federal judge vacated the convictions of Mr. Williams and Mr. Dick in October, declaring that “no sane human being” could find them guilty. Mr. Tice had his convictions erased in 2009.
Lawyers for the men argued that absolute pardons carried greater weight than court rulings and were essential to helping the men rebuild their lives and reputations. They had long said they confessed only after being intimidated by the police.
The detective who questioned the men, Robert Glenn Ford, was convicted in 2011 of extortion and lying to the F.B.I. in unrelated cases.
