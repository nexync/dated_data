“How Sweet the Sound: The Blind Boys of Alabama” tells the story of the Grammy-winning gospel group, which goes back a very long way — the Blind Boys released their first single in 1948. The film, the closing-night feature on Wednesday, March 8, at JCC Manhattan’s ReelAbilities Film Festival, relates how the original members came together in the 1930s at an Alabama school for deaf or blind black students. But they almost didn’t get off the ground: Early on, their leader, Velma Traylor, was killed in a shooting accident.
