Nicholas Mosley, an experimental writer whose 1965 novel “Accident” became the basis for a Joseph Losey film with a screenplay by Harold Pinter, and who wrote an unsparing two-volume biography of his father, the fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, died on Feb. 28 at his home in London. He was 93.
The death was confirmed by his son Marius.
Mr. Mosley spent much of his life in the malign shadow of his father, a onetime Labour member of Parliament who founded the British Union of Fascists in 1932. The party openly supported Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, promoted anti-Semitism and engaged in violent clashes with opponents.
Sir Oswald and his wife, Diana Guinness, one of the Mitford sisters, were interned in 1940, and the party was banned. (Sir Oswald’s first wife, the former Lady Cynthia Curzon, died when Nicholas, her son, was 9.) The couple spent three years in a house on the grounds of Holloway Prison and, after being released, lived under house arrest for the remainder of the war.
Nicholas, known as Nick, distanced himself from his father. After leaving Eton, he was commissioned as a captain in a rifle regiment and saw action in Italy. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1944.
