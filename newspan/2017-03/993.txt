“Full Frontal,” a topical satire hosted by Ms. Bee, ran the segment on Wednesday. It featured Michael Rubens, a correspondent for the show, attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.
The narrator added: “This year, the bow ties were gone and replaced by Nazi hair. Nazi hair. Nazi hair.” Each time the phrase was spoken, an image was shown of conference attendees with short haircuts.
One of those people was Kyle Coddington, a writer who contributes to publications like OUTSET, which covers conservative and libertarian politics and culture.
In tweets posted early Thursday morning and directed at Ms. Bee, Mr. Coddington wrote: “Please delete this episode. I look like a balding potato.” He added: “Also, it’s not a Nazi haircut. Richard Spencer’s is, but mine’s from cancer.
On Thursday afternoon, “Full Frontal” had removed the segment from public viewing on its YouTube site, though Mr. Perkins had embedded it in his OUTSET post.
Mr. Coddington and Mr. Perkins did not immediately respond to requests for further comment on Thursday afternoon.
