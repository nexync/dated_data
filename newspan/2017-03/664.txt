Good morning on this mild Monday.
If you’re planning to buy a MetroCard this morning, be prepared to pay more.
• A monthly MetroCard has increased by $4.50 to $121.
• A weekly MetroCard has increased by $1 to $32.
• The base fare for subways and buses remains $2.75, but the bonus you get when you put at least $5.50 on a MetroCard drops to 5 percent, from 11 percent.
• Fares are also rising on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad, and tolls are increasing on the authority’s tunnels and bridges. Find detailed information on the authority’s website.
The M.T.A. has raised fares every two years to offset the rising costs of providing service. With growing concerns over the affordability of living in New York, mass-transit advocates have called on Mayor Bill de Blasio to budget for a program to offer reduced fares for low-income riders.
The subway fare increase comes at a time when there are more delays and more crowding in train cars. Since 2012, subway delays have more than doubled to about 70,000 per month.
We made it: Today is the first day of spring.
We’re in for a chilly week, but a lovely one.
Though it might feel as nippy as 25 degrees with the wind this morning, highs will climb to 53 later today — and the sunshine is here to stay for the foreseeable future.
• Scoreboard: Mavericks tangle Nets, 111-104. Blue Jackets fire Devils, 4-1. Seattle Sounders buck New York Red Bulls, 3-1.

• LinkNYC doesn’t record the sites you visit or share your information with third parties. But the time you spend on the network and your phone type are stored for up to 60 days.
• The USB power source does only that — charge your phone.
• And those security cameras on the sides of the kiosk? Footage is only stored for up to seven days, unless it’s needed to investigate an incident.
But even with assurances that your privacy is protected, you may want to exercise caution. If the recent WikiLeaks release tells us anything, it’s that hackers can use all kinds of tools to break into your smartphone.
However you connect, here are some ways you can protect your personal information online.
