Recreational cannabis may be legal in California, but buying the actual stuff still makes Scott Campbell, a celebrity tattoo artist and fine artist, feel like a class-cutting teenage stoner.
“You go in to buy weed, and it’s like visiting your parole officer,” said Mr. Campbell, who lives in Los Angeles. “You get buzzed through three metal gates.” Inside, cannabis products are often packaged with loopy Deadhead-style graphics and goofy dorm-humor strain names like Gorilla Glue and Purple Urkle.
Mr. Campbell hopes to change that with Beboe, an upscale line of cannabis vaporizers and edible pastilles that he founded with Clement Kwan, a former fashion executive, that caters to design-savvy professionals who value premium goods manufactured with an artisanal sensibility.
Beboe products are sleek in design and come in only one color — rose gold.
