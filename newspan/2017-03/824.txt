Adam Leonti, the former chef de cuisine at Vetri in Philadelphia, who came to New York to be the executive chef at Harvey, a restaurant yet to open in the Williamsburg Hotel in Brooklyn, has resigned from that project and will become the executive chef at Sessanta, John McDonald’s restaurant in the Sixty SoHo Hotel.
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Leonti said he had been waiting two years for Harvey to open. “It did not seem right anymore, so I left,” he said.
Mr. McDonald had been looking for a new chef for six months after Jordan Frosolone, Sessanta’s original chef, left. “Adam is very much aligned with my vision, “ Mr. McDonald said.
Mr. Leonti said his food would “follow the seasons” throughout Italy, taking its cue from the south in summer and the north in fall and winter. He is returning to New York this week, and his menu should begin to emerge next month.
