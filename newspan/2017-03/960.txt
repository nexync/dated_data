Good morning on this wonky Wednesday.
An early spring means early thoughts of getting into shape — but this recent wet weather has left us feeling meh.
In search of motivation, we reached out to ClassPass, a subscription service that offers access to gyms and studios across the city.
The company recently surveyed members to ask which of New York’s fitness instructors were the most motivating, or had made a difference in members’ lives. ClassPass shared the results with us.
We took classes taught by some of the most popular trainers and asked them for advice on getting the most out of our workouts.
Do you have a favorite fitness instructor who motivates you? Let us know how in the comments.
It should eventually shape up to be a wonderful day to exercise — and to do so outside.
While you might run (pun intended) into some drizzle on your early commute, the morning clouds should make way for sunshine and a high near 60 by the afternoon.
• Scoreboard: Blue Jackets dress down Devils, 2-0. Rangers tame Panthers, 5-2. Islanders grease Oilers, 4-1.
• Mr. de Blasio visits the Brooklyn Navy Yard to speak about the coming start of the Citywide Ferry Service. 11 a.m.
• Nets at Hawks, 7:30 p.m. (YES). Knicks at Bucks, 8 p.m. (MSG).
The Orchid Show at the New York Botanical Garden made us wonder: How is it that the garden can keep hundreds of orchids flourishing in inhospitable New York and we can’t even keep one alive on our desk?
We asked Marc Hachadourian, the director of the Nolen Greenhouses and curator of the orchid collection at the botanical garden, for advice on caring for a common potted moth orchid.
• Avoid direct sunlight. To test whether your light is indirect enough, place your hand about six inches above the petals. Your shadow on the plant should be fuzzy, not sharp.
• Keep the plant in an area with a temperature between 55 and 85 degrees.
• Rinse the flower. These orchids grow on the branches of trees, so try to mimic these conditions when watering. Bring the flower to the sink and run warm water over it until the water flows out of the pot. Let the plant become almost dry before watering it again.
• And don’t give up. “When the flowers die off people think they’ve killed it,” said Mr. Hachadourian, who added that the plants can flower once a year if cared for properly.
For more tips, you can call the Plant Information Department at the botanical garden. The American Orchid Society also offers information on orchid care.
