Dhammakaya is the biggest and most influential temple in Thailand. It has gained traction, especially among lower-middle classes, thanks to a kind of Buddhist prosperity gospel that advocates meditation, volunteering and donations. It repackages traditional Buddhist concepts in accessible form, including carnival-like pilgrimages and TV shows. Its main building looks like a giant U.F.O. Dhammakaya is said to have three million followers, including powerful politicians and businesspeople.
