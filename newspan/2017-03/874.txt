Chris Whipple’s “The Gatekeepers” is a new look at how these right-hand men (all thus far have been men) have advised, cautioned and encouraged presidents. And one another: When Rahm Emanuel was about to start the job for Barack Obama in the face of the 2008 financial crisis, the severity of the moment brought together a cadre of former chiefs of staff to give him counsel: Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney (who had both served under Gerald Ford), Leon Panetta and John Podesta (Bill Clinton), and others. Ken Duberstein, who had advised Ronald Reagan, told Emanuel: “Always remember, that when you open your mouth, it is not you but the president who is speaking.” To which a shaken Emanuel responded with one of his trademark David Mamet-like exclamations.
Richard Holmes was just 28 when he published “Shelley: The Pursuit,” in 1974. The massive revisionist life of the Romantic poet immediately established Holmes as a major biographer. Reviewing the book in The Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said it “radically altered” our vision of the poet, and praised its “contemporary pertinence” and “extraordinary drama,” among other qualities. Books about Coleridge and other subjects followed, and in 2009 Holmes published “The Age of Wonder,” a sprawling account of both poetry and science in 19th-century Britain. In the Book Review, Christopher Benfey called it “luminous and horizon-expanding,” and it made our list as one of the 10 Best Books of 2009.
