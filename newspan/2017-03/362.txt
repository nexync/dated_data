“My Fair Lady,” which won the Tony for best new musical in 1957, will return to Broadway next year for the first time in a quarter century.
Lincoln Center Theater said Monday that it would stage a revival of the musical, directed by Bartlett Sher, who has become the nonprofit organization’s go-to director for revivals of midcentury classics.
The show, as any theater lover knows, is about a working-class flower saleswoman, Eliza Doolittle, who is taking speech lessons from a professor named Henry Higgins. Set in and around London in 1912, it is based on a play, “Pygmalion,” by George Bernard Shaw.
The original production of “My Fair Lady,” featuring music by Frederick Loewe and a book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, opened on Broadway in 1956, starring Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison, and by the time it closed, in 1962, it was the longest-running musical in Broadway history, with 2,717 performances. There were Broadway revivals in 1976, 1981, and 1993, and the New York Philharmonic staged a production in 2007. But the show is probably best known from the 1964 film adaptation, which starred Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison and won eight Academy Awards in 1965, including best picture.
The revival of “My Fair Lady” is scheduled to begin previews on March 22, 2018, and to open on April 19, 2018, at Lincoln Center’s Vivian Beaumont Theater. The cast has not yet been chosen.
