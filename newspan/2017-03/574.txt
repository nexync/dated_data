This summer, Isabella Boylston, the American Ballet Theater principal, will realize a dream, to bring ballet to her hometown, Sun Valley, Idaho. Ballet Sun Valley, a three-day event with performances Aug. 22 and 24 at the Sun Valley Pavilion, and free classes for children on Aug. 23, will feature dancers from major companies, including Ballet Theater, New York City Ballet, the Royal Ballet, San Francisco Ballet and the Mariinsky Ballet.
She is hoping that Ballet Sun Valley will turn into an annual event. Along with works by George Balanchine, Alexei Ratmansky, Christopher Wheeldon and Justin Peck — Ms. Boylston will dance the part originally created for Sara Mearns in Mr. Peck’s “The Bright Motion” — there will be a commission by Gemma Bond. Inspired by the idea of a solar eclipse, Ms. Bond’s premiere will be performed by 10 Ballet Theater dancers and features a new score by Judd Greenstein and video designs by Kate Duhamel.
