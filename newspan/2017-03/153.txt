The fashion shows in London, Milan, New York and Paris may have recently come to an end, but festival season is now in full swing. When it comes to street style at these events, different rules apply. The festival look can be a grab-bag of style inspiration, from fast-fashion to vintage finds, and expressive party clothes that can handle the crowds and unpredictable weather conditions. This month, the streets of Austin, Tex., were the backdrop for the fans and artists at South by Southwest, who came to immerse themselves in 10 days of live music and parties.
