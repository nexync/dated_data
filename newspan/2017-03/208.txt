English Soccer Tries to Improve Diversity. Critics Say It Failed.
LONDON — England soccer leaders introduced diversity reforms on Monday, but critics said that they still failed to ensure that minority groups were adequately represented in decision making.
The F.A., England’s governing body for soccer, has been threatened with a loss of public funding unless more women and ethnic minorities are brought into its decision-making process. The House of Commons had declared that it had “no confidence” in the F.A. over its failure to reflect modern society in England.
The F.A. Council will add 11 members to ensure it “better reflects the inclusive and diverse nature of English football,” the association said. The F.A. also plans to guarantee three places for women on its board and restrict members to three terms of three years. But there will not be “proper representation of minority groups” even after the board is redesigned, said Herman Ouseley, the chairman of Kick It Out.
Of the council’s current 122 members, 114 are men, 92 are older than 60, and four are from ethnic minorities. The council, which is being pushed by the F.A. chairman, Greg Clarke, to hold sessions in public, has to approve the proposed changes. It also has to comply with the government’s new code for sports bodies. But ministers must tread a cautious path; FIFA could punish England if there is deemed to be government interference.
Clarke described his blueprint as a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to fundamentally change the way football works” and urged the F.A. Council to pass the changes.
