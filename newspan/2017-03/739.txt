Typically a piece of china for the Passover table from the 1980s would be worth little, if anything, at auction. But this one — of bone china by Spode — belonged to the comedian Joan Rivers and is coming up for sale in April at an auction of seder plates.
The typical seder plate features sections for the symbols of Passover, like bitter herb (usually horseradish), which signifies the bitterness of slavery that Jews experienced in Egypt; or “karpas,” a green vegetable that denotes spring (usually parsley).
Mr. Greenstein’s auction house, J. Greenstein and Company, in Cedarhurst, N.Y., also sold Sammy Davis Jr.’s personal menorah, Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach’s piano and the law professor Alan Dershowitz’s Judaica collection.
