The Cincinnati Opera has announced the United States premiere of “Another Brick in the Wall: The Opera,” capping its 98th season and its first after a $135 million restoration of the Cincinnati Music Hall. Opening in July 2018, “Another Brick in the Wall” features original words and music by Roger Waters of the psychedelic rock band Pink Floyd, whose 1979 album, “The Wall,” inspired the opera. The production made its world premiere at Opéra de Montréal in Quebec on Saturday.
The opera was composed by Julien Bilodeau, and will be directed by Dominic Champagne. It features eight soloists and 48 chorus members, in addition to the 70-piece Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra. The baritone Etienne Dupuis will play the lead, as a “fallen rock star” named Pink, and the orchestra will be conducted by Alain Trudel.
