When Russia sold Alaska to the U.S. 150 years ago today, there was consternation on both sides of the Pacific.
American critics railed at the principal negotiator, Secretary of State William Seward, calling the deal “Seward’s Folly” and “Seward’s Icebox.” Russian newspapers are still denouncing it.

The transaction cost the U.S. only $7.2 million — approximately $125 million today — to the delight of at least one American paper.
“We have made a fair trade,” argued The Charleston Daily News.
