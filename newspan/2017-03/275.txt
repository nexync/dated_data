A year after what would have been her 100th birthday, Jane Jacobs is as relevant as ever. This September marked the publication of “Eyes on the Street,” Robert Kanigel’s biography of the urban activist, and next month, the director Matt Tyrnauer (“Valentino: The Last Emperor”) joins the conversation with the wide release of “Citizen Jane: Battle for the City,” a documentary that establishes Jacobs as a forerunner of today’s ground-up social movements. Through never-before-seen footage and interviews with her friends and admirers, the film revisits Jacobs’s midcentury battle with New York City planner Robert Moses. Where Moses privileged governmental power (and his own), Jacobs favored preservation and the natural order of neighborhood life. In perhaps her greatest victory, she and her followers protested — singing a song Bob Dylan co-wrote for the cause — and ultimately halted Moses’s proposed construction of the Lower Manhattan Expressway, which would have cut through SoHo and Little Italy and altered New York as we know it.
