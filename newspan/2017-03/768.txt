“For Many, College Is the Goal; the Problem Is Getting There” (front page, March 25) underscores the need for more government support, not less, for the set of federal programs that help low-income students prepare for and gain entrance into college.
The too little money allocated for such programs serves only 2 percent of eligible students, yet President Trump’s proposed budget would cut funding by 10 percent and result in a loss of services to 83,000 students.
If the students in the article had gained access to federal programs like Talent Search and Upward Bound, they would have found more support and preparation to take the first steps toward the college education that will both brighten their futures and strengthen our country.
Cutting such badly needed programs is woefully shortsighted in light of the obvious need.
