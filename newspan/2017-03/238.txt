North Korea released a propaganda video this week depicting a United States aircraft carrier and a warplane being destroyed in computer-generated balls of fire, the latest salvo in an escalating war of words between the two nuclear powers.
North Korea’s missiles will be “stabbed into the throat of the carrier,” and the jet will “fall from the sky,” it warns. The video, which also includes images of North Korea’s military and is narrated by a woman, was released by Uriminzokkiri, a state-run media outlet, and posted to YouTube.
Its release coincides with the annual joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea known as Foal Eagle, and comes just days after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson suggested that the United States was open to the possibility of a pre-emptive strike against North Korea.
Mr. Tillerson recently visited Japan, South Korea and China primarily to discuss North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.
By Sunday, the North Koreans had conducted a test of a high-thrust rocket engine and posted the propaganda video to YouTube.
On Monday, North Korea issued a statement from an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman saying the country would not be deterred from developing nuclear weapons.
“The nuclear force is the treasured sword of justice and the most reliable war deterrence to defend the socialist motherland and the life of its people,” said the state-run Korean Central News Agency, quoting the spokesman.
As North Korea has accelerated its weapons programs, it has also ratcheted the virulence of its propaganda. In 2013, Uriminzokkiri released a video depicting attacks on New York and Washington.
North Korea has continued to develop nuclear weapons despite several United Nations Security Council resolutions intended to curb its weapons program by imposing sanctions. Last year, the country conducted two nuclear explosions and more than 20 missile tests. This month, it test-fired a volley of missiles off the coast of Japan.
