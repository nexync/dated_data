Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to open 90 new homeless shelters throughout New York City’s five boroughs deserves wide support.
It is unreasonable to complain about the homeless on the streets of New York, and at the same time oppose the creation of new shelters. But since the homeless problem does not affect only city residents, the mayor should look to the federal and state governments to provide financial assistance for the construction as well as the services that the city will be compelled to provide.
