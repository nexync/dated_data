Today’s introduction comes to us from Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief.
The vote to approve the Oakland Raiders’ move to Las Vegas, though expected by many, prompted outrage in the Bay Area and beyond.
For others, the move was a reminder of the first time the Raiders left Oakland.
The team departed the Bay Area in 1982, decamping to Southern California. Los Angeles granted the team a larger cultural footprint, seen in the Raiders hats and jackets often worn by the rap group N.W.A.
But the Raiders returned north 13 years later thanks to the promise of an expanded stadium. And many citizens of Raider Nation are hoping — and even outright expecting — that the team will once again return, maybe even within a decade or two.
