‘AIDA’ at the Metropolitan Opera (March 23, 7:30 p.m.; through April 20). The Met’s vast, inimitable production of Verdi’s “Aida” returns for its second run of the season, with a wholly changed cast. Krassimira Stoyanova is the new Aida; Violeta Urmana, Amneris; Jorge de León, Radamès; George Gagnidze, Amonasro; James Morris, Ramfis; and Morris Robinson, the King.
AKADEMIE FÜR ALTE MUSIK BERLIN at Zankel Hall (March 23, 7:30 p.m.). Titled “Foreign Affairs,” this program of Telemann, Bach, Handel, Vivaldi and Rebel could be seen as celebrating separate national traditions in 18th-century composition. But, in the hands of one of Europe’s most vibrant period-instrument ensembles, it perhaps better shows diversity in unity, as styles merged and cultures mingled.
MAHAN ESFAHANI at the 92nd Street Y (March 21, 8:30 p.m.). As combative, provocative and sincere an advocate for his instrument as any soloist I know, Mr. Esfahani was once called a “harpsichord ninja” by the BBC. This program shows why, veering happily from the English Renaissance (Tomkins, Farnaby) to the 20th century (Cowell, Kalabis), and even into the rarely explored literature for harpsichord and electronics (Reich).
ELINA GARANCA at Carnegie Hall (March 19, 2 p.m.). We are in the realm of the Romantic with this recital from a star mezzo-soprano and her pianist, Kevin Murphy: songs by Brahms, Rachmaninoff and, most luscious of all, Duparc.
