Rachel Joy Goldfarb and Roberto Juan Carlos Talavera were married March 4 at the Housing Works Bookstore Cafe in New York. Rabbi David L. Kline officiated.
Mrs. Talavera, 31, is a senior designer at LB Architects, a commercial-interior architecture firm in New York. She graduated from Cornell, from which she also received a master’s degree in design and environmental analysis focusing on interiors.
She is a daughter of Michelle M. Goldfarb of East Meadow, N.Y., and Zachary Goldfarb of Great Neck, N.Y.
Mr. Talavera, 35, is a mechanical and energy engineer at AKF Group in New York, an engineering consultancy for public and private projects. He graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in psychology, and, in 2007, graduated with a bachelor’s degree in engineering from the City College of New York.
He is the son of Ileana Talavera and Carlos E. Talavera of Deltona, Fla.
The couple first met in 2010 as members of the Urban Green Council, the New York City chapter of the United States Green Building Council. But they actually spoke to each other a year later, when a mutual friend introduced them at a happy hour gathering at a NoLIta bar in New York.
