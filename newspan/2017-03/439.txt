An exuberant Gustav Klimt garden scene sold at Sotheby’s on Wednesday night for 48 million pounds (about $59.3 million), with fees, bringing the third-highest price for any artwork sold at auction in Europe.
The painting, with an estimate of at least £35 million, was contested by four telephone bidders, reflecting newly energized demand for works by the great names of 20th-century art.
“This was a momentous night for the art market,” said the auctioneer, Helena Newman, chairwoman of Sotheby’s Europe, after her evening sale of Impressionist, modern and Surrealist art, which brought a total of £194.8 million. It was the highest total for any auction staged in London, not accounting for inflation.
This result, together with other strong prices at Christie’s Impressionist and modern sale the previous evening, seemed to signal a strengthening of the international art market. The high-end auctions of contemporary art will be tested in London next week.
“There’s a general sense of investor confidence,” said James Roundell, a director at Dickinson, the London dealers. He pointed out that the Dow Jones index had risen more than 300 points during the day.
Before the auction, Klimt’s flowery painting, “Bauerngarten (Blumengarten)” was bought by Sotheby’s from its owner, David Graham, a Canadian collector based in London.
