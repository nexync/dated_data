Preet Bharara, the former United States attorney in Manhattan who was fired this month by the Trump administration, will join the New York University School of Law on April 1 as a distinguished scholar in residence, the school said on Tuesday.
Mr. Bharara’s position is considered full time, although it would not preclude his taking on other engagements, a school spokesman, Michael Orey, said. Similar positions at the law school are held by other former senior government officials, like Lisa O. Monaco, who was President Barack Obama’s homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, and Anne Milgram, a former New Jersey attorney general.
Mr. Orey said that Mr. Bharara might teach, but that no specifics were yet available. “I fully expect that he will be a presence here on campus, not just a nameplate,” Mr. Orey added.
Seton Hall University School of Law has announced that Paul J. Fishman, the former United States attorney in New Jersey who had also been told to step down, has joined the school as a distinguished visiting fellow.
