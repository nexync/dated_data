QR Brooch (2011) is a gold piece printed with a black matrix bar code that, when scanned, leads to a website with Mr. Bakker’s picture and a poem.
AMSTERDAM — Why make a necklace with the faces of famous people, organized by skin tone from lightest to darkest or, depending on how you look at it, darkest to lightest?
Gijs Bakker, 75, the celebrated Dutch designer of industrial products and jewelry, said he was concerned about the rising tide of racial hatred in the Netherlands and elsewhere in the world.
The name of the necklace, Black to White (2016), which features headshots in enamel on stainless steel, also is the title of his latest exhibition. It first was shown in February at the BorzoGallery in Amsterdam and is now at the Caroline Van Hoek gallery in Brussels, until April 29. The display, with about 25 pieces created in the last seven years explores a range of provocative subjects.
Attack Brooch (2010), for example, is in the shape of a Pakistani suicide bomber’s blast, caught in 2009 on a surveillance video, which Mr. Bakker saw when it was reproduced as a still photo in a Dutch newspaper. “It’s a very elegant brooch that has a horrifying background,” he said.
Mr. Bakker, who founded the collective Droog Design with Renny Ramakers in 1993, also has created high-end chairs, tables, lamps and fruit bowls now in several museum collections.
