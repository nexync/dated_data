Joss Whedon made his name by creating the television series “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” centered on a strong female lead, and he has tried his hand at directing Shakespeare. Now, he is looking at tackling the story of a female superhero: Batgirl.
Mr. Whedon is “nearing a deal to write, direct and produce” a movie revolving around the DC Comics character, Variety said.
Batgirl first appeared in the 1960s, and versions of the superhero have appeared in D.C. comic books since then.
The Whedon film would focus on the “New 52” version of Batgirl, who appeared in the 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, Entertainment Weekly reported on Thursday.
In those comics, a character named Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Police Commissioner Gordon, has experimental surgery after being shot and paralyzed by the Joker, and regains her ability to walk.
The DC Comics deal is a departure for Mr. Whedon from the Marvel comics universe. He recently directed well-received screen versions of Marvel’s “The Avengers” (2012) and “Avengers: Age of Ultron” (2015).
There was no immediate word on casting or a release date for the Warner Bros. project.
A spokesman for Warner Bros. did not immediately respond to an email on Friday requesting comment.
