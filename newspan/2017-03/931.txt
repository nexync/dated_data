His boss was fired, and in effect, so was he. Now Matthew S. Axelrod is moving on.
The former top deputy to the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, who was dismissed by President Trump in January after refusing to enforce his executive order barring travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Mr. Axelrod is joining a major global law firm, Linklaters.
He will be a partner in that 179-year-old British firm’s Washington office, in its white-collar defense practice.
He and Ms. Yates had planned to leave their jobs once Jeff Sessions was confirmed as attorney general. But a week after the Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House issued an order that closed the borders to those from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.
Ms. Yates was abruptly removed on Jan. 30 after telling Justice Department officials not to defend the president’s order. Her dismissal drew comparisons to President Richard M. Nixon’s firing of his attorney general and deputy attorney general over their refusal to dismiss the special prosecutor in the Watergate case.
Unlike those fired predecessors, Ms. Yates was a career prosecutor. She became acting attorney general once Loretta E. Lynch resigned as attorney general on Inauguration Day.
Mr. Axelrod, 46, will be part of a growing team of lawyers that the London-based Linklaters is assembling in the United States to handle foreign corrupt practice cases as well as securities fraud, money laundering, health care fraud and white collar crime cases.
A graduate of Yale Law School, Mr. Axelrod served as a federal prosecutor in Miami, where he won the 2006 conviction of two founders and ranking members of the Cali drug cartel for conspiracy to distribute more than 200,000 kilograms of cocaine.
