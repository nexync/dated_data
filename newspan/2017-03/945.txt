The late-night hosts on Monday pounced on the big viral clip from this weekend, in which a Korean studies professor’s interview on BBC was interrupted by his toddlers. Some critics thought he should have helped his wife usher the children out, but Trevor Noah took a moment to commiserate on “The Daily Show,” sharing what he said was a little-known TV custom.
It seems every time Kellyanne Conway appears on camera, the late-show writers head straight to their keyboards. She suggested on Sunday that President Barack Obama could have used a microwave oven to conduct surveillance of the Trump campaign last year. Jimmy Fallon and James Corden were ready to zap back.
If you thought for some reason that James Corden could make a good life coach, that was probably before you saw him make a smoothie — with short ribs.
Perhaps no question bedevils more New Yorkers on a semiregular basis than this: How do you pronounce “gyro”?
Jerrod Carmichael’s interview on “The Late Show” last week was one for the ages: He argued that money should buy you the right to cheat, that the word “paranoid” should be erased from the dictionary (it was the day of WikiLeaks’ latest revelations) and that “living in America is like finding out your grandmother died, while you’re” ... ahem, in a compromised position. (Just watch the clip above.) On Tuesday, he’ll speak to Mr. Corden on “The Late Late Show,” where the jokes tend to be a little softer around the edges — but it’s later in the evening, so there’s no telling what might happen.
Also, the former White House adviser Valerie Jarrett will be on “The Daily Show.” It may not be the funniest interview of the evening, but maybe she will have some idea of which tropical island Mr. Obama is hiding out on this week.
