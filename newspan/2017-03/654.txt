CHESTER, Pa. — Lynn Williams scored her second career goal and the United States women’s soccer team kicked off its 2017 slate with a 1-0 victory over Germany on Wednesday night in a matchup of the world’s top two teams.
In the 56th minute, Christen Press struck the crossbar following an individual effort and, after Tobin Heath’s follow was blocked, Williams pounced on the ball in the box to score the contest’s only goal.
