SURPRISE, Ariz. — The San Francisco Giants coach Jose Alguacil needed surgery to repair a broken nose after he was hit by a foul ball during a spring training game.
Alguacil, the Giants’ new first-base coach, who was sitting in a folding chair outside the dugout, was hit in the face Saturday and fell to the ground. He had surgery for his nose, a deep laceration and small fractures in his eye socket, the team said.
Alguacil was struck when Kansas City’s Hunter Dozier checked his swing in the eighth inning and fouled the ball back. After being assisted by trainers, Alguacil got into a cart and was driven from the field. He was holding a towel to his head, and there was blood where he fell.
The injury occurred at Surprise Stadium outside Phoenix. Alguacil was airlifted to St. Joseph’s Hospital in Phoenix.
Alguacil managed the Giants’ Class AAA affiliate in Sacramento last season.
Giants Manager Bruch Bochy was sitting next to Alguacil when the play happened.
