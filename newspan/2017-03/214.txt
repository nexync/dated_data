The topic of “Betting on Zero” might initially seem better suited to the business pages. The film chronicles the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman’s crusade against Herbalife, a nutritional-products company that sells its goods through a chain of civilian distributors.
To his critics, Mr. Ackman was a wealthy investor manipulating the market to his advantage. But he achieved partial vindication in July. In a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission after an investigation, Herbalife agreed to pay $200 million in consumer relief and restructure its practices.
Even without an upbeat ending, though, “Betting on Zero” would be persuasive advocacy. Mr. Ackman comes across as sincere in his outrage and cogent in his presentations. Even more valuable is the opportunity to meet and learn about Herbalife’s purported victims, from Queens to Chicago to Oklahoma.
Herbalife did not participate in this decidedly partisan film, although its departing chief executive, Michael O. Johnson, is among the representatives seen in footage drawn from other sources.
