The On College Basketball column on Monday about the teams selected for the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament erroneously included, in some copies, one university among the first-time tournament teams who were automatic qualifiers.

An article on Monday about Israel’s team at the World Baseball Classic misstated the result of Neal Hoffman’s appearance on the TV show “Shark Tank” to pitch the Mensch on a Bench doll that became the team’s lucky charm. While most of the show’s panel of investors passed on the doll, Hoffman did get two investors; the panelists did not all pass on the doll.
An art review on Friday about the 2017 Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art misstated the surname of a curator of the show in some editions. He is Christopher Y. Lew, not Chen.
A theater entry in the Listings pages on Friday about “Anastasia,” which is starting previews on Thursday, at the Broadhurst Theater in Manhattan, referred incompletely to that musical’s source material. It is adapted from a 1956 dramatic film and a 1997 animated feature, both titled “Anastasia”; it is not adapted from the animated film alone.
