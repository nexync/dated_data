Today is a national holiday in Hungary, honoring a 19th-century revolution.
Tied to the celebration is a poem Hungarian schoolchildren learn by heart.
The poem, Janos Arany’s “A Walesi Bardok,” or “The Bards of Wales,” was born of the uprisings that swept across Europe in 1848, known as the Springtime of the Peoples. Arany joined the fight for independence against the Austrian Empire.
Written in 1857, the poem tells the story of bards slaughtered in the 13th century, after the invasion of Wales by King Edward I of England.
The rebellious Welsh performers inspired Hungarians, who equated the tyrant king with Franz Joseph, the Austrian emperor. Decades later, the assassination of the heir apparent, Franz Ferdinand, set off World War I and the empire’s demise.
This month, Hungary celebrated the 200th anniversary of Arany’s birth. Wales, too, has taken a liking to his poem.
