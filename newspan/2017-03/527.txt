Some people love the morning, and the joy of rushing out to meet the new day, when all of life’s possibilities are out there to be grasped. And other people are sane.
The photographer Sasha Arutyunova, 28, is a nocturnal person who rarely sees the sunrise. In October 2014, she decided to force herself to engage New York City during its daybreak hours, before it applied its makeup or donned its power suit. She was going through a painful breakup at the time, and thought it would be cathartic to do something physically strenuous, and let the city intrude on her private life.
It was and it wasn’t. Leaving her Brooklyn apartment before daylight, she discovered the dog owners and off-leash dogs of Central Park, who created “a really serene space,” she said. “But Coney Island that early was kind of cold and strange. All the weirdness of Coney Island was more present and visible without people interacting with it.” She took an interest in the morning travelers: some, completely composed before leaving their homes; others trying to assemble themselves on the fly, still shaking off the effects of the night before. Often, she slogged in step with the latter tribe.
She said the work was as therapeutic as she had hoped. And now she has gone back to sleeping in.
