MIDNIGHT IN PARIS (2011) on Netflix. In Paris with his fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, Gil (Owen Wilson), a screenwriter and aspiring novelist, goes for walks nightly and is magically transported to the 1920s in this film by Woody Allen. Though Gil wakes up each day in the present, he spends his nights consorting with F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston), Salvador Dalí (Adrien Brody) and a beguiling beauty (Marion Cotillard), delighting in the glamour described as “a moveable feast” by Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). The movie, which won an Oscar for best original screenplay, “is marvelously romantic, even though — or precisely because — it acknowledges the disappointment that shadows every genuine expression of romanticism,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times.
