Paul Muldoon, who for a decade has served as the poetry editor of The New Yorker, will step down, the magazine announced on Wednesday. His successor will be Kevin Young, who moved to New York from Atlanta last year to become the director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
Mr. Young is an esteemed poet and scholar whose work has been published in The New Yorker dating back to 1999. His most recent work, “Blue Laws: Selected & Uncollected Poems 1995-2015,” made the 2016 National Book Award longlist. He will retain his position at the Schomburg Center.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning Mr. Muldoon, 65, who was raised in Ireland, had his first poem published when he was 16 and his first short collection at 19. In 1996, he was awarded an American Academy of Arts and Letters award in literature. In 2007, he replaced Alice Quinn at The New Yorker as the poetry editor, a post that she held for 20 years.
In 2013, Mr. Muldoon started a poetry podcast, saying that the “eye is not the only buyer into, and beneficiary of, the poem.” He was also well known for his interviews at the New Yorker Festival, including with Patti Smith in 2012 and Paul Simon in 2013.
Mr. Young, 46, will officially take over the post in November, after he takes part in a passing of the torch of sorts: a reading and interview with Mr. Muldoon at the New Yorker Festival in the fall.
