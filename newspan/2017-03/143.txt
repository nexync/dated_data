• The U.S. secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, is visiting Japan, South Korea and China this week at a time when conflict with North Korea is a growing concern and regional relations have been strained by his boss, President Trump.
While some global allies fear that the Trump presidency is eroding Washington’s moral authority, Mr. Tillerson’s understated approach can be seen as brilliant, mystifying or powerless.
• The White House, meanwhile, is preparing for a visit by the German leader Angela Merkel, who is seeking common ground despite sharp differences on issues like immigration, trade and, especially, Russia.
With elections looming across Europe, and Ms. Merkel seeking a fourth term, her relations with Mr. Trump and with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia are of more consequence than ever. Her long-running rivalry with Mr. Putin is a microcosm of sharply divergent visions in Europe and beyond.
• The Trump administration faced fresh criticism, this time over its abrupt order for 46 holdover U.S. attorneys to quit. The powerful Manhattan prosecutor Preet Bharara, above, who refused to resign, says he was fired.
Trump allies often blame the “deep state” — career civil servants — for negative news, but experts say it is Mr. Trump who has put his agencies under stress.

• In Fukushima, six years after the nuclear disaster, Japanese officials have still not solved a basic problem: what to do with a growing pile of radioactive waste.
The numbers are staggering: 400 tons of contaminated water per day, 3,519 containers of radioactive sludge and 3.5 billion gallons of soil.
Of the thousands who fled the area, only a few have returned, leading to ghost towns — some of which are now overrun by radioactive wild boars.
• And meet Diego, the 100-year-old giant tortoise on the Galápagos Islands whose sex drive saved his species from extinction.
From the 1970s, when barely a dozen of his kind were left, he has fathered at least 350 tortoises.
• China’s commerce minister denounced “blind and irrational investment” — the strongest signal yet that Beijing is reining in a spree of global acquisitions that reached a record $225 billion last year.
• Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull met with Elon Musk after the billionaire tech entrepreneur offered to fix South Australia’s energy shortage with a battery farm within 100 days, or the work would be free.
• Google Scholar, for academics, may be the search engine’s first service to re-enter the Chinese market, a Chinese lawmaker revealed.
• While immigration, health care and Russia are in the spotlight, our technology reporters discuss the big reversals happening in Obama-era tech policy.
• Last week we talked about morning routines. On Thursday, we’ll run through common themes and best advice from the Morning Briefing community.
Until then, you might enjoy a look at alternative morning routines. Flash mob workouts. Morning yoga sessions doubling as rave dance parties. Meditation with your morning coffee.
In North America, the start of daylight saving time on Sunday may have upended morning routines, with the loss of an hour overnight. What purpose does it serve, anyway?
• Recipe of the day: Irish tacos — pile shredded corned beef onto a tortilla with slaw.
• Flecks of space dust, or micrometeorites, are everywhere — on buildings, sidewalks and park benches. That’s the conclusion of an international team led by a Norwegian musician, a gifted amateur.
• The Jewish holiday of Purim began Saturday night, and Hindus are celebrating the spring festival, Holi. The centennial of Russia’s revolution, however, will go unmentioned by Moscow.
• Finally, meet Bilal Abdul Kareem, a former comedian from New York who has built a reputation as a unique voice covering the war in Syria.
Golf has long been a favorite pastime of world leaders, including U.S. presidents.
Counting Mr. Trump, 16 of the last 19 have been golfers.
Many others in government service around the world have achieved success in sports. A few notables: the former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley, a hall-of-fame basketball player; the champion boxer Manny Pacquiao, now a politician in the Philippines; and Imran Khan, the Pakistani cricket star who became a leading Parliamentarian.
Many women, too, led a sporting life before entering the political arena.
The Australian Nova Peris is one of the most accomplished. Twice an Olympian, she competed as a sprinter and in field hockey. In 1996, she became the first indigenous Australian to win Olympic gold.
Ms. Peris was then elected to Australia’s Parliament, another first. Upon resigning last year, she credited athletics with preparing her for politics.
It’s a theme others echo. Playing sports “took the fear out of losing,” Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a college squash and tennis player, told The Times.
