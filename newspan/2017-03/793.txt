St. Patrick’s Day will soon be upon us, and Team Trump would like you to know that for just $50 you can purchase a green “Make America Great Again” hat embroidered with a symbol that has nothing to do with St. Patrick’s Day.
The hats went on sale last week in advance of the holiday, celebrated on March 17, and had a four-leaf clover — instead of a three-leaf shamrock — stitched on the back. A four-leaf clover is not a symbol of Ireland. It is just a plant.
On Wednesday afternoon the hats disappeared from Mr. Trump’s online store. A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not respond to questions about why the hats were taken off the website.
Mixing up the number of leaves on a shamrock is an easy mistake to make, especially in the United States, where St. Patrick’s Day is widely celebrated even by people with no substantive connection to Ireland.
The Obama campaign made the same mistake in 2012, producing a line of Irish-themed campaign swag covered in four-leaf clovers (it soon reversed course.) Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, himself an Irish-American, used a four-leaf clover on Twitter last year. Even the Irish beer company Guinness is not immune: It used a four-leaf clover in a series of advertisements in Canada last year.
“Patty” is not the nickname used for a man named Patrick. It is the nickname used for a woman named “Patricia.” Men named Patrick — including the saint honored on March 17 — are referred to casually as “Paddy.” Like many Americans, the Republican Party made that mistake, too, in its advertisement for the Trump hat.
Mr. O’Dowd said he thought that misspelling was a forgivable offense.
