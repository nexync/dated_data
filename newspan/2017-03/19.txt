Semilla, a chef’s counter opened by José Ramírez-Ruiz and Pamela Yung in 2014 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, will serve its final dinners on Saturday. Cooks at the small restaurant, acclaimed for its tasting menu of mainly vegetable and grain dishes, will bake whole roasted sunchokes into sourdough bread, and serve Carolina Gold rice with parsnips and black truffles.
Ms. Yung, a pastry chef whose breads and desserts helped to build the restaurant’s fan base, left the kitchen last October, though news of the restaurant’s sudden closing still came as a surprise on Thursday, when Mr. Ramírez-Ruiz posted a farewell message on Instagram.
“Semilla has been a dream come true, and we want to thank everyone who helped make it possible,” the chef wrote.
In a phone interview on Friday, he praised his small team, comprising just two cooks and two front-of-the-house employees. He said he had been thinking about leaving Semilla for a while, but had no immediate plans for the future.
Ms. Yung said Friday that she had left the restaurant “to get some distance, keep my hands busy, explore long-held interests and see the world a bit.” She added that she was currently exploring new potential partnerships.
Reviewing Semilla for The New York Times in 2015, Pete Wells awarded the restaurant two stars, praising its offbeat, vegetable-focused approach — which used small amounts of fish and meat — and its relatively affordable tasting menu.
Later that year, the restaurant received a Michelin star.
