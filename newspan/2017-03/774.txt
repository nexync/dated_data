How Much Is Your House Worth Per Minute?
Suburban home buyers can get a lot more house for the money compared with city dwellers. Sales prices tell us how much money people spend for their space, and train schedules tell us how much time. Together they give us a sense of what a suburban home is worth in a cost-per-minute figure.
Last year, using data compiled by the appraisal company Miller Samuel, we analyzed home values and commute times along a stretch of the Metro-North Railroad’s New Haven line, into Connecticut. Now we’ve looked at Metro-North’s Harlem line, again dividing the dollar amount of a median-price home near each station by the time it took to get there from Grand Central Terminal, to arrive at the cost-per-minute figure. Our first stop in the suburbs this time is Bronxville.
Unlike our New Haven line analysis, no particular sweet spot along the line could be isolated. And differences in home values could not be correlated to the location and convenience of an express stop. Rather, cost per minute proved consistent along each of four sections of the route, stepping down along the way.
Commuters pay $36,826 per minute for the tony suburb of Scarsdale, which, along with Bronxville, brought up the cost per minute along the first section of the line to an average of $25,004. Next, between Hartsdale and Chappaqua, the average cost was $13,309 per minute.
From Mount Kisco, 61 minutes into the ride, to Croton Falls, the average was $8,912 per commuting minute, with very little variation among the stations. Finally, after a train ride of 85 minutes you come to Brewster, a distinct break point. From there through Tenmile River, the cost per minute dropped to an average of $2,394.
As in Connecticut, after about an hour and a half on the train, commuting farther doesn’t seem worth it.
