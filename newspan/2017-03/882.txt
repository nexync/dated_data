A slew of technology regulations were enacted under President Barack Obama, including online privacy protections and the classification of broadband as a utility-like service.
Under President Trump, the rollback of those regulations is gaining momentum.
This week, Congress completed its overturning of rules that would have made it more difficult for broadband providers to collect data on people’s browsing habits and software use. And on Thursday, Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, made it clear that another shoe might soon drop. Mr. Spicer took aim at net neutrality rules that are designed to ensure equal access to content on the internet, writes Steve Lohr, a technology reporter for The New York Times.
Net neutrality laws were passed in 2015. The rules are intended to ensure that there are no pay-for-play lanes that only wealthy technology and media companies can afford to pay for, with everyone else having to use slower lanes. Any rollback of net neutrality would be a victory for companies like AT&T and Comcast, which have argued that the rules impede investments in new networks and jobs.
