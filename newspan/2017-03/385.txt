U.S. Soccer revealed a new policy Saturday that will require anyone on a national team to “stand respectfully” during national anthems. The penalties for a failure to follow the policy were unclear.
An image of the written bylaw, which was passed by the soccer federation’s board of directors on Feb. 9, was posted on Twitter by Stuart Holden, a former national team player and an analyst for Fox Soccer. Holden attended the federation’s annual general meeting in Hawaii, where the policy was unveiled.
Neil Buethe, director of communications for U.S. Soccer, confirmed in an email that the policy had been approved.
Holden also said on Twitter that Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, had said that the penalties for violating the policy would be determined case by case.
The new policy came after Megan Rapinoe, a member of the national team and of the Seattle Reign in the National Women’s Soccer League, knelt during the anthem at least twice last year: first before a Reign match and then with the national team before a friendly against Thailand. Rapinoe’s gesture followed the example of Colin Kaepernick, the N.F.L. quarterback who said he was protesting injustices against minorities.
