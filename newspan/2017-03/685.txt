“The Circus,” Showtime’s documentary series that captured the 2016 election in real time, returns to cover the early days of the Trump administration. And Woody Allen’s nostalgic film “Radio Days” is on Hulu.
THE CIRCUS 8 p.m. on Showtime. The first season of this newsy documentary series, presented by Mark McKinnon and the “Game Change” authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, provided real-time glimpses inside the wild 2016 election. Season 2 will focus on the early days of the Trump administration and the stories behind the daily barrage of newspaper headlines and tweets.
BIG LITTLE LIES 9 p.m. on HBO. David E. Kelley’s mini-series, gorgeously directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, continues with its fifth of seven installments. Among this week’s drama: Madeline receives encouraging but still worrisome news about the play, while Dr. Reisman tries to understand Celeste’s relationship with Perry. Then on “Girls,” at 10, Hannah gets some advice from her dad about a big life decision (no spoilers here). At 10:30, Pete Holmes’s comedy “Crashing,” presented in part by Judd Apatow, returns with Pete’s parents coming to New York. He begs Jess to tag along to pretend they are still married. But a tense dinner puts the charade to a test. Stick around at 11 for the latest episode of “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver.” All these are also streaming on HBO Go and HBO Now.
