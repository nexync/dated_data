WARSAW — Nearly a dozen people in their 20s gathered beside the entrance to the Auschwitz memorial on Friday afternoon, slaughtered a sheep, stripped naked and chained themselves together. A fireworks device was set off in the nearby parking lot.
On Friday evening, the authorities were still trying to figure out who the people are and what they thought they were doing.
One local media report said the people had filmed themselves with a drone. Other reports said they were protesting the conflict in eastern Ukraine, though what their staged demonstration had to do with that was unexplained.
Officials at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum — on the sites of the two camps where more than one million people died during World War II — said they had been caught off guard and had no idea what was intended.
