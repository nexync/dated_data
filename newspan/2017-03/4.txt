Time-travel shows are certainly having a moment, but “Making History” puts a comedic spin on the idea. Adam Pally stars as a salty schlub who has discovered a big, ratty gym bag that’s actually a time machine. He’s been traveling back to the 1770s and has fallen in love with Paul Revere’s daughter (Leighton Meester), and now he’s enlisting a history professor to help him preserve historical events so as not to alter the present too much.
Kurt Braunohler’s new stand-up special is loopy, sometimes lewd, and fun — juvenile in spots, but it covers so much ground that you can’t stay mad for long. Don’t like the part about Hitler’s dog? Why, here’s a section about a babysitter who knows all the curse words. Braunohler has an energetic but controlled style, and this is a tightly packed hour, culminating in a gleefully hilarious closing segment about beavers.
This isn’t one of those “yell until the kids barf and the parents cry” shows, thank God. It’s a warm, encouraging documentary, airing in three half-hour segments, about a basketball team of talented, dedicated 11- and 12-year-old girls. The W.N.B.A. player Skylar Diggins sponsors and mentors their team, the Sky Digg Ballers, and her stepfather, Maurice Scott, is the coach.
This is the rare youth sports show in which the coaching is inspiring, not threatening and abusive as on “Dance Moms” or “Friday Night Tykes.” Scott’s mantra is, “Don’t get mad, get better,” and the girls’ determination reflects that work ethic and general positivity.
