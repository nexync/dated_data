But it might not have.
In the mid-1930s, at the height of the Depression, unemployment was soaring at 25 percent. President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Work Projects Administration to put Americans back to work.
Artists, who often didn’t have regular jobs in the first place, weren’t certain to be included. But Harry Hopkins, who directed the W.P.A., decided they should be.
So the Federal Art Project of the W.P.A. was created. Over nine years, it spawned more than 100,000 paintings and murals and nearly 20,000 sculptures.
Some of the artists employed by the program went on to become famous, including Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning.
