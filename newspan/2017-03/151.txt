WASHINGTON — One of the few senior Obama administration appointees still at the State Department delivered a ringing endorsement on Thursday of Mexico’s efforts to stop illegal drugs from entering the United States, just as the Trump administration is examining whether to slash money supporting those efforts.
William R. Brownfield, assistant secretary for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, said in a conference call with reporters that the United Nations and decades of patient diplomacy had put the United States in a much better position to police the international flow of narcotics than at any point in the last three decades.
The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic that is now killing more people than traffic accidents, and at least 90 percent of the heroin consumed in this country comes from Mexico.
Mr. Brownfield said the opioid crisis had been caused by, among other factors, doctors’ prescribing habits and soaring patient demand in the United States and by Mexican drug traffickers’ increased efforts to meet that demand.
Mr. Brownfield said that Mexico and the United Nations were vital allies in the fight against international drug trafficking. The Merida Initiative, a bilateral partnership with Mexico begun in 2007 that is focused on fighting organized criminal groups, “makes us more able to interdict drug trafficking than ever before,” he said.
The Trump administration is compiling a list of continuing American aid to Mexico, possibly in hopes of identifying money that could be diverted to help pay for a border wall. The Merida Initiative is the review’s biggest target.
The Trump administration continues to rely on Obama appointees like Mr. Brownfield because of a slow appointments process.
