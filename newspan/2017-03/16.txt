Mr. Kislyak also met with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, in December.

• Syrian government forces again drove Islamic State militants out of Palmyra, the ancient city that was among the leading tourist attractions in prewar Syria.
The Islamic State had used the city as a propaganda windfall, making a sport of pilfering and vandalizing prized antiquities it considered heretical and using the Roman theater for public beheadings.

Iceland endured a mock constitutional crisis last week after the president, Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson, jokingly told a class of high school students that he would like to ban pineapple pizza toppings.
Unlike Mr. Johannesson, Saparmurat Niyazov, the Turkmenistan president who died in 2006, stood out as a head of state who used his office to impose his personal preferences on citizens.
He renamed January after himself. April was renamed after his mother.
Mr. Niyazov also banned circuses and video games. And he had a golden rotating statue of himself installed in Ashgabat, the capital.
His successor, Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, relocated the statue and ordered his own built. Last month, he was re-elected, winning 98 percent of the vote.
