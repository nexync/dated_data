In your March 14 editorial about the Congressional Budget Office’s score of the American Health Care Act, you wrote: “The numbers are the numbers. The C.B.O. has called it as it sees it, and the picture is clear.” As I’ve said, I strenuously disagree, and so did your editorial board.
This week’s C.B.O. assessment, which you praise, finds that with almost no changes in subsidies or Medicaid, 14 million Americans will drop their insurance next year. That is worse than guesswork; it is simply unbelievable.
The Budget Office scored a Republican bill that is just one part of President Trump’s plan to provide affordable, quality health care to every American. It is a great disservice to your readers to ascribe such certainty to the Budget Office’s numbers, and to offer no mention of the other reforms in progress.
President Trump and our team at Health and Human Services are working every day to carry out health care reform that is truly affordable and puts patients first — in other words, a completely different system from the failing health care law we have now.
