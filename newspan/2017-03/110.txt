ORLANDO, Fla. — Courtney Lee scored 20 points, Lance Thomas added 17 and the Knicks put together a big fourth quarter and rallied past the Orlando Magic, 113-105, on Monday night.
Willy Hernangomez had 14 points and 8 rebounds, while Kristaps Porzingis scored 14 points for the Knicks, who had lost two straight. Kyle O’Quinn sparked the comeback with 11 points and 8 rebounds, all in the fourth quarter.
Making do without Carmelo Anthony, who missed the game with a sore knee, the Knicks outscored Orlando by 28-13 in the fourth period, holding the Magic to just 17.6 percent shooting (3 of 17), while shooting 54.5 percent (12 of 22).
The Knicks scored 10 straight points to start the fourth quarter and eventually pushed that to a 23-4 run that turned a 7-point deficit into a 108-96 lead with 4 minutes 38 seconds left.
O’Quinn, who played just 20 seconds in the first three periods, sparked the late run. O’Quinn, a former Orlando forward, hit all five shots from the field and grabbed four rebounds during the run as the Knicks suddenly came alive at both ends of the floor.
The Knicks, who missed their first six shots and trailed by 11-0 to start the game, limited Orlando to 1-of-8 shooting and four turnovers in the first seven minutes of the final period.
With Anthony unavailable, the Magic went right at his replacement, the backup point guard Ron Baker, on virtually every possession. Evan Fournier scored 11 points on him in the first six minutes, before the Knicks moved away from their attempt at a small-ball lineup. The Knicks had started with a three-guard lineup of Derrick Rose, Baker and Lee.
Anthony, who has averaged 26.2 points and 7.1 rebounds in his career against the Magic, is expected to play Wednesday in Milwaukee.
Elfrid Payton had his first triple-double of the season, with 16 points, 10 assists and 11 rebounds. Fournier led Orlando with 25 points, and Aaron Gordon had 17 in the Magic’s third loss in four games.
