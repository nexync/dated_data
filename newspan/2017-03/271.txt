“Dancing With the Stars” returns for its 24th season on ABC with contestants including Nick Viall, fresh off “The Bachelor.” And the vampire comedy “What We Do in the Shadows” is streaming on Amazon.
BABY MAMA (2008) 8 p.m. on HBO. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler starred in this comedy about a 37-year-old single woman (Ms. Fey) who hires a silly, slap-happy surrogate (Ms. Poehler) to help her have the child she desperately wants. “The film never comes fully to term, as it were: the visual style is sitcom functional, and even the zippiest jokes fall flat because of poor timing,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times. “But, much like the prickly, talented Ms. Fey, it pulls you in with a provocative and, at least in current American movies, unusual mix of female intelligence, awkwardness and chilled-to-the-bone mean.” Also streaming on HBO Go and HBO Now.
HUMANS 10 p.m. on AMC. The brief, seven-episode second season of this sci-fi series ends as Mattie reveals the synths’ agenda and tries to enlist Max for help. Meanwhile, Mia and Hester break into the silo while Karen makes a major decision.
