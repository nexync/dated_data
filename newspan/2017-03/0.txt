Answers to all of your questions and more are below, as we’ve rounded up the best of our advice for filing your taxes.
• How to Fill Out Your Tax Return Like a Pro: The basics to get you started. In this step-by-step guide, our reporter prepared a return for a hypothetical suburban New York couple, in consultation with a vice president from TurboTax.

• Which Online Tax-Prep Service Should You Use? If you’re going the online route, have you decided which service to use?
• Navigating the Many Offers of Free Tax Help: The Internal Revenue Service and commercial vendors provide free tax software, but the offerings often carry income restrictions, and features vary.
• Tips for Whittling Down Your Tax Bill: You’re legally obligated to pay only what you owe and nothing more, so these tips from the pros might help to pare back your bill.
Here’s one you might not have thought about: Do-overs are possible. If you realize after filing that you didn’t take a deduction you were qualified for, it’s possible to amend your return up to three years after its original due date.
• Health Savings Accounts: Don’t Leave Money on the Table: Another little-known but perfectly legal tactic: Eligible filers can make a tax-deductible contribution to a health savings account for the 2016 tax year up until the federal filing deadline.
• I.R.S. Extension Adds Time to File, but You Still Have to Pay: Really, it’s no big deal. Though you should try to hit the April 18 deadline, requesting an extension can help prevent you from making careless errors in a rush to file in time. You’d also avoid a penalty for missing the cutoff, which is around 5 percent per month of any tax owed, up to 25 percent.
However: Though an extension will give you more time to file your return, if you owe any tax, it’s still due April 18. “It’s an extension of time to file, not to pay,” one expert told our reporter.
• Ways to Save (and Not Spend) Your Tax Refund: More than 70 percent of taxpayers are likely to get a refund this year. If you’re among them, what should you do?
While splurging on a special gift for yourself or your family is the most instantly gratifying move, considering buying savings bonds or splitting up your return among multiple bank accounts. Nearly half of American families would struggle to meet an emergency expense of even $400, according to the Federal Reserve. Think about using your refund as protection against that.
