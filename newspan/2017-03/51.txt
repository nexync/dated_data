Re “A Lifeline for Troubled Veterans” (editorial, March 12): The announcement by the Department of Veterans Affairs of support for veterans who got less than honorable discharges is an important step in our national responsibility.
I am a Vietnam veteran, honorably discharged; the journey of my personal return has taken 50 years. My first venture into a V.A. facility for care did not happen until three years ago. This was 47 years after I was discharged. I hadn’t been ready to receive care.
These veterans need our support to help them live more normal lives. After service and combat, normal isn’t an easy state of mind to find. We sent them to war; we are responsible for caring for them once they come home.
