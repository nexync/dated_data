“Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping,” a feature-length fake documentary that sends up everyone from Justin Bieber to Justin Timberlake, does not so much break ground as provide welcome fan service. (Mr. Timberlake has a small role as the main character’s personal chef.) The Lonely Island may be best in small doses, but there is just about enough goofiness here to fill an hour and a half. The performances and videos are the best part, of course — inspired and inventive beats and ballads that have sufficient musical integrity to make them credible jokes. And the film’s structure, which evokes the shiny, breathless vacuity of “all-access” promotional documentaries like “Katy Perry: Part of Me,” does not crowd the riffing and noodling with too much plot or sentiment.
... Their testimony represents the movie’s slyest joke and its most revealing fantasy. Nearly all these musicians — they include Questlove, RZA, Usher, Nas — are black, and members of the unimpeachable hip-hop and R&B royalty that young white men like Conner, Owen and Lawrence (which is also to say the guys who play them) would grow up idolizing. “Popstar” reverses the idolatry, which is hilarious on its face and also a gesture in the direction of some of the cultural taboos and conundrums that stretch back through the history of American popular music from Eminem to Elvis Presley to the arrival of the banjo.
