Truth is, no one can really replace Beyoncé. But at Coachella this year, Lady Gaga will take her spot.
The festival announced late Tuesday that Lady Gaga would perform instead of Beyoncé on the second night of its three-day event in Indio, Calif., over two successive weekends, April 14-16 and 21-23 — giving Lady Gaga a headlining spot at the biggest and most influential American music festival just two months after she performed for 117.5 million viewers at the Super Bowl halftime show. This year’s festival will also be headlined by Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar.
A number of major acts had been rumored as possible replacements for Beyoncé, including Rihanna, Chance the Rapper, Daft Punk and even Jay Z, her husband. But the selection of Lady Gaga preserves at least one aspect of Beyoncé’s booking: a major female pop star known for playing to the crowds with a big, choreographed production, something entirely new to the Coachella stage.
