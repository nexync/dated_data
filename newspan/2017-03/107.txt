Which Photograph Stays In Your Memory?
Of the millions of photographs or images you have viewed in your lifetime, are there any that stand out? Is there just one that pops into your mind? Why?
What is it that makes a photograph memorable?
But words have their place, too, and what goes without saying often needs to be primed with speech. The images that associatively come to my mind when I look at “The Cotton Pickers” are highly personal, but they remain opaque until I name them. The pattern of the cotton field in Lyon’s photograph reminds me of something the great art critic John Berger once wrote: that when we look at a star-filled night sky, we are able to tell stories about it only by organizing the stars into constellations. A strong photograph like “The Cotton Pickers” is like a star on a clear night. We can track it better when we locate it in relation to other stars.
