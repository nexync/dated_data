Bryan Doerries, the artistic director of the Brooklyn-based group Theater of War Productions, has taken community-based performances based on ancient Greek tragedy and other classic texts to more than 600 military bases, prisons, hospitals and other venues around the world, where he has used them to spur conversations about violence, trauma and survival.
But in the next two years, Mr. Doerries will be sticking to a stage closer to home: the entire city of New York.
The city’s Department of Veterans Services and Department of Cultural Affairs has announced that Mr. Doerries is its newest public artist in residence. During his tenure, Theater of War will stage more than 60 free events in venues in all five boroughs, drawing on its repertory while developing new productions tailored to different communities.
Theater of War, founded in 2009, is based on the idea that Greek tragedy is “an ancient technology,” as Mr. Doerries likes to put it, that when plugged into the right audience can provoke an intense, cathartic response. Mr. Doerries also has help from a deep roster of prominent actors, who both bring in curious crowds and break through their defenses with no-holds-barred intensity of delivery.
The first presentation of Mr. Doerries’s residency will be a reading of Sophocles’ “Ajax” and “Philoctetes” on March 20 at the Greene Space in Manhattan, featuring Mr. Giamatti, Frances McDormand, David Strathairn and Reg E. Cathey. That will be followed by a performance at the Crown Heights branch of the Brooklyn Public Library on April 6 and a bilingual presentation at the Pregones and Puerto Rican Traveling Theater in the Bronx on May 6.
