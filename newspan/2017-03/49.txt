On Thursday “Game of Thrones” fans learned the information they have awaited for months: Season 7 of the show will arrive on July 16. But first they had to spend over an hour watching ice melt.
In a memorably misguided marketing gimmick, HBO revealed the premiere date in a Facebook Live video but made fans work for it, concealing the information in a block of ice and asking viewers to comment “Fire” as a torch heated it.
Fans watched ice melt for more than 15 minutes, with “Game of Thrones” stars like Isaac Hempstead Wright and Lena Headey occasionally appearing in the video to urge them to comment. Then the video stopped working.
The announcement of the Season 7 premiere date is bittersweet for fans, who are eager for the show’s return but aware that it will be the beginning of the end. The creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have confirmed that there will only be 13 more episodes of the show, split over two abbreviated seasons — seven this year, six in 2018. The first six seasons had 10 episodes each.
