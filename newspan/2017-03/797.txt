The three convicts fashioned papier-mâché dummies of themselves, topped with hair from the prison barbershop, and used a tunnel they’d carved with a metal spoon to plunge into frigid waters, never to be seen again.
The prison break in 1962, one of the world’s most famous, occurred at Alcatraz, in San Francisco Bay. The federal penitentiary, known as “The Rock,” closed on this day the following year.
La Isla de los Alcatraces, or Island of the Pelicans, was named by a Spanish explorer in 1775. The U.S. military constructed a prison and the first operational lighthouse on the West Coast when it acquired the land in the 1850s.
The three escapees are presumed to have drowned, although no remains were found. A 1979 film starring Clint Eastwood told their story, cementing Alcatraz as a cultural reference point. Of the total 41 inmates who tried to escape, none is known to have succeeded.
The penitentiary, which went operational in 1934, remains open for tours.
And the Escape From Alcatraz triathlon, first held in 1981, draws more than 2,000 athletes every year — perhaps proving that with proper training (and wet suits), it is possible to make it the 1.5 miles to land alive.
