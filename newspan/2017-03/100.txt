• F.B.I. is investigating Russia ties.
Mr. Comey also said that he had no information supporting Mr. Trump’s claim that he was wiretapped on the orders of President Barack Obama. The unsubstantiated assertion has renewed a debate about whether security agencies invade Americans’ privacy.
Overlapping inquiries by the House, the Senate and the F.B.I. have been plagued by partisan sniping.
• Gorsuch gets his moment.
Judge Neil M. Gorsuch is set to make his first lengthy public remarks since Mr. Trump nominated him for the Supreme Court.

• The Pentagon’s rising power.
The president is shifting more authority over operations to military commanders, according to White House officials, reversing what aides and some generals say was a tendency under Mr. Obama to micromanage.
But Mr. Trump has so far maintained his predecessor’s strategy of trying to minimize the American military’s footprint overseas.
The government said today that it intended to formally notify the European Union of its intention to leave the bloc on March 29, putting the country on track to complete a withdrawal by early 2019.

In the war on drugs, few tactics have proved as dangerous as the use of forcible-entry raids to serve search warrants. Our investigation found that the interventions had led to avoidable deaths, gruesome injuries and costly settlements.
We also look at whether it’s murder or self-defense when an officer is killed in a raid.

For International Women’s Day this month, we looked at countries with the highest percentage of women in Parliament.
Today, we’re answering a reader’s follow-up question: What is it like on the other side of the equation, for women who hold just a few seats in national legislatures?
In India, roughly 12 percent of the 545-member Lok Sabha, or lower house of Parliament, are women. Supriya Sule, who is serving her second term, acknowledged that women sometimes received comments about their appearance from colleagues that men would not. She said she tried to ignore them.
Ms. Sule said she hoped Prime Minister Narendra Modi would push for a long-stalled bill to ensure one-third of the seats in the Lok Sabha and in state assemblies were filled by women.
“We must have equal representation,” she said.
