• Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia’s prime minister, is widely expected to win the first round of presidential elections on Sunday.
Media coverage has been heavily tilted in favor of Mr. Vucic, who was once Slobodan Milosevic’s chief propagandist. Reporters say that intimidation tactics have made it almost impossible to do fair-minded journalism.

There’s no checklist to guarantee anybody will become a C.E.O., but it certainly helps to have a lot of stamina, and not need much sleep so you can get a jump on the day. It’s been a consistent theme. Examples that stand out are Bob Iger of Disney and Wendy Kopp of Teach for America and their (very early) morning routines. Pro tip: Make sure you start with a plan for the day, so you’re not just being reactive to the inevitable flood of emails.
• “It is a kind of meditation in a way.” In Norway, women are increasingly taking up hunting, a bastion of macho male culture, as a way to connect with nature and the food chain.

• We caught up with outstanding Parisian artisans: a former stockbroker who makes custom-tailored bicycles and ceramists making beautiful dishes for some of the French capital’s chicest restaurants.
Join the club. Celebrate World Backup Day today.
The event was started in 2011 by companies selling data backup products or services, set the day before April Fools’ Day. The motto, “Don’t Be an April Fool,” may be working.
One company, Backblaze, says its annual surveys show that the number of computer users who never back up their data has been shrinking, dropping to just 25 percent by 2015.
Still, data loss miseries abound. The animation studio Pixar suffered when 90 percent of “Toy Story 2” was accidentally deleted before its release in the U.S. in 1999.
Though Pixar was able to recover its files through painstaking work, not all data losses end happily.
The creators of a children’s show called “Zodiac Island” sued their internet service provider and one of its former employees after he “went on a data-wiping rampage” in 2009.
Perhaps because World Backup Day had not yet been instituted, the files had not been backed up.
