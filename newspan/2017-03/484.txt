It was disappointing that in an otherwise fine obituary of the poet Derek Walcott, you dismiss serious acts of sexual harassment that he engaged in (“Derek Walcott, 1930-2017: Caribbean’s Lyrical Voice and Nobel Laureate,” front page, March 18).
In fact, Harvard’s own account of what happened is entirely different.
The university reprimanded Mr. Walcott for his conduct, and the case led Harvard to adopt its first formal sexual harassment policy.
The Times has previously reported many of these facts.
This was not a victimless offense. As the reporter who covered the story for the student newspaper, I saw firsthand the anguish and disruption that Mr. Walcott’s actions caused to a young woman who had come to Harvard to study poetry and did not expect to be preyed upon in this way. Mr. Walcott would later be accused of similar actions by a student at Boston University.
Today, we take for granted that professors, and employers, cannot act as Mr. Walcott did and that if they do, there will be serious consequences. We owe these standards of conduct to brave women and men like the Harvard freshman, who insisted — at a time when it was far from agreed upon — that sexual harassment is wrong.
You do a disservice to these courageous victims, and to history, when you overlook the factual record — which you yourself have previously confirmed — and dismiss offenses like Mr. Walcott’s.
