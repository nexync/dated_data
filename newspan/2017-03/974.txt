Q. I live in a rent-stabilized building in Chelsea, Manhattan, next to a woman who gives loud parties. She and her guests yell, bang on walls and slam doors until 5 a.m. The police will not intervene because she will not open the door for them. After I complained, she retaliated by banging on my door, which I considered harassment. Many tenants, and the live-in super, have complained to her and notified the landlord, who said there is nothing he can do. Is this true? What legal standing do we have?
Your landlord should intervene. He could bring a nuisance eviction proceeding against the tenant, serving her with a notice that details the offensive behavior. When the notice expires, the landlord could bring her to court, where a judge would try to get her to agree to stop creating the disturbance, or face eviction. If she complies, she could stay. If not, she could lose her apartment.
But your landlord has been unwilling to act. So how do you force his hand?
You could withhold rent, arguing that your neighbor’s actions violate the warranty of habitability, a state statute. But the landlord could take you to court for nonpayment of rent, which would make your life worse and would not solve the problem.
You could sue your landlord for harassment in Housing Court. “In effect, you’d be saying that the landlord’s failure to do anything would be harassment,” Mr. Himmelstein said. Or you could bring a private nuisance suit against the landlord and the tenant in State Supreme Court. You might not win, and you would definitely lose time and money.
