Drug-resistant germs, including Candida auris, prey on severely ill patients in skilled nursing facilities, a problem sometimes amplified by poor care and low staffing.
Ms. Davilaâ€™s medical records, reviewed by The Times, do not identify the specific date when she got C. auris. But a chart written by a Palm Gardens doctor in December 2018 includes a note listing her as a carrier of the fungus. She was put in isolation for C. auris patients, and her records subsequently referred to her as having the infection and taking antifungal medications for it.
