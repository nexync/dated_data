This film, adapted from Roman Gary’s fictionalized memoir, looks great but misses greatness.
A sprawling, well-appointed epic directed by Eric Barbier, “Promise at Dawn” both exudes and critiques self-regard. The charitable view is that Romain Gary, the author of the book it is based on, led a life extraordinary enough to warrant the grandiosity. Beyond his literary accomplishments, he was a World War II aviator, a diplomat, a filmmaker and the husband of Jean Seberg.
The book has been taken as a fictionalized memoir in which the less-than-trustworthy Gary credits his success to his determined mother, Nina (played by Charlotte Gainsbourg, speaking French and Polish). Through toughness and clever bluffing, she removes him from the drabness and anti-Semitism of Vilna to a life of comfort in Nice, always, always reminding him that his mission is to become a great writer.
Stylistically, “Promise at Dawn” plays as if it’s been processed through a prestige-ifier: The sweeping camera movements and Max Richter music push all the right emotional buttons. The movie looks and sounds great, but greatness and depth elude it.
