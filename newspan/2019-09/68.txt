Mark your calendar. From a revamped MoMA and the fearless Pope.L to Renaissance sculptors and female modernists, here are more than 100 shows that define the new season.
It’s a season of debuts for artists — from Renaissance masters never before seen in New York to jazz pianists with breakout museum shows — and also for real estate.

You’ll find these highlights, and more than 100 others, below, including watercolors, pastels, immigrant stories, fairs and a full year of women-centered art shows in Baltimore.
