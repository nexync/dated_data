“Taco Tuesday” got bad news on Wednesday.
A spokesman for Mr. James said Wednesday night that his lawyers were still looking over the patent office’s findings. Still, he cast the decision in a positive light.
He said that in refusing to trademark the phrase because it was common, the office had essentially offered what Mr. James wanted all along: protection from liability if he used “Taco Tuesday” in certain projects, like podcasts and other media.
Mr. James often uses the phrase on Instagram to let people know it is his family’s taco night.
Soon, it became national news, with many questioning whether anyone should hold a trademark for a phrase so widely used.
In fact, a restaurant in Cheyenne, Wyo., does already hold a trademark for “Taco Tuesday.” The restaurant has aggressively protected its intellectual property, The Los Angeles Times reported.
Mr. James’s attempt to claim the term was seen as a possible means to “free” it for use by all.
Josh Gerben, a lawyer specializing in trademarks, said if Mr. James really did want to shield himself from liability, he could file something called a “petition to cancel” that could essentially void another trademark.
