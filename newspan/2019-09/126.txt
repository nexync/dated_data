Oracle, the computer technology company, intends to create and fund a large circuit of lower-tier professional tournaments in the United States.
Noah Rubin, an American player ranked No. 195, has explored the challenges of succeeding in professional tennis in his series, “Behind the Racquet” on Instagram. He said he thought the new Oracle circuit could be beneficial.
Rubin said the game might be better served by improving conditions, promotion and prize money at existing events.
“Quality over quantity,” he said. “There is a benefit to having quantity as well, I understand that, but at the same time I’m playing a lot of these tournaments, and it doesn’t feel we are getting the respect we deserve."
