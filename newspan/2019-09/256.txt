This movie often feels like it’s being faked out by its own story line. “Strange but True,” directed by Rowan Athale, from an Eric Garcia script adapted from John Searles’s novel, opens with Philip, hobbling through the woods on one crutch, clearly trying to get away from danger. After he takes a bad fall, the movie flashes back two days.
The young man, played by Nick Robinson, is now couchbound in a suburban house, sniping with his perpetually angry mom, Charlene (Amy Ryan). They are visited by the angelic Melissa (Margaret Qualley), who was with Charlene’s other son, Ronnie, when he died in an accident five years earlier. Melissa, now pregnant, believes that the child she’s carrying is that of her long-dead boyfriend.
Melissa optimistically toddles back to the home rented to her by a generous older couple (Blythe Danner and Brian Cox). And Charlene goes ballistic, lashing out at her ex-husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear), who returns from his new life to try to help figure out what’s going on.
Much of the next portion of the picture plays like a therapy-resistant “Ordinary People,” while the opening scene continues nagging the viewer that a thriller component is on its way. Athale also uses techniques like slow-motion and parallel editing to build dread. At a crucial juncture he chooses to play a story point for shock above suspense, which winds up feeling a little cheap.
For all that, the tale is a jolting one, and the superb players do justice to the emotional distress of its characters. But a surer directorial hand might have yielded a more resonant experience.
Rated PG-13 for themes, violence, language. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes.
