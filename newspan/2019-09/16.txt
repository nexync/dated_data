Also, she’s taking your questions.
From crafting infectious dance pop to managing an envious big-screen career to serving as an “American Idol” host for awhile, Jennifer Lopez has spent more than two decades entertaining us. Now there’s a new addition to her résumé, a flashy role in the drama “Hustlers,” about former strippers who devise a new way to drain cash from their clients.
Lopez (or J. Lo if you please) is attending the Toronto International Film Festival, where “Hustlers” will have its world premiere ahead of its Sept. 13 theatrical release.
