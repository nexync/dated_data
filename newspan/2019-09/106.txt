You Know Emily Doe’s Story. Now Learn Her Name.
In 2016, Ms. Miller’s case made headlines after BuzzFeed published the statement she read at the sentencing hearing for Brock Turner, the Stanford student convicted of the assault.
Mr. Turner, then 20, was found guilty of three counts of felony sexual assault, for which the maximum sentence was 14 years. But the presiding judge, Aaron Persky, sentenced Mr. Turner to six months in county jail, of which he served three. Judge Persky’s ruling drew criticism from those who viewed it as too lenient, and he was recalled by voters in 2018.
Although Ms. Miller’s case preceded the #MeToo movement, her statement and Mr. Turner’s sentence became part of the intense debates around rape, sexism and sexual misconduct over the past years. In addition to the judge’s recall, the first time California voters took such an action in more than 80 years, Gov. Jerry Brown signed a bill imposing mandatory minimum sentences in sexual assault cases. Ms. Miller’s statement was read aloud on CNN and on the floor of the House of Representatives.
