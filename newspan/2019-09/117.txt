The company and its owners, members of the Sackler family, have tentatively reached the first comprehensive settlement in thousands of cases nationwide.
The tentative deal emerged after at least a year of talks, which had been intensifying in recent weeks.
The agreement must still be approved by Purdue’s board as well as a bankruptcy court judge.
The tentative deal was reached scarcely six weeks ahead of the start of the first federal trial in the sprawling opioid litigation before a federal judge in Cleveland, in which Purdue was a defendant. The judge, Dan A. Polster, recently issued tough pretrial rulings against groups of defendants in that case — drug manufacturers in addition to Purdue, as well as drug distributors and chain retailers. Although other manufacturers have already settled in that case, as well as in an earlier state opioid trial in Oklahoma, the Purdue agreement is the first so-called “global” arrangement. Negotiated by a team of five lawyers representing plaintiffs in nearly 2,300 lawsuits in federal court, as well as by lawyers for the states, the resolution would end most of the cases against Purdue.
But because the deal falls short of what some state attorneys general were seeking, many have said that they will continue to pursue the Sacklers. In recent weeks, perhaps in anticipation of legal fortresses built by the Sacklers to guard their fortune, which Forbes estimated to be about $13 billion, more states, including Virginia, New Mexico and Delaware, filed cases against members of the family. States have used an array of legal tactics, hoping to win an even bigger payout from the Sacklers and to force them out of the pharmaceutical business altogether.
