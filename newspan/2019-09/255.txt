CRUDO, by Olivia Laing. (Norton, $14.95.) Kathy, the central character of this slim, gutsy debut novel, is Laing herself, but also Kathy Acker, the iconoclastic writer who died in 1997. Dropping in quotes from Acker and others as she tells the story of a London-based woman’s anxious adjustment to marriage and to momentous Trump- and Brexit-era political change, Laing writes with “bristling intelligence,” our reviewer, Katie Kitamura, said.
PIRANHAS: The Boy Bosses of Naples, by Roberto Saviano, translated by Antony Shugaar. (Picador, $18.) The author of “Gomorrah,” a journalistic account of the Neapolitan Mafia, turns to fiction to portray another corner of that world through the story of a vicious teenage gang whose members aspire to be Mafia bosses. Saviano “knows how to keep his narrative hurtling forward like the scooters his young hoodlums ride at life-endangering speeds,” our reviewer, John Hooper, wrote.
A LIFE OF MY OWN, by Claire Tomalin. (Penguin, $17.) Tomalin, a longtime literary editor and the renowned biographer of Thomas Hardy and Samuel Pepys, tells her own story in this eventful, sometimes tragic memoir written at age 84. “There is genuine appeal in watching this indomitable woman continue to chase the next draft of herself,” The Times’s Dwight Garner wrote.
