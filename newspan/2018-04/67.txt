A frame from a video obtained by The Daily Orange, Syracuse’s student newspaper, in which members of the Theta Tau fraternity mime oral sex and use racial slurs.
Syracuse University suspended an engineering fraternity on Wednesday after footage surfaced of members speaking and acting in ways “that are extremely racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, sexist and hostile to people with disabilities,” the university’s chancellor said.
The video — which The Daily Orange, Syracuse’s independent student newspaper, obtained and published after the university declined to release it, citing its continuing investigation — includes a pledge “to always have hatred in my heart” for African-Americans, Hispanics and Jews, all of whom are referred to with slurs. One member of the fraternity, Theta Tau, tells Jews to get in the shower, an allusion to the Nazis’ gas chambers. The video, about six minutes long, also shows members of the fraternity laughing while pretending to masturbate each other and perform oral sex.
By midafternoon Wednesday, the chapter’s website and Facebook page were no longer accessible. Three student leaders listed on a cached version of the website did not respond to emails seeking comment.
Theta Tau is not the first fraternity, nor Syracuse the first university, to be involved in a scandal involving racism or sexism. In 2015, Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed its University of Oklahoma chapter — and two students were expelled — after members were filmed chanting that African-Americans would never be allowed to join. Last year, Cornell University’s Psi Upsilon chapter was shuttered after people believed to be involved in it attacked a black student. And just last week, California Polytechnic State University suspended Lambda Chi Alpha after a member was pictured in blackface.
Students note that these problems, though perhaps more prominent in Greek organizations, are not confined to them.
That treatment routinely includes slurs, Mr. McMonagle said in an interview.
