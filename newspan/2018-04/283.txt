The union representing theater performers said on Wednesday that it was beginning a national campaign to persuade the Tony Awards to create annual prizes for ensembles and choruses.
The Tonys, which each year recognize work in plays and musicals on Broadway, currently honor performances only by actors in leading and supporting roles. But many regional theater contests honor the work of the rest of the cast — for example, the Jeff Awards in Chicago have an annual prize for the best ensemble.
Equity is proposing two awards, one for the best ensemble — which it defined as the entire cast — in a musical or play, and one for the best chorus — which it defined as a group that sings or dances, or both — in a musical or play.
This season’s Tony Awards ceremony will be held on June 10 at Radio City Music Hall, and broadcast on CBS. Among the categories this year: best sound design, in a play and in a musical — categories that had previously been eliminated and have now been reinstated.
Tony Awards administrators declined to comment.
