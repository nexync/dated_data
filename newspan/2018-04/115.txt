How does the most debased, dishonest president in American history attack people who have spent their lives upholding the rule of law?
What’s astonished me about Donald Trump is how effectively he’s managed to take his opponents’ strengths and turn them against them. It’s a type of political jujitsu that we saw back in 2004 when John Kerry was being “Swift-boated.” John Kerry is no war hero. I know John Kerry is lying about his first Purple Heart. -It was shocking at the time. And what we’re seeing now is, is that on steroids. John McCain, he is a war hero. He’s a war hero ’cause he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured, O.K.? I hate to tell you. The world has turned upside down if Donald Trump is accusing people like this of not having integrity. Whether it’s Jim Comey – He’s a showboat. He’s a grandstander. – or Rod Rosenstein These people have the biggest conflicts of interest I’ve ever seen. Or Robert Mueller, who have spent their lives working to uphold the rule of law, he doesn’t care. It’s not to say that James Comey is a saint or that Rod Rosenstein has never made a mistake in his life. It’s to say that I don’t think anyone can dispute that these men are people who have devoted their lives and their careers to upholding the law. And they are being attacked on those grounds by the least law abiding president we’ve ever had. Should Donald Trump be impeached? I hope not. Because I think impeaching and removing Donald Trump from office would let the American people off the hook. There’s just no way, short of Donald Trump eating live babies in the Oval Office, There is no way he’s going to be impeached. There aren’t the votes in Congress. The American people are going to have to deal with this problem by showing up at the polls, by expressing their values, and by voting in people who will uphold those values.
