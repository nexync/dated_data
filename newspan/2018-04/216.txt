Barbara Bush, wife of the 41st president and mother of the 43rd, died on Tuesday at the age of 92, prompting an outpouring of tributes and remembrances.
On both sides of the aisle, lawmakers joined him in emphasizing Mrs. Bush’s support for literacy programs. Through the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy and other outlets, it was one of her most treasured causes.
“Through her own work to promote literacy as a value in every American home, countless families now have the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in all aspects of their lives,” President Jimmy Carter said in a statement.
Mrs. Bush is survived by her husband, her brother, five children, 17 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, many of whom shared tributes of their own.
“My grandmother’s entire life was focused on others,” wrote George P. Bush, whose father is Jeb Bush.
President George W. Bush, her son, said she was “so much more” than her public persona.
Many people noted the priority she placed on her family, despite her career in the public eye.
“We’re even more grateful for the way she lived her life — as a testament to the fact that public service is an important and noble calling,” they wrote.
