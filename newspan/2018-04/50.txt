What’s the Best Medicine for a Cough?
Q. My cold is better, but I can’t stop coughing. Isn’t there a cold medicine that works?
A. The search for an effective cough medicine can be frustrating.
When over-the-counter products fail, cough sufferers often look for “something stronger” — namely codeine, widely regarded as the standard by which cough medicines are measured. Much of the interest in codeine dates from a 1950 experiment, unlikely to be undertaken today, in which 17 Swedish medical students agreed to inhale ammonia fumes. The cough that ensued was modestly ameliorated by pretreatment with escalating doses of codeine.
Codeine has a chemically similar cousin, dextromethorphan — the “DM” component of many cough medicines. But a systematic review concluded that dextromethorphan was about as good as honey at reducing cough frequency. Both codeine and dextromethorphan carry the potential for abuse and have serious side effects that have led to warnings from the Food and Drug Administration.
So what to do for a persistent cough after a cold? Stay hydrated, use a humidifier, and be patient. A cough from a cold will usually resolve within three weeks. You could also try honey, as it seems to be as effective as over-the-counter products. But don’t cough up money for unproven and potentially unsafe medications.
