Madonna has lost a legal battle to prevent the auction of her intimate memorabilia, including satin underwear and a letter from her former boyfriend, the rapper Tupac Shakur.
But in a decision made public Monday, Justice Lebovits dismissed the case on the grounds that the statute of limitations to recover the items had passed. The belongings, which also included intimate photographs, a hairbrush and cassette tapes of unreleased recordings, were set to be sold by the online auction site GottaHaveRockandRoll.com last year.
The auction house said the online sale of the items will now go ahead in July. The starting bid for the handwritten Shakur letter is $100,000.
Some of the items were provided for the sale by Darlene Lutz, Madonna’s former friend and art consultant, who was also named as a defendant in the suit. Monday’s ruling also said that a 2004 settlement agreement between Ms. Lutz and Madonna prevented the singer from suing for the items.
However, Ms. Lutz added, “She didn’t take the route that Beyoncé did” — a reference to the pop star’s exhaustive personal archiving system.
Madonna’s representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The singer had previously said she did not know Ms. Lutz was in possession of the items until last year when the gossip site TMZ published the letter from Shakur.
Dated Jan. 15, 1995, the letter was written during Shakur’s incarceration at New York’s Clinton Correctional Facility for sexual assault, the year before his shooting death at age 25 in September 1996. In the letter, he alludes to his reasons for ending a relationship with Madonna.
Ms. Lutz said she did not even discover the Tupac letter until 2007 or 2008. By then, she and Madonna had fallen out — they had not seen each other in more than a decade until the depositions in this case, Ms. Lutz said — though she continued to recognize the singer’s artistic importance, and therefore the demand for items from her past.
