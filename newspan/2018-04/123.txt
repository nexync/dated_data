So I asked Ms. Rogers: Could the risotto be made with a less ferocious green that’s also easier to find if you’re not running around British fields in your shorts?
Ms. Rogers then gave me a risotto reminder. Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need to stir risotto continuously as it cooks. Once you’re attuned to the rhythm of adding the broth, she told me, you can stir intermittently; just stay close by.
Risotto has been a menu staple at the River Café ever since Ms. Rogers and her partner Rose Gray opened it in 1987. Three decades later, the restaurant is a different place — bigger and more ambitious, though sadly without Ms. Gray, who died of cancer in 2010.
