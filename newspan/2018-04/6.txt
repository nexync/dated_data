The stock market is forward-looking. That’s a problem when there’s not much to look forward to.
Last year, investors might have shrugged off those concerns, preferring to focus on the buoyant global economy and the prospect of a major reduction in American corporate tax rates.
That tax cut came to fruition in December, and it supercharged corporate profits, but that was a one-time event.
Other events are looming, and investors see little to be excited about. With congressional elections later this year, the prospects of pro-business legislation — or any legislation, for that matter — are dim. The biggest economic action out of Washington might be the Fed raising interest rates — a clear negative for investors.
In short, it’s up to companies themselves to give investors reasons to believe their shares can keep climbing.
Recent earnings reports suggest that is becoming harder to do. Shares of Alphabet, the parent of Google, dropped sharply Tuesday despite the company reporting Monday that quarterly profits rose 73 percent to $9.4 billion. Investors appeared concerned with a surge of spending at the company that hurt its profit margins.
Earnings reports also provoked a sell-off in the industrial firms 3M and Caterpillar. Investors were rattled by lower sales and profit forecasts and by sluggish demand for the products that 3M sells to auto body shops. Its shares sank 6.8 percent.
And investors, after initially applauding Caterpillar’s first-quarter results, were unnerved when a Caterpillar executive told analysts that the first quarter might be a “high-water mark” for the year. The shares fell 6.2 percent.
The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index sank 1.3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average finished with a loss of 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1.7 percent.
The decline in the S.&P. on Tuesday left the benchmark index down 1.5 percent for the year.
