— From Tracy K. Smith’s “The Angels,” a poem in the collection “Wade in the Water” (Graywolf Press, 2018, Page 7). Smith, who currently serves as the U.S. poet laureate, is the author of three previous collections and one memoir.
How many fleeting associations combine to make up a life? How many rusty pipes do we mistake for owls? A vast majority of our waking hours are filled not with witty jokes or brilliant thoughts or epic feelings but with tiny, private mind-motions — thoughts that are hardly even thoughts at all, that don’t rise to the level of sharing with another human being. That millisecond when — again and again — a rusty pipe looks like an owl, or a newscaster’s voice reminds you of a long-gone uncle, or a daily routine sets off a small chain of involuntary associations. These things are almost nothing, and yet they are who we are.
When I put on deodorant in the morning, I involuntarily think the word “DEODOTANT.” This is because I once worked as a janitor, and that’s what somebody had written on a spray bottle that I was forced to look at every morning, half-asleep, at 4 a.m. Twenty years later, I carry that nonword around like a sacred incantation, a prayer I say to the rising sun each day: DEODOTANT. Our minds will catch anything and mount it like a prize.
Every time I drink a glass of water, I get an image of my father drinking a glass of milk, looking at me with smiling eyes. These things will never be part of anyone’s biography. Unless we tell one another, they disappear.
