The judge in the case, Allison D. Burroughs of the Federal District Court in Boston, has scheduled a hearing on April 10 for both sides to present oral arguments on whether the documents should be made public.
The two sides provided lengthy letters to Judge Burroughs, giving a preview of their arguments. The judge has set a trial date for next January, though Harvard in its letter said it was prepared to go to trial as soon as October.
One of Mr. Blum’s landmark cases was a lawsuit by Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who said she was denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin because of her race. The United States Supreme Court ruled 4-3 in favor of the university in 2016, saying that it is constitutional to use race as one of many factors in admissions decisions.
Students for Fair Admissions scoffed at the notion that the admissions procedure was akin to a trade secret. “This case does not involve anything like ‘national security, the formula for Coca-Cola or embarrassing details of private life,’ ” the group said, citing case law.
