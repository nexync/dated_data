Watch the trailer for “Caliphate,” a new podcast series from The New York Times about one reporter’s quest to understand the Islamic State.
The team behind “The Daily” presents a new podcast that follows Rukmini Callimachi to the front lines of the war against the Islamic State, and that seeks to comprehend the power and pull of its militants.
The New York Times has introduced a documentary audio series that follows Rukmini Callimachi, a foreign correspondent for The Times and a frequent voice on “The Daily,” as she reports on the Islamic State and the fall of the Iraqi city of Mosul. With the producer Andy Mills, Rukmini journeys to the heart of the conflict to grapple with the most pressing questions about ISIS and to comprehend the power and global pull of the militant group.
Today, instead of our usual show, we offer the Prologue and Chapter 1 of “Caliphate.” This episode includes disturbing language and scenes of graphic violence.
Each episode will be available to New York Times subscribers a week early, as a way to thank them for their support of this kind of reporting. If you’re a Times subscriber, you can get an early listen to the next episode here. If you’re not, consider becoming one. Either way, sign up to receive weekly dispatches from Rukmini and learn when new episodes are live.
• On five trips to Iraq, Times journalists scoured old Islamic State offices, gathering thousands of files abandoned by the militants.
• The documents that were unearthed reveal extreme brutality and detailed record-keeping.
“The Daily” will be back with a new episode on Friday.
