• Expectations are high as North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, prepares to meet this month with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. Both parties are working on a joint declaration and, according to a South Korean official, Mr. Kim will announce his willingness to denuclearize his country.
Mr. Moon is seeking a “comprehensive deal,” in which Mr. Kim commits to dismantling his nuclear arsenal and President Trump reciprocates with security guarantees, including a peace treaty and normalized relations.
Some U.S. hard-liners, like John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, reject that approach, saying that the North has no real intention of giving up nuclear weapons and only wants relief from sanctions.
The North’s motives will surely be discussed by Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, above, who arrived in Mar-a-Lago for meetings on trade and other issues. The White House later acknowledged that it had ssent the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo to North Korea to meet with Mr. Kim, to prepare for a summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump.
• Beijing sought to ease its trade dispute with Washington, offering to make it easier for foreign automakers and aerospace firms to own factories in China.
The move comes as Beijing said its economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter compared with last year — well ahead of the pace needed to hit its target of 6.5 percent growth for the year.
And the Chinese telecom giant Huawei laid off its top Washington liaison and other American employees — a move that suggests it has accepted that its political battles in the U.S. are unwinnable.
• In Syria, inspectors were seeking to enter Douma, a suburb of Damascus, where the U.S. and Western allies say President Bashar al-Assad’s forces dropped chemical weapons. Here’s a look at the group that sent the inspectors, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
And Syrian refugees in Turkey who are following the crackdown are reliving the trauma from a distance.
The White House, meanwhile, distanced itself from the U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, on Tuesday, as one of Mr. Trump’s advisers said she had gotten “ahead of the curve” in announcing new sanctions against Russia.
• Who will get the first look at materials seized last week from President Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen? No one, it seems.
A federal judge didn’t agree to let Mr. Trump’s team review the 10 boxes of documents and roughly a dozen electronic devices before prosecutors can. But she didn’t say prosecutors would get the first look either. Discussions will continue. Above, Mr. Cohen leaving court on Monday.
Separately, we looked at what effect James Comey’s book tour — and his pointed critiques of Mr. Trump — might have on the former F.B.I. director’s image as a principled professional.
In Pakistan, a new movement is pushing for civil rights for the ethnic Pashtun minority.
Its leaders accuse Pakistan’s military of detaining and even killing Pashtun men without due process. They’ve held large rallies in Peshawar and Karachi.
But news outlets are under heavy pressure not to cover the protests — and many fear a crackdown by the security forces could be imminent.

Some days, you wish the news would just stop.
That was the case for the BBC on this day in 1930, when its 8:45 evening bulletin was surprisingly brief: “Good evening. Today is Good Friday. There is no news,” the radio announcer said. That update was followed by 15 minutes of piano music.
There was some major world news that day, including a typhoon in the Philippines and an attempted raid on an armory by Indian revolutionaries demanding independence from Britain, but it happened too late for the BBC.
And what made the front page of The Times on April 18? In addition to stories about Prohibition violations, there was one about gas masks for horses that were doing well in military testing.
The next day’s front page reported on a plane crash in Jersey City, a deadly church fire in Romania, the weather forecast for Easter Sunday and a study that found that only 700 words were needed for the vast majority of telephone conversations.
These days, it can seem as if the amount of news is limited only by the time you have available to consume it. But if you need a break, here’s some classical piano.
