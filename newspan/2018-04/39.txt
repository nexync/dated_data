Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat of Illinois, gave birth to a daughter, Maile Pearl Bowlsbey, on Monday, making her the first United States senator to give birth while in office, she said in a statement.
“We’re also so grateful for the love and support of our friends and family, as well as our wonderful medical teams for everything they’ve done to help us in our decades-long journey to complete our family,” she said in a statement.
She said former Senator Daniel K. Akaka, a Democrat from Hawaii, “was able to bless her name for us” before his death last week. “His help in naming both of our daughters means he will always be with us,” she said.
Maile is also named for Pearl Bowlsbey Johnson, who was Mr. Bowlsbey’s great-aunt and an Army officer who served in World War II, Ms. Duckworth said.
Ms. Duckworth, 50, was already one of 10 women who had given birth while serving in Congress, having had Abigail in November 2014 as a member of the House of Representatives. But Maile’s arrival made her the first United States senator to give birth while in office.
Ms. Duckworth announced her pregnancy on social media in January and, in an interview with The Chicago Sun-Times, described her struggle to become pregnant. Both daughters were conceived through in vitro fertilization.
“I’ve had multiple I.V.F. cycles and a miscarriage trying to conceive again, so we’re very grateful,” she told The Sun-Times. Her most recent miscarriage was during her 2016 Senate campaign, she said.
Since the birth of Abigail, Ms. Duckworth has introduced several bills aimed at making life easier for new parents, but none have been voted into law.
