Two American Lieutenants were awarded the French Croix de Guerre.
AMERICAN FRONT, FRANCE, April 18 — Presentation of the Croix de Guerre to Lieutenants Alan F. Winslow and Douglas Campbell was made to-day by the French. The formality took place in the presence of several French and American officers and caused embarrassment to the Americans who, on Sunday last, brought down two German aeroplanes in the nick of time.
The French officers complimented the youthful aviators and said that it was noted by the French that the distinguishing medal went to a man from each of the two American universities known to everyone in Europe — Yale and Harvard. Winslow is from Yale and Campbell from Harvard.
The correspondent assured them that without doubt all the American folk had heard of it already.
