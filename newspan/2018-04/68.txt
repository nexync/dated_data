Lars von Trier, the Danish film director who was declared persona non grata by the Cannes Film Festival in 2011 for his remarks about Hitler, will make a Cannes comeback this year: His movie “The House That Jack Built” will be presented out of the official competition.
Announcing the news on Thursday, the festival organizers also said that Terry Gilliam’s “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote” — a comic fantasy 18 years in the making that has been caught up in a legal dispute — will close this year’s festival as another out-of-competition title. The festival runs from May 8-19; officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the decision to include Mr. von Trier.
Mr. von Trier’s movie plots 12 years in the life of a serial killer, and stars Matt Dillon, Riley Keough and Uma Thurman.
The festival board voted to declare Mr. von Trier persona non grata. He was barred from that year’s prize ceremony or from entering the festival headquarters, although “Melancholia” stayed in the competition.
He attributed the comments to the fact that he was no longer drinking. 
Three directors were added to this year’s official competition on Thursday, including the Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, a Cannes regular, who won the Palme d’Or in 2014 for “Winter Sleep.” His new title is “The Wild Pear Tree.” That brings the total number of films vying for the Palme d’Or to 21.
Earlier this week, the festival also revealed the composition of its main nine-member jury, which is being led this year by the actress Cate Blanchett. Jurors include the actresses Kristen Stewart and Léa Seydoux and the directors Ava DuVernay and Andrey Zvyagintsev.
Separately, the films chosen for the Directors’ Fortnight section of the festival were announced, including “Climax” by Gaspar Noé and “Le Monde est à Toi” by Romain Gavras, son of the Greek-born director Costa-Gavras.
