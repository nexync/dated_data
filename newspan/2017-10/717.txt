A notorious New York City landlord who pleaded guilty last month to grand larceny and other felony charges, stemming from his involvement in elaborate tax and mortgage fraud schemes, began his own one-year residency on Tuesday on Rikers Island.
The surrender and formal sentencing of the landlord, Steven Croman, followed a yearlong investigation by the New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, that revealed Mr. Croman falsified payroll records and padded out the value of his more than 140 buildings, ultimately securing over $45 million in mortgage refinancing under false pretenses.
A regular on “worst landlord” lists, Mr. Croman, 51, also plunged rent-stabilized units into decrepitude in an effort to push out tenants, according to the investigation’s findings.
In June, Mr. Croman, who had faced up to 25 years in prison for a litany of charges brought against him in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, pleaded guilty to grand larceny, falsifying business records and criminal tax fraud.
None of the criminal charges were related to Mr. Croman’s treatment of tenants; a civil suit against Mr. Croman brought by the attorney general’s office on behalf of several tenants is ongoing.
As part of the plea agreement, Mr. Croman must also pay $5 million in a tax settlement to the state, the announcement said. He has already paid $3 million.
