Usually, the spirit behind Karole Armitage’s dance projects has more in common with Neo-Classicism than with ghosts. But Ms. Armitage, who was given the label of punk ballerina in the 1980s — and still wears it proudly — has choreographed a Halloween show.
And children are welcome. “Halloween Unleashed: Dancing Bones, Tasting Darkness and the Skeleton Within,” her 55-minute, dreamlike work that opens at La MaMa on Friday, was inspired by Disney’s animated “The Skeleton Dance” from 1929. Along with Disney, the production melds the spirit of Haitian carnival and New York’s late-1970s no-wave scene: Skeletons dance, a vengeful ghost appears and a pair of red shoes work their evil magic.
With multiple costumes changes and sections that include music by Marilyn Manson, Fats Waller, Wyclef Jean and Theoretical Girls — a no-wave band formed by Glenn Branca and Jeffrey Lohn in 1977 — the work, as summed up by Ms. Armitage’s longtime dancer, the elegant Megumi Eda, is “more like a Broadway show” than what Ms. Armitage usually does.
Ms. Armitage wanted something that reached beyond Disney or Saint-Saëns: “I wanted to make it gritty and street,” she said.
