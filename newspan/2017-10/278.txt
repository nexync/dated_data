The prolific choreographer Lar Lubovitch will celebrate the 50th anniversary of his company next spring with a world premiere — and some help from the Martha Graham Dance Company and the Joffrey Ballet.
The Lar Lubovitch Dance Company is to perform two anniversary programs at the Joyce Theater from April 17 through April 22. In addition, the dancers will make an appearance at the 92nd Street Y’s Fridays at Noon series on April 6, the troupe announced on Thursday.
“Wanderers,” Mr. Lubovitch’s latest work, which is set to choral music by Schubert, will have its premiere as part of the Joyce season. Also on the lineup is a revival of “Men’s Stories: A Concerto in Ruin” (2000), one of Mr. Lubovitch’s beloved dances, which also appeared on the company’s 45th-anniversary program.
The Martha Graham Dance Company will join for “Legend of Ten,” Mr. Lubovitch’s 2010 work set to Brahms’s Piano Quintet in F minor. And dancers from the Joffrey Ballet will perform a quartet from “Othello,” an evening-length work that Mr. Lubovitch made for American Ballet Theater in 1997.
