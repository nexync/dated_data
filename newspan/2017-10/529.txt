The New Museum may have a relatively modest budget for its expansion — $85 million — but the institution has selected a big-name architect to design it: Rem Koolhaas.
The museum is to announce on Wednesday that Mr. Koolhaas and Shohei Shigematsu of OMA will design a new building on the adjacent property at 231 Bowery, which the institution purchased in 2008. This would be the first public project in New York City for OMA, the firm founded by Mr. Koolhaas.
The structure, which will connect to the museum’s Sanaa-designed building, will double the museum’s footprint on the Bowery, providing an additional 50,000 square feet for galleries, improved public circulation, and flexible space for the institution’s more experimental programs like its business incubator and the urban-policy think tank that it runs.
Ms. Phillips said the museum has raised more than 50 percent of the cost, which includes endowment funds, and that the project is to break ground in 2019.
