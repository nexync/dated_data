LAS VEGAS — One by one under the spotlights, the Vegas Golden Knights skated up to take their place behind a first responder to the shooting massacre.
The arena then illuminated the victims’ names in gold on the ice during 58 seconds of silence.
Hockey seemed distant and unimportant to the players on the N.H.L.’s newest team in recent days, but the Golden Knights knew they had to play Tuesday night — for their city, for their fans and for the fallen.
Tomas Nosek scored the first home goal in franchise history just 2:31 into the first period. Deryk Engelland added his first goal for his adopted hometown’s new team moments later in a stirring performance by the player selected by his teammates to give a pregame speech to the crowd.
Marc-Andre Fleury made 31 saves for the Golden Knights, who became the first team in N.H.L. history to begin their debut season with three straight wins.
Just nine days after the massacre occurred less than a mile from T-Mobile Arena, the Golden Knights reverently honored the victims and heroes before the long-awaited home debut of the city’s first major professional sports franchise.
