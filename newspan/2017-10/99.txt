Mr. Trump greeted the mayor but did not invite her to speak, recognizing instead Mr. Rosselló, who the president said “did not play politics,” and Puerto Rico’s congressional representative, who lavishly applauded the administration’s performance.

As late as Monday afternoon, some aides were urging the president to delay the visit, which came a day before he was scheduled to fly to Las Vegas to meet with law enforcement officials and victims of Sunday’s mass shooting there.
