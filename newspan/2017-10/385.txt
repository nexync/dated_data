Mr. Glor’s appointment, which will be effective later this year, is the latest example of news executives turning to in-house talent who don’t have outsize public personas — or command the highest salaries in the news business — for the evening anchor role.
The CBS evening newscast has long been mired in third place behind NBC and ABC, and it will be up to Mr. Glor, 42, to turn things around.
For the current season, “CBS Evening News” is averaging 6.2 million viewers, with 1.3 million viewers in the all-important 25-to-54-year-old bracket, according to Nielsen. The total is more than two million fewer than ABC’s newscast with David Muir. Both ABC and NBC attract roughly 500,000 more viewers in the 25-to-54 demographic.
Mr. Glor is by no means a household name, though many news executives argue that that’s not as important as it was in the days of Brokaw, Jennings and Rather.
Mr. Muir was an 11-year-veteran of ABC News before being tapped to replace Diane Sawyer; Lester Holt had been at NBC News for 15 years before becoming the emergency — and then the permanent — replacement for Brian Williams.
Indeed, the biggest star power and highest salaries have shifted to the morning hours, where the revenue and profits are significantly higher than in the evening. Megyn Kelly, whom NBC is paying more than $15 million a year, was given a show at 9 a.m. on weekdays. Though she has a Sunday evening show, which is on hiatus, that is not nearly as important to the network as her morning gig, which is off to a rough start in the ratings.
