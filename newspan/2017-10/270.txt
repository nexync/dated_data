Kevin Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner, apologized Sunday night for what he said “would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior” after the actor Anthony Rapp made an accusation about his sexual conduct with him 31 years ago, when Mr. Rapp was 14 years old.
Mr. Rapp, who is best known for playing the character Mark Cohen in the original Broadway production of “Rent,” confirmed the contents of the article and said he had decided to speak out at a time when several women have accused the producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault.
Mr. Spacey had not responded to requests for comment from BuzzFeed. But a few hours after the article was published, he posted a statement to Twitter, saying he was “horrified” but did not remember the encounter.
Mr. Rapp said he met Mr. Spacey in 1986 when both were performing in Broadway shows. Mr. Rapp was a child actor in a new play called “Precious Sons,” while Mr. Spacey, then 26, was performing in a revival of “Long Day’s Journey Into Night.” Mr. Rapp told BuzzFeed that he met Mr. Spacey at a Broadway party that year, and that Mr. Spacey invited him to the party where the sexual advance occurred.
Erin Quill, an actress, said Mr. Rapp told her of his allegation years ago. “He told me the story in 1992 and I stand by Anthony’s account,” she said in an email on Sunday night.
Mr. Spacey’s decision to cite homosexuality as part of a response to an accusation that he made a sexual advance on a minor drew criticism from some on social media.
