RIO DE JANEIRO — The Brazilian police shot and killed a Spanish tourist in a neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro on Monday after the car she was riding in failed to stop at a police roadblock, the Brazilian authorities said.
The Rio police confirmed in a written statement that the tourist, María Esperanza Ruiz Jiménez, 67, died after being shot by a police officer in the Rocinha favela, or slum.
The Rio state security secretariat, which oversees all police forces, said the shooting would be investigated.
Rocinha has been the scene of severe violence for a month as rival gangs have clashed with each other for control over the drug trade. Intense shootouts between the gangs and also with police officers have taken place almost daily.
Increased violence has also been reported in several other neighborhoods in Rio, which hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics.
For several months the police have struggled to maintain control of the city. President Michel Temer in July authorized the use of about 9,000 army soldiers to help patrol Rio, but it has had little effect on tamping down the violence.
