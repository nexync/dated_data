Marilyn Manson, the provocative rock star, was injured on Saturday night during a concert at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan after a stage prop of two giant guns fell on him.
His publicist, Carrie Tolles, said that Mr. Manson’s injury occurred toward the end of his show and that he was being treated at a hospital. Ms. Tolles did not detail the nature or severity of Mr. Manson’s injuries, or offer specifics about how they happened.
Mr. Manson will be postponing nine tour dates — from an Oct. 2 show in Boston through an Oct. 14 concert in Houston — which will be rescheduled. A statement from Ms. Tolles said, “Manson hopes to return to the stage soon,” and that the musician will be recuperating at home in Los Angeles.
Videos from inside the venue appeared to show Mr. Manson, pulling on the stage prop before it crashed down while music played in the background. Mr. Manson, 48, was performing his cover of Eurythmics’ “Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)” at the time of the incident.
The concert was the third stop on a world tour for Mr. Manson, whose 10th studio album, “Heaven Upside Down,” is scheduled to be released on Friday.
