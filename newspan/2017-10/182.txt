Good morning on this soggy Monday.
Five years ago, New York City’s deadliest hurricane in modern history barreled through our neighborhoods, flooding houses, lifting cars and shutting down power in some areas.
By the time Hurricane Sandy had passed, it had killed 43 people in New York City (more than half of whom were in Staten Island) and caused $19 billion in damage here.
And it could happen again sooner than you might think.
According to a new study, storms that bring Sandy-like flooding to New York City could happen every five years by 2030.

Halloween looks charming: It should be mostly sunny during the day, and as you head out to trick-or-treat the temperature should hover in the mid-50s.
