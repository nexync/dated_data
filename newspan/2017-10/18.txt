Outcroppings of rocks hundreds of millions of years old occur naturally in Central Park, but even more exotic gems and minerals will be vividly on display across the street when the American Museum of Natural History’s new Allison and Roberto Mignone Halls of Gems and Minerals open in 2019 in conjunction with the museum’s 150th anniversary.
Among the recently acquired specimens is a towering 12-foot amethyst geode from Uruguay, which will be on display in the museum’s Grand Gallery through this year’s winter holidays.
The renovated gallery will also display the Star of India blue sapphire, the 632-carat Patricia Emerald and the “Subway Garnet,” a nine-pound gem unearthed during the excavation for a sewer in Midtown Manhattan in 1885.
Ralph Appelbaum Associates designed the 11,000-square-foot transformation of the Morgan Memorial Hall of Gems and Harry Frank Guggenheim Hall of Minerals to showcase 4,500 specimens, explain how scientists classify them and illuminate how humans have used them for personal adornment, tools and technology.
A Crystalline Pass will link the Mignone Halls of Gems and Minerals to the new Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education and Innovation, which is scheduled to open in 2020. Roberto Mignone is a museum trustee. Allison Mignone is vice chairwoman of the museum’s capital campaign.
The current mineral and gem halls will close on Oct. 26. The museum’s collection includes about 105,000 minerals and 5,000 gems.
Last month, the museum announced plans to renovate its Northwest Coast Hall, which houses exhibits on the culture of people indigenous to the region from Washington State to Alaska.
