We See Others’ Failures as Courageous. We See Our Own as Shameful. Why?
Will you try something with me?
Grab a blank piece of paper, draw a line right down the middle and think of the last time you saw someone fail. It might take you a minute to remember. Got it? Now, on the left side of the paper, write down a few words describing how that failure made you think about that person.
 I bet it won’t take nearly as long to recall. On the right side of the paper, jot down a few words describing how that failure made you think about yourself.
Finally, compare the two. If you’re like me, you probably had one or both of the following things happen.
1. When you tried to remember someone else’s failure, you couldn’t. But when you thought of your own, you had a laundry list of recollections.
2. The left side, where you considered that other person, had words like compassion, courage and bravery. The right side had words like shame and stupidity.
Isn’t it interesting that when others fail, we tend to admire them for trying? Yet when we fail, we beat ourselves up for the very same thing. Not only that, but isn’t it also amazing how quickly we forgive and forget other people’s mistakes and how long we hold onto our own?
Are you cool with this? Because I’m not.
Something needs to change, and it’s not the part about how forgiving we are of others’ failures.
What if we just extended ourselves the same grace?
Try it, and after you do, tell me about it: hello@behaviorgap.com.
