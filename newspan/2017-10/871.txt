BERLIN — Hertha Berlin nodded to social struggles in the United States by kneeling before its Bundesliga home game on Saturday.
Hertha’s starting lineup linked arms and took a knee on the soccer field, while Pal Dardai’s coaching staff, General Manager Michael Preetz, club officials and substitutes took a knee off it before playing Schalke.
The club and forward Salomon Kalou also voiced their support on the social media network Twitter.
“We wanted to make a stand against racism,” Hertha’s captain, Per Skjelbred, said after the team’s 2-0 defeat.
The action was intended to show solidarity with N.F.L. players who have been protesting police treatment of blacks and social injustice in the United States by kneeling, sitting or locking arms through the national anthem before games.
Last year, Colin Kaepernick started the movement, which has been harshly criticized by President Trump.
