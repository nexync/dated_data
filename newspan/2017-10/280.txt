A group of white nationalists briefly protested in Charlottesville, Va., on Saturday night, eight weeks after a rally there turned violent.
“No disorders occurred during this rally,” the police said. Mr. Spencer then boarded a bus, which was followed by police officers “to ensure that the group was leaving the city,” according to the statement.
A video posted by Mr. Spencer showed dozens of people — mostly men in white collared shirts — marching with lit torches through downtown Charlottesville toward Emancipation Park, where a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee remained under a tarp while it awaits removal.
The video also showed that the demonstrators chanted and listened to brief speeches before leaving the park.
Charlottesville has become a popular place for members of the alt-right, a fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist positions, to gather because of controversy surrounding the Lee statue. In addition to the white nationalist rallies, members of the Ku Klux Klan rallied in Charlottesville in July to protest the statue’s removal.
The City Council voted narrowly in April to remove the statue of Lee. But in May, a Circuit Court judge issued a six-month injunction to halt its removal after a collection of individuals and groups — including the Virginia chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans — filed a lawsuit against the city.
