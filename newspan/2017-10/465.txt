Laurie Anderson, Cindy Sherman, Lynn Nottage, and hundreds of other artists, writers, curators and directors have signed an open letter condemning the publisher of Artforum, Knight Landesman, and pledging to fight against sexism and sexual harassment in the art world.
Mr. Landesman resigned from his longtime post as publisher of the magazine on Wednesday after a lawsuit was filed accusing him of sexually harassing at least nine women. More women have since come forward with stories alleging his misconduct. Michelle Kuo, the magazine’s editor in chief, also resigned, and the magazine’s staff posted a note criticizing its publisher. A spokesperson for the magazine said all contact with Mr. Landesman has been suspended, and that while three advertisers have pulled out of future issues, far more have pledged their continued support to the magazine.
