Stephanie Zerwas, the clinical director of the Center of Excellence for Eating Disorders at the University of North Carolina, was trying to find a restaurant in Orlando, Fla., last weekend, so she put the address into Google Maps for directions.
She was baffled to see a new feature: The iPhone app told her that walking instead of driving would burn 70 calories. While it was perhaps meant as an incentive to walk, those with eating disorders might instead fixate on the number, a dangerous mind-set that counselors try to minimize, she said.
Calorie counting has long been a contentious topic at the nexus of nutrition, exercise and eating disorders. In New York, among other cities, some restaurants are required to post calorie numbers on their menus and displays, an effort the Trump administration is trying to overturn. The Affordable Care Act required some national restaurants to do the same, though the Food and Drug Administration repeatedly delayed the deadline.
The practice is intended to encourage Americans to eat more thoughtfully and limit their intake of high-calorie food, as the nation battles widespread obesity. A recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that 12.5 percent of children were obese, up from 5 percent in 1980. Over all, 26.5 percent of the United States population is obese.
But critics have argued that calorie counting is an ineffective strategy to change eating habits. And Claire Mysko, the chief executive of the National Eating Disorders Association, said in an interview that calorie counts “can become a point of obsession” to those with eating disorders.
