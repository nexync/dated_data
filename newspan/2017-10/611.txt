A bogus headline on the Dow Jones Newswire was the result of a technology test gone awry, the company said.
The Dow Jones Newswire headline seemed too far-fetched to be true. And it was.
“Google to buy Apple for $9 billion,” it read.
Was there a hack? Had the tech world gone mad?
Neither, it turned out. The bogus headline was accidentally sent out to Dow Jones subscribers around the world on Tuesday morning. Before readers realized it was not true, there was a slight bump in Apple’s stock price.
The outlandish headline and story were, in reality, part of a technology test and not intended for publication. Dow Jones, a subsidiary of News Corp., asked subscribers to “disregard the headlines” and removed the erroneous reports from the newswire.
But by then, the mistake had been picked up by social media.
