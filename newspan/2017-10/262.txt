Two New York City police detectives are under investigation by the Brooklyn district attorney’s office after they were accused of raping an 18-year-old girl while she was in their custody, city officials said.
The detectives, both with the Brooklyn South Narcotics unit, have been placed on administrative leave, according to Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a Police Department spokeswoman.
The woman’s lawyer, Michael David, said the attack occurred around 8 p.m. on Sept. 15. He said the detectives, Edward Martins and Richard Hall, were in plain clothes in an unmarked van when they pulled over the woman, who was in a car with two male friends in Calvert Vaux Park in Brooklyn.
Immediately after, the woman was ordered out of the car, placed in handcuffs and put into the back seat of the detectives’ black Dodge van, Mr. David said. She was told she would be driven to the 60th Precinct, about a mile and a half from the park.
The Police Department’s Internal Affairs Bureau has not yet interviewed the two detectives, or their supervisor, Sgt. John Espey, according to a police official who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to discuss the situation. The Internal Affairs Bureau typically waits for prosecutors to finish investigating allegations against officers before interviewing them.
Sergeant Espey has also been put on modified duty, the police said. On modified duty, police officers are typically stripped of their firearms and badges and assigned administrative tasks.
A decade ago, prosecutors dismissed hundreds of criminal cases after it was determined they had been tainted by members of the Brooklyn South Narcotics unit, who had used seized drugs to bribe alleged criminals.
