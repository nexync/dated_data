Eminem is far from the first rapper to trash the current American president.
But America’s truth ain’t ignorin’ the votes.
Yet Eminem’s “The Storm,” a scathing four-minute attack on the “kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust,” which he debuted at the BET Awards on Tuesday night, has already overshadowed all of these previous anti-Trump musical efforts. It’s made major news headlines. It’s already garnered 8.7 million views on YouTube. And there have been some two million tweets about the performance, with praise pouring in from stars including LeBron James and Ellen DeGeneres.
What gives? Some see the overwhelming reaction to the rap as evidence of racism — that Eminem’s song is generating such overwhelming attention because he’s white. There’s no denying that the key difference between the rappers mentioned above and Eminem isn’t that he’s the only one from Detroit.
When Kendrick Lamar blasts Mr. Trump, he is preaching to the choir. When Eminem does it, there’s a good chance Trump voters are actually listening.
In 1990, Michael Jordan refused to endorse a North Carolina Democratic candidate on the grounds that “Republicans buy sneakers, too.” Many have suggested that this logic muffles pop stars like Taylor Swift, who was mum during the presidential election and whose silence persists.
Eminem knows that Republicans buy songs — his songs — too. His message to them is to stop buying. After focusing on the evils of the “racist 94-year-old grandpa” in the White House, he gives his Trump-supporting fans an ultimatum. “I’m drawing in the sand a line: you’re either for or against,” he says. “And if you can’t decide who you like more and you’re split/On who you should stand beside, I’ll do it for you with this,” he adds, giving his middle finger to the camera.
Those fans heard him loud and clear. Many vowed to never listen to his music again.
Eminem isn’t the first entertainer to part ways with his conservative fans. In 2003, the chart-topping Dixie Chicks criticized George W. Bush at a concert: The band’s lead singer Natalie Maines said they were “ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas.” They got crushed for it — their No. 1 single at the time fell off the charts. Their experience served as a cautionary tale for other liberal country stars, but it’s a message that apparently didn’t reach Eminem.
Or did it? While the Dixie Chicks aren’t exactly superstars, they’ve built a solid new fan base with politically tinged concerts — in June, the group performed in front of a giant image of Mr. Trump defaced to look like a devil with horns and a goatee. A cynic might say that Eminem, who is reported to be coming out with a new album next month, is following a similar playbook.
