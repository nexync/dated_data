On Wednesday, Pooja Jhunjhunwala, a State Department spokeswoman, said that the department was aware of the documents and noted that the United States government had declassified other documents related to America’s relations with Indonesia in the 1960s.
“The State Department supports the declassification of any relevant documents from the period which do not pose a national security risk,” she said in a statement.
