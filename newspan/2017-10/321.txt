Last summer, I happened to meet two authors whose books sent me into a World War II reading binge. Lynne Olson’s “Last Hope Island” chronicles the story of the Poles, French, Dutch and other Europeans who took refuge in Britain and fought to liberate their homelands from there. This was a discovery and led me to her previous books, including “Citizens of London” and “The Murrow Boys,” the latter written with her husband, Stanley Cloud, and both remarkable accounts of Americans in the wartime British capital. I also loved “The Jersey Brothers,” by Sally Mott Freeman, about three brothers in the Navy. The oldest was on the USS Enterprise carrier in the Pacific. The middle one, Freeman’s father, set up Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Map Room to track the war. The youngest was captured by the Japanese and the book is the story of the search for this brother, missing in action. So powerful, so richly researched.
