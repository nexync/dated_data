It was 10 years ago that I threw the keys down on my bossâ€™s desk and walked out the door of his Midtown Manhattan restaurant. I needed the money, but not that badly.
Hiking up Eighth Avenue toward Central Park that day, I was reminded of the first time I played hooky, and the way I had been surprised as a child that life went on as I whiled away my time.
Happy to be part of the real world for once, I let all of the angry drivers go ahead of me, turn in front of me against the light, whatever.
It was a nice day, warm and humid, and I carried the paperback I had known I would need up to Belvedere Castle and read it as the day passed into evening. Anxiety proffered itself at the ends of paragraphs and pages, but I did my best to tamp it down as I watched the sun set on my stolen afternoon.
It got so bad that I had to stop reading and, in tears, decided I would go to my boss to see whether he would take me back.
I lay back down on the bench where I had been sitting and listened to the tale of the star-crossed lovers until the night surrounded me with a solid darkness.
It took me a few weeks to find another job, but it was worth it.
