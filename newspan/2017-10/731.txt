A by-no-means exhaustive list of things T’s editors are interested in on a given week. This week, a Valentino pop-up, a Maria Cornejo moment, a watch book filled with stories — and puffer coats for dogs.
The fashion designer Maria Cornejo has always had her nose in a book, in one way or another. She remembers her girlhood self as a “big bookworm” and, last month, she became the subject of a newly published Rizzoli monograph, “Maria Cornejo: Zero 1997-2017+.” “It’s quite emotional to look back on your life and associate the work that went into this,” she tells T in an email, noting that her son, Joey, is the same age as her original NoLIta studio and store. (Her daughter, Bibi, was 6 ½ when that space opened; the entire operation moved to NoHo in 2009.) “To think about how we’ve grown and what we have accomplished is really powerful,” Cornejo says. This history is portrayed in the volume’s pages via sketches and fit notes, an introduction by Nicole Phelps and an interview with Tim Blanks, photographs by Cornejo’s husband, Mark Borthwick, and other memorabilia.
