• President Trump’s disavowal of the Iran nuclear deal is the latest case in which his denunciations are stronger than his actions, raising the question of whether he takes maximalist positions as a negotiating stance.
A number of his decisions leave Congress in the awkward position of deciding on unpopular or divisive next steps. In the case of Iran, lawmakers have 60 days to to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions. Here’s where things stand on Iran, immigration and health care, as well as the Nafta trade deal.
Dean Baquet, The Times’s executive editor, held a public discussion of the challenges of covering the Trump administration with two White House correspondents and our media columnist. Here are seven takeaways.
• Does a warming planet really need more coal?
One of the most fervent environmental campaigns in Australia’s history could also be a tipping point in the global campaign against coal.
The issue: an Indian conglomerate’s proposal to create one of the largest coal mines in the world, carrying the promise of thousands of new jobs — in a country that already produces more coal than any other nation except China, the U.S. and India. Above, the Abbot Point coal terminal in Queensland.

This month, the Trump administration expanded health insurance exemptions for employers, allowing them to deny women coverage for contraception.
Margaret Sanger, who opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S. on this day in 1916, might have had something to say about that.
Sanger’s work was driven largely by her experience as a maternity nurse. Abortion was illegal in the U.S. at the time, and she frequently saw young women die after attempting abortions themselves.
In 1914, Sanger fled to Europe to avoid a potential 45-year prison term for distributing information on birth control. The charges were later dropped.
After her return to the U.S., she and one of her sisters opened the birth control clinic in Brooklyn, above, for which she served a month in jail.
In the 1920s, she established the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Later in life, she was also instrumental in the development of the birth control pill.
Sanger has been criticized over her embrace of some principles of eugenics. But she is also remembered as an advocate for low-income women, arguing that access to contraceptive services through federal programs was especially crucial for them in retaining control over their reproductive lives.
