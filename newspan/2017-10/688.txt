Mr. Wieseltier did not immediately respond to a request for comment about specific allegations. But in an emailed statement on Tuesday, he offered an apology.
The new magazine project, titled Idea, was going to be something of a comeback for the 65-year-old Mr. Wieseltier, the former longtime literary editor of The New Republic and one of the most eloquently pugnacious survivors at a magazine as famous for its operatic internal office dramas as for its agenda-setting political journalism.
After Mr. Wieseltier’s departure from The New Republic, he landed on his feet, becoming the Isaiah Berlin senior fellow in culture and policy at the Brookings Institution as well as a contributing writer and critic at The Atlantic magazine. His friendship with Ms. Powell Jobs helped lead to Emerson Collective’s purchasing a majority stake in The Atlantic this past summer.
But it was perhaps the now-scuttled new magazine that exemplified both Mr. Wieseltier’s intellectual ambition and the loyal roster of high-powered collaborators he accumulated over the years. Contributors to the first issue consisted of longtime New Republic contributors, including the historian Timothy Snyder, the law professor and former Obama regulations czar Cass Sunstein, the foreign policy writer Robert Kagan and the dance historian Jennifer Homans.
It may have been bankrolled by a Silicon Valley fortune, but Mr. Wieseltier, who has often inveighed against the corrosive effects of technology on culture, described it as a throwback.
“The model is something like Partisan Review, circa 1955,” he said in an interview last year with the blog of the National Endowment of the Arts.
Now, it appears that no one will get to read it. In his statement, Mr. Wieseltier also offered an apology to his current collaborators, including a staff of a half dozen.
