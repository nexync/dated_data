LONDON — Delays in the construction of the Norman Foster-designed Zayed National Museum in Abu Dhabi means that an agreement with British Museum — which was to help curate exhibitions and lend the new institution around 500 valuable artifacts — is unlikely to be realized.
Although a report in The Art Newspaper on Saturday said that the British Museum and the Zayed National Museum had terminated their 10-year deal, signed in 2009, a spokeswoman from the British Museum said that the agreement had not ended, and that the contract would run until 2019. But since construction has not yet begun on the Zayed museum, the loan is unlikely to take place within the framework of the existing contact, the spokeswoman, Hannah Boulton, said.
The Zayed Museum, originally scheduled to open in 2013, is part of the Saadiyat island development that includes outposts of the Louvre and the Guggenheim. Under the original partnership agreement, the British Museum was to receive fees for the long-term loan of some of its holdings, which had not yet been formally specified.
The Zayed National Museum is named for Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the first president of the United Arab Emirates. On the Foster + Partners website, the project is marked 2020, and The Times reported that Mohamed Khalifa al-Mubarak, chairman of the Abu Dhabi’s culture and tourism bureau, said that construction of the Zayed Museum would go ahead.
“We’ve learned a lot from the building of the Louvre,” he said, referring to the Jean Nouvel-designed outpost of the Paris museum, which will open on Nov. 11. He added that the Zayed Museum will be built before the long-gestating Guggenheim that Frank Gehry is designing for Saadiyat Island.
