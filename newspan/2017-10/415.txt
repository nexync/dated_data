The designer Donna Karan has questioned whether women around the world are asking for “trouble” because of how they dress.
The comments came after the designer was asked about a New York Times investigation that found that the film producer Harvey Weinstein had been accused of sexually harassing employees and actresses for decades. Several powerful figures in the film industry who have worked with Mr. Weinstein, including Glenn Close, Kate Winslet and Judi Dench, condemned the Hollywood producer on Monday. He was fired by the Weinstein Company, the film production company he co-founded, on Sunday.
While Hollywood figures — mostly women — have begun speaking out about Mr. Weinstein’s behavior, the fashion world had remained largely silent until now.
Publicists for Ms. Karan released a statement on her behalf late Monday.
The actress Betsy Wolfe, the sports agent Ron Waxman and the actress Mia Farrow said they would no longer buy products associated with Ms. Karan’s name.
The G-III Apparel Group purchased Donna Karan International in 2016. Ms. Karan founded the fashion house named after her in 1984, and sold it to the French conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton in 2001. She stepped down from the helm of Donna Karan International in 2015 to focus on Urban Zen.
G-III also holds licenses for Ivanka Trump, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.
Some Twitter users posted images of clothing produced by Donna Karan International to ask if the manner of dress that Ms. Karan criticized on Sunday was one she had contributed to and perpetuated in her work. “To @dkny How many seventeen year olds have you dressed like they are, in your words, ‘asking for it’ ?” wrote the television host and author Anthony Bourdain.
