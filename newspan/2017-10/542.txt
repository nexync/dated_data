Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo vetoed a bill on Monday that would have legalized a classification of pocketknives known as gravity knives, which are currently illegal under a law that advocates say is disproportionately used against minorities.
It was the second straight year that the New York State Legislature had overwhelmingly approved such a measure, only to have it stopped at the governor’s desk.
The current law, instituted in 1958, bans knives that can be opened with the flick of a wrist. Such knives, sometimes used by professionals like construction workers and electricians, can be routinely bought without identification at hardware and sporting goods stores.
“In so doing, the Legislature has gone far beyond the innocent laborers carrying these knives for legitimate purposes and has grossly disregarded the concerns of law enforcement,” he wrote.
But advocates say a legislative change is urgent because the laws are more frequently applied to minorities, primarily in Manhattan. The Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit organization that represents low-income New Yorkers, said 84 percent of its clients prosecuted for gravity knife possession between July 1, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2015, were black or Hispanic. About 5,000 New Yorkers are arrested per year on charges related to carrying pocketknives, the organization said.
But the offices of Mayor Bill de Blasio and Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, were among those applauding the decision. Mr. Vance’s office has argued that it dismisses the cases of people who have the knives for professional reasons, and that the proposed bill would have legalized more dangerous knives.
“Blades which can be surreptitiously flicked open with one hand are dangerous weapons that do not belong on city streets and subways,” said Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Mr. Vance.
Advocates pledged to try again to get a similar measure enacted next year.
