LONDON — Regulators in Guernsey and in Singapore have opened an inquiry into Standard Chartered over the transfer of about $1.4 billion by clients with links to the Indonesian military.
Standard Chartered, which is based in London but does most of its business in Asia, conducted an internal review of the transactions and self-reported them to regulators, a person with knowledge of the investigation who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly said on Friday.
The Guernsey Financial Services Commission and the Monetary Authority of Singapore are investigating the transfer, a potential blow to Standard Chartered’s reputation as it tries to turn around its prospects under William T. Winters, the chief executive.
Since joining the bank in 2015, Mr. Winters has hired additional workers for the compliance division and bolstered efforts to identify financial crimes.
The transfer of funds to Singapore from accounts in Guernsey in the second half of 2015, first reported by Bloomberg News, came before Guernsey moved to comply with stricter disclosure requirements meant to increase transparency. The links to the Indonesian military also raised flags, the person with knowledge of the investigation said.
Standard Chartered ceased operations last year in Guernsey, a British dependency with financial and political autonomy. Guernsey and other Channel Islands have long been used as offshore tax havens.
The bank declined to comment on Friday. The Singapore Monetary Authority and the Guernsey Financial Services Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
