Mr. Trudeau acknowledged that Canada had not been spared the anti-immigrant sentiment and violence found elsewhere in the world. But he noted that after episodes like a shooting at a mosque in the city of Quebec in January, large numbers of Canadians have denounced the violence.
“We’re not some magical place immune to the forces we’ve seen,” Mr. Trudeau said. But he suggested that intolerance was not a defining characteristic of the country. “Where Canada has always done well is recognizing that diversity is a source of strength,” the prime minister said.
He’s Not Watching Twitter at 2 a.m.
Mr. Trudeau was an early and prominent user of social media among Canadian politicians. But he said that since becoming prime minister, he has backed away and now prefers to deal directly with Canadians at town hall-style meetings. While staff members monitor Mr. Trump’s tweets, Mr. Trudeau said they were not a critical element of policy making, nor are the president’s posts treated as a drop-everything priority.
“If I get woken up at night for something, it’d better be more important than a tweet — by anyone,” he said.
