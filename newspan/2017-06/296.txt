Daniel H. Weiss, who this month became the top official at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has sold a book about America’s experience in the Vietnam era to PublicAffairs, Mr. Weiss confirmed on Monday.
“Having an intellectual life is important to me,” he said in a telephone interview.
The book, “In That Time: A Story of Loss and Reconciliation in the Era of Vietnam,” focuses on Maj. Michael Davis O’Donnell, a helicopter pilot in Vietnam whose 1970 poem — written just two months before he was shot down on a rescue mission in Cambodia — has become an important artifact from the war and is featured on the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
