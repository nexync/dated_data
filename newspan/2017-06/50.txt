A sense of foreboding occurred to me as I read your article. The British government’s drive to “free businesses from the burden of safety regulations,” promises by politicians to cut red tape and a “gross failure of government oversight” are cited as a preliminary cause of this tragedy. This sounds all too familiar as I read about the deregulation under consideration by our own administration.
Industries in the United States as diverse as construction, transportation, finance, manufacturing and others will be adversely affected by deregulation, as most of us come to depend on safety measures for protection.
The duty of our elected officials is to do everything in their power to act responsibly and protect and preserve the safety of citizens in this country. Reducing or removing safety regulations and red tape does not cut it.
