When you make a fool of yourself for her. Even three decades later.
Dr. Mehmet Oz and his wife, Lisa, have been together for more than 30 years — and they’re still in love. Their secret?
A couple of years ago, Ms. Oz, who is editor at large of the Dr. Oz the Good Life magazine, told him she didn’t want material gifts anymore. She wanted him to make her stuff on Christmas, her birthday, Valentine’s Day. “Anything,” she said. At first, he got stressed; it’s much easier to pick out something in a store. Instead, he started writing her poetry, not an easy feat, he said, when you are not a natural poet. Sometimes they rhyme. Sometimes they don’t. He isn’t sure how good they are. But he does it for her.
We would like to hear about the moment you knew — and how you knew — that you were in love. Share your story with us here.
