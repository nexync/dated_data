On Monday evening, passengers were stranded without power between the West 4th Street and Broadway-Lafayette Street stations, a 45-minute ordeal in which the cars became overheated, causing some riders to panic and one woman to strip nearly naked as they waited in the dark to be rescued, passengers said.
Adding to the anxiety, passengers said, was a long pause with no announcement from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority about the cause. Mr. Sciaraffo said the first announcement said their train was held up by traffic delays.
“Then we got word that the train broke down,” he said. “How could you lie to us and keep us like this, uninformed?” he asked, referring to the transit agency. “That’s when it really turned up, people started getting anxiety, claustrophobia.” He said a woman in his car removed her shirt and pants to avoid overheating, and other passengers shielded her with their coats for privacy.
A train supervisor arrived at the southbound F train at about 6:30 p.m., 10 minutes after the power went out, and entered the rear of the train, Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for the transit agency, wrote by email. At that time, riders were informed that the train “was unable to take power,” Mr. Ortiz said.
About 6:45 p.m., the train was recharged and was able to inch into the Broadway-Lafayette station. The train operator was instructed to pull the front of the train past the station platform so that the train behind it could enter and let passengers off, Mr. Ortiz said, explaining why the doors on the first train could not immediately open.
The doors on the train “were opened within five minutes of pulling into the station, and customers were discharged” about 7:05 p.m., he said. The first announcement to customers by the train crew is under review, he added.
Videos posted on social media by passengers waiting on the platform captured fingers shooting through the rubber strips between the train doors. When the doors opened, the sweaty passengers escaped.
