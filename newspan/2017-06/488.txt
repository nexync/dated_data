SACRAMENTO — Keni Harrison, the world-record holder in the 100-meter hurdles, used a strong start to win her first United States outdoor track and field championship on Saturday. Nia Ali, the silver medalist at last year’s Olympics, was second, and Christina Manning took third.
The national meet is the qualifying event for the world championships, which are to be held in London in August. Harrison already had a wild-card berth for worlds, so Saturday’s fourth-place finisher, Dawn Harper-Nelson, also made the American team. Harper-Nelson was the 2008 Olympic gold medalist.
Harrison, who was disqualified at the 2015 worlds for a false start in the semifinals, finished in 12.60 seconds to beat Ali by eight-hundredths of a second.
Harrison did not make the team for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where the United States’ 1-2-3 hurdles finish was led by Brianna Rollins.
Rollins, who did not race on Saturday, is serving a one-year suspension for repeated failures to disclose her whereabouts to antidoping officials. Also missing from worlds will be Kristi Castlin, the bronze medalist in Rio, who finished sixth in the final.
In the pole vault, Sam Kendricks became a member of the 6-meter club on his way to winning.
The Olympic gold medalist Matthew Centrowitz was caught just before the finish of the 1,500 meters as Robby Andrews raced to his first national title. With a time of 3 minutes 43.29 seconds, he was just ahead of Centrowitz, who finished in 3:43.41.
In the 400 meters, Quanera Hayes won the women’s race in 49.72 seconds, and Fred Kerley of Texas A&M held off Gil Roberts to win the men’s in 44.03.
