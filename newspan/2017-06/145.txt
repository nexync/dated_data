A political drama that sketches a dark vision of an America in recovery after the imagined impeachment of President Trump will close its New York production on Sunday — about a month before the play’s producers originally intended, according to the producer, Jeffrey Richards.
The Off Broadway play, “Building the Wall,” was scheduled to run through July 9, according to a news release announcing the premiere.
Robert Schenkkan, the play’s author, said on Twitter that its “final performances” would be this weekend.
Final performances this weekend for @BLDGtheWallNYC off-Bway at New @newworldstages! 
The two-character piece, which is slated to be produced at various theaters around the country, made its New York premiere on May 12 and officially opened May 24.
Mr. Schenkkan has won a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award for his work. The Tony was for “All the Way,” his examination of the first year of Lyndon B. Johnson’s presidency, which starred Bryan Cranston on Broadway in 2014.
Mr. Richards said the vast majority of the new play’s reviews were favorable, but noted that a few — including one from The New York Times’s Jesse Green — were not.
In “Building the Wall,” Gloria, a history professor, interviews a former security officer named Rick in 2019. Mr. Trump has been exiled after a terrorist event prompted him to declare martial law and place Muslims and Mexicans and other groups in containment camps, which devolve into killing chambers. Rick, one of the men who helped carry out the atrocities, is in prison and Gloria has offered to tell his story.
Mr. Richards said the play was recently extended for a third time in Los Angeles, adding that the production is in rehearsal in Chicago; Tucson; Miami; and Santa Fe, N.M. Productions are also scheduled for Austria, Canada, Iran and Mexico, he said.
