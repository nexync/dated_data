• Congressman is hit in multiple shooting.
Representative Steve Scalise, the House majority whip, was among five people shot in Alexandria, Va., this morning at a practice session of a Republican congressional baseball team.
President Trump said the shooter, a 66-year-old Illinois man named James Hodgkinson, had died after being shot at the scene.
Mr. Hodgkinson, his brother said, had been distraught over the election of Mr. Trump.
Here’s what we know and don’t know on this developing story.
During a Senate hearing on Tuesday that was often contentious, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rejected the suggestion that he might have colluded with a Russian effort to disrupt the 2016 election. And he repeatedly refused to discuss conversations with President Trump.
Here are highlights from the testimony, in which Mr. Sessions cast his recusal from Russia-related investigations as a procedural matter, not the product of any wrongdoing.
Our Justice Department reporter answered readers’ questions, and we collected reactions from across the political spectrum.

One hundred and forty-one years ago this month, Edward Alexander Bouchet made history by becoming the first African-American to earn a doctorate from an American university.
He received his doctorate in physics at Yale University in June 1876.
He was the sixth person of any race to receive a doctorate in physics in the nation (but was not, as once thought, Yale’s first African-American graduate).
Dr. Bouchet was born in 1852 in New Haven, Conn. His father, a deacon who migrated north from South Carolina, worked as a valet for a judge.
During his time at Yale, Dr. Bouchet researched optics and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa Society. After earning the doctorate, Dr. Bouchet taught chemistry and physics at the School for Colored Youth, a Quaker institution in Philadelphia, for 26 years.
Today, the Bouchet Society, founded at Yale and Howard universities, recognizes scholarly achievement and promotes diversity and excellence in doctoral education.
This year, a plaque honoring Dr. Bouchet was unveiled on the Yale campus.
