Have Your Grandparents Told You About ‘Good Witch’?
For most of May, the No. 1 scripted show on cable (in three-day ratings) was AMC’s “Breaking Bad” spinoff, “Better Call Saul,” a prime example of critically hailed, auteur-era, certifiably binge-worthy television.
Cassie’s witchcraft is mild and undefined. At her New Agey gift store, Bell, Book & Candle — a homage to the 1958 film in which Kim Novak, starring alongside her “Vertigo” co-star Jimmy Stewart for the second time that year, played a well-intentioned witch — she knows just which tea or lotion will help a customer through a minor life crisis. Her real gift is an uncanny intuition she uses to nudge people toward the right path.
What’s most striking about the show — especially if you’re inclined to think that the age of its audience also implies a conservative cultural or political cast — is how thoroughly dominated it is by women. That isn’t necessarily unusual for a prime-time soap, but men in “Good Witch” are a particularly clueless and ineffectual bunch.
That focus on women is either undercut or reinforced, depending on your point of view, by the show’s corresponding focus on the mechanics of (chaste) romance. Cassie’s magic is most often used for matchmaking, and the show’s larger drama this season revolves around her own relationship with her prickly next-door neighbor, Sam (James Denton); an entire episode was devoted to whether he’d finally be able to tell her he loved her.
Men in “Good Witch” aren’t judged by their ability to orchestrate scams or kill zombies — they’re judged by whether they can be trusted to tell a woman the truth, and whether they try hard enough to make her happy. Binge-worthy or not, it’s a refreshing sentiment.
