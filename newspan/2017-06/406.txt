The Allergy & Asthma Network is concerned about the recent Legionnaires’ disease outbreak. People with asthma, allergies and lung diseases are more at risk for the disease, and we are deeply troubled that the New York City Department of Health is again pursuing a narrow investigation focusing exclusively on cooling towers.
We urge the Health Department to broaden its scope and begin comprehensive testing, including testing water in patients’ homes, places of work and the water distribution system.
While cooling towers — like all fixtures that use public water — should be investigated after any outbreak, in most cases cooling towers are not the source (56 percent of outbreaks studied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified drinking water systems).
It’s more likely that there are multiple transmission points seeded by one contaminated water supply. We encourage the Department of Health to conduct a comprehensive investigation to protect the public against this growing yet preventable disease.
