What Is FilmStruck, and Should I Subscribe?
Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.
For movie fans with a taste for international cinema, indie movies or film classics, the current streaming landscape can be frustrating. There is a place for you, though. It’s called FilmStruck, and here’s a quick guide to the streaming service, which is tailor-made for cinephiles.
O.K., So What Is FilmStruck?
A joint venture between the Criterion Collection and Turner Classic Movies, FilmStruck offers a curated rotation of movies: domestic rarities; hard-to-find international titles; or those films already in the Criterion Collection, which were previously available on Hulu (and on Netflix years before that). Although Turner Classic Movies is behind the service, most of its black-and-white American classics are not on FilmStruck; you still need a cable login to access those on TCM’s streaming site. Still FilmStruck’s collection always has something new to watch, with a constantly evolving library of movies, special features and themed bundles that focus on specific directors, actors or topics since the service debuted in November.
But not all of the movies in the Criterion Collection are available to stream on FilmStruck, and titles expire just as they do on Netflix and Amazon Prime. You can track which FilmStruck films are expiring on this page.
And What Movies Are Available?
First, know that you have two options when signing up for the service: No. 1, the basic FilmStruck package; and No. 2, the Criterion Channel. The first is required, while the second is an optional add-on. On a given date, many titles available through the Criterion Channel aren’t available to FilmStruck-only subscribers.
Then there are the bonus features unique to the Criterion Channel. As film fans still invested in physical media know, one of the primary appeals of Criterion Collection DVDs and Blu-rays is the extra material — interviews with directors, actors and critics; trailers; shorts; and making-of documentaries. Likewise, movies in the Criterion Channel add-on often come with bonus features. For instance, after “Eraserhead” expired on FilmStruck, subscribers with the Criterion Channel add-on could still watch the film and access the related bonus features, including several of director David Lynch’s short films, an interview, the trailer and a documentary.

FilmStruck guides viewers through its catalog in part by presenting themed collections with names like “Italian Neo-Realism,” “Female Friendships,” “Cinematography by Néstor Almendros” or the films of “Agnès Varda.” Some of these bundles also include hosted introductions for added context — the way movies are presented in prime time on TCM.
All Right, What’s It Going to Cost?
The basic FilmStruck offering is $6.99 a month. FilmStruck with the Criterion Channel add-on will run you $10.99 a month. Die-hard cinephiles can pay the upfront cost of $99 for the year for both streaming options. If you’re unsure where to start, there’s a two week free trial available so you can test which plan is right for you.
How Do I Access FilmStruck?
You can stream FilmStruck through Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast or Roku streaming devices. You can also access FilmStruck through its website or on your mobile device by using its iOS or Android apps. For now, FilmStruck is only available in the United States and Puerto Rico.
What Are Some Films I Should Start With?
Well, almost everything on the site is worth watching, so there’s a lot to choose from.
If you’re new to the Criterion Collection, hitting big name classic movies like “The Seven Samurai,” “The Red Shoes” or “Breathless” should be high on your list. Another good starting point is the “Now Playing” page, where you can explore the various theme collections available, like a this one looking at the work of Indian director Satyajit Ray, or this one on the topic of children in film.
If you have the Criterion Channel, there’s much more to dig into for each movie. For example, the “12 Angry Men” package includes the 50-minute television version and an interview with director Sidney Lumet. “The Essential Jacques Demy” includes several of his movies and shorts, as well as a documentary by his wife, Agnès Varda and a video essay. Don’t forget to keep an eye on the titles coming to or leaving FilmStruck.
