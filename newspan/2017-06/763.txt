Re “Is Pride Still for Queer People Like Me?,” by Krista Burton (Sunday Review, June 18): I invite Ms. Burton and others to attend Pride in a small city and to be reminded why Pride still matters.
My partner of 13 years and wife of almost 10 years and I attended Pride in Lansing, Mich., on Saturday. Our marriage was recognized in Michigan only after the 2015 Obergefell ruling, even though we were married in California in 2008 right before Proposition 8 passed.
On Thursday, we made signs with our 2-year-old daughter at our church, where we met a couple of 26 years who were able to get married only two years ago. We met another woman who was attending her first Pride ever because she just retired and only now doesn’t fear being outed at Pride and fired from her job.
As we marched with our people and straight allies, we were harassed by protesters who were right in our faces. We marched because my partner still had to adopt our daughter. We marched because our marriage was finally recognized where we live.
Pride matters to all the people fighting for protections that still aren’t guaranteed to all L.G.B.T.Q. people in our state.
As a gay man who came of age about two decades before Krista Burton, I disagree with her separatist impulses toward Pride celebrations.
Our straight allies are not only wonderful, as she says, but also crucial. It is a joy to welcome them to celebrate successes they helped make possible. Indeed, Pride should open its arms to all who find it comforting, uplifting or empowering.
Where Ms. Burton sees only the cynical motives of corporate sponsors, their presence often reflects years of diversity work by activists inside those companies. While they did not sponsor Stonewall, their presence now testifies to our success over the forces that would have previously pilloried them.
