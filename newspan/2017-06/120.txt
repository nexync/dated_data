The Kitchen, 512 W 19th St.
Cynthia Hopkins starts her new show, “Articles of Faith,” with Einstein’s assertion that our entire outlook depends on whether we think of the universe as friendly or hostile.
You can see why this would be on Ms. Hopkins’s mind: In May 2015, this musician and performance artist lost all of her earthly possessions when her Williamsburg, Brooklyn, apartment — which doubled as work studio and tripled as storage space — went up in flames while she and her husband, the designer Jeff Sugg, were on vacation. Everything was gone: costumes and props, clothes, years’ worth of writing, furniture.
This would have been a crisis of epic proportions for anybody, and, of course, it was just that for Ms. Hopkins. But she’s also someone whose work is largely autobiographical — she explored her drinking in “The Alcoholic Movie Musical!” and her ailing father’s legacy in “The Truth: A Tragedy,” for instance — so the disaster inevitably led to a show.
Happily, it’s wonderful.
In the past, Ms. Hopkins has had a tendency to veer into self-indulgence and cutesiness, but “Articles of Faith,” which is having its premiere at the Kitchen as part of the Lumberyard in the City festival, avoids these twin perils. As usual, Ms. Hopkins is the sole performer, but she’s not the only voice recounting what happened before and after the fire, which was caused by an ancient power strip: Each of the show’s sections is presented in a different style.
Yet we never lose sight of Ms. Hopkins’s own distinct personality, a mixture of winking elfin charm, dry humor and confessional openness, as she guides us through, among many other topics, the physics of fire, why the burned-down apartment was a hellhole and what happened to her cats.
Part memoir, part tribute, part philosophical essay, “Articles of Faith” also acts as a public service announcement: After hearing what happened to Ms. Hopkins, you’re guaranteed to double-check your surge protectors after getting home.
