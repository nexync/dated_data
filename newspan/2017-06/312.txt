If you are curious about Sarah Jessica Parker’s literary diet, you might look more closely at her onscreen surroundings for clues. The actress tends to hide the books she’s reading on set: in the bag her character is holding or under a couch cushion in her fictional home. That quirk is now reflected in her new job: editorial director of her own imprint, SJP for Hogarth.
The job was offered to her by Molly Stern, the head of Hogarth, whom Ms. Parker met at a luncheon in 2013; the two subsequently founded a book club that reads almost exclusively unpublished works early. Since launching the imprint last fall, Ms. Parker has read a dozen or more submissions. Today, it was announced that she has acquired her first manuscript, a debut novel by Fatima Farheen Mirza, a graduate of the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. The novel, tentatively titled “A Place for Us,” follows an Indian-American family that is reunited on the eve of the eldest daughter, Hadia’s, wedding. It tackles issues of belonging and tradition, delving into the complex experience of an immigrant family in the United States.
But reading and libraries are “my life’s great pleasure,” she says. She is also partnering with the American Library Association on their Book Club Central initiative and will recommend four books per year to be featured on the platform. Her first pick, “No One Is Coming to Save Us,” by Stephanie Powell Watts, was announced on Saturday.
Julie Todaro, president of the American Library Association, hopes the partnership will remind people of librarians’ expertise. “We want to have people use us throughout their lives to either inform or do research or to create a future for themselves,” she says.
As Ms. Parker continues the search for her other acquisitions, she expresses some trepidation about the editing process; she’s afraid a writer might be “allergic” to her feedback.
