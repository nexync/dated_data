WASHINGTON — President Trump will travel to Paris for Bastille Day next month at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron, White House officials said on Wednesday.
The statement said Mr. Trump would use the July 14 visit to celebrate the French National Day and to mark the 100th anniversary of the entry of the United States into World War I.
“President Trump looks forward to reaffirming America’s strong ties of friendship with France,” the statement said.
But the visit could be contentious, given the history, however short, between the two leaders. During their first meeting in Brussels last month, their prolonged, tightly gripped handshake suggested a tense relationship.
Mr. Trump was open about his enthusiasm for Mr. Macron’s opponent in the recent French presidential elections. And Mr. Macron was openly derisive of the American president’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate accords.
Mr. Macron coined the expression “Make our planet great again” to tweak Mr. Trump over the climate decision. And in a speech after Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal, Mr. Macron all but urged Americans to move to France.
“I call on them: Come and work here with us — to work together on concrete solutions for our climate, our environment. I can assure you, France will not give up the fight,” he said.
