OAKLAND, Calif. — Commissioner Adam Silver wants the N.B.A.’s draft-eligibility rules changed.
Less than a month away from a draft in which about 20 players who completed just one year of college are expected to be selected, Silver thinks the so-called “one-and-done” rule will be modified — somehow — before too long. But Silver also acknowledged that even he wasn’t certain what would make the most sense as a replacement.
It’s been just over a decade since the N.B.A. and the players’ union agreed on a rule that says players either need to be 19 years old or be one year removed from high school before being eligible for the draft. There are arguments for raising the minimum age to 20, as well as arguments for getting rid of the rule altogether.
Silver also defended the N.B.A.’s decision to return the All-Star Game to Charlotte, N.C., in 2019, after taking it away and moving it to New Orleans this season in response to North Carolina’s law restricting the rights and anti-discrimination protections for L.G.B.T. people.
