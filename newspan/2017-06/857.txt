I wanted to provide you with an unsophisticated synopsis of The New York Times and the media’s quest for the implosion of Donald Trump’s presidency from out here in the real world, in “deplorable” country.
As you can imagine (or maybe you can’t quite), as a proud deplorable, I have many associates, colleagues and relatives who agree with me. Every time you and your brethren at other news organizations dream up a new scheme to get Mr. Trump, we out here in deplorable land increase our support for him.
It’s quite humorous that when The Times, The Washington Post and the networks all bash Mr. Trump, our support increases.  And even more humorously, there isn’t anything you can do about it!
And I love it that you are having the exact opposite effect on those of us you are trying to persuade to think otherwise. I mean it is seriously an enjoyable part of my day knowing you are failing. And badly!
I haven’t had this much fun watching the media stumble, bumble and fumble in years. I wonder what will happen on the day you wake up and realize how disconnected you’ve become?
