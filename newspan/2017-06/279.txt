The film also speaks with food journalists (including Michael Pollan, a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine) as well as farmers who have benefited from the technology. And if trust is an issue, Neil deGrasse Tyson, perhaps the most credible public scientist on the planet, is its narrator.
The food industry recruits scientists to speak on its behalf, but in press notes and email correspondence, the film’s producers say no funding came from any Big Ag company or lobbying group. “Food Evolution” was commissioned by the nonprofit Institute of Food Technologists, and the filmmakers retained creative control.
