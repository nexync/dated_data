From Jim Shepard’s “The World to Come” (Knopf, 2017, Page 102). Shepard’s stories are set in a remarkable variety of times and nations; “The World to Come” is his fifth collection.
This sentence occurs in the middle of a short story but is basically its own little devastating poem: the ecology of an estranged marriage. The narrator is a 19th-century farmer’s wife who has fallen in love with another farmer’s wife — a love that is brutally denied by the men involved. Her sentence feels, in its elemental simplicity, like something from feudal Japan. Its opening clause posits an almost mathematical balance between the social and the natural world — “my heart : him :: pond : crane.” And yet that precision describes a situation of deep, unsolvable human sadness. The narrator’s heart-pond is destined to remain terminally neglected, its depths unexplored, its most precious resources unconsumed.
What is especially touching here is her empathy, in spite of all that sadness. She gives us a remarkably intimate portrait of failed intimacy. The image of husband-as-crane is surprisingly generous. A crane is not a powerful, violent, blundering intruder. It is skinny and awkward; it probes the shoreline delicately. It is a predator, yes, but also helpless, ridiculous and completely at the mercy of the life in the pond.
Most of all, the crane belongs exactly where it is. It is not doing anything wrong in this situation; it is only being a crane. The pond, likewise, is only being a pond. Neither can help the other. Everyone involved is performing their role to perfection. The ecosystem is locked in an unhappy stasis. And therefore the situation will never improve.
