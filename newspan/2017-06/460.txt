High Times, the magazine that has chronicled the transformation of marijuana use from an underground vice to a major American business, said on Thursday that it had been acquired by a group of investors that includes Damian Marley, son of the reggae star Bob Marley.
The group, led by Adam Levin, the founder of the investment firm Oreva Capital, bought a controlling interest at a price that values the magazine at $70 million, according to The San Francisco Chronicle.
In a news release, the new ownership group said it planned to expand the publication’s audience and its events business.
The magazine was founded in 1974 by Tom Forcade as a subversive record of the marijuana counterculture. Whereas Playboy centerfolds displayed buxom women, High Times centerfolds displayed beautiful buds. It offered how-to instructions for growing at home, and even advice on best practices for smuggling marijuana.
Cannabusiness is booming. In November, voters in California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada decided through ballot measures to legalize recreational use, joining Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington. More than 20 percent of Americans now live in states where marijuana use is legal.
A CBS News poll in April showed that 61 percent of Americans supported legalization. President Trump has said that he is “in favor of medical marijuana 100 percent” and that the issue should be left to the states.
The company said it had 236,000 monthly print subscribers and a digital audience of more than 20 million unique visitors a month. But much of its revenue comes from events like the Cannabis Cup, a trade show that began in 1988 and has expanded to multiple locations.
