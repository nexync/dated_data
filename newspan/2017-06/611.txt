Anyone who’s been longing for a return to Middle-earth is in luck.
On Thursday, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt released a new illustrated book that draws on the archives of J.R.R. Tolkien, the author of “The Lord of the Rings” fantasy epic and its predecessor, “The Hobbit.” The new book, “Beren and Lúthien,” was compiled and edited by Christopher Tolkien, the third son of the author.
“In my ninety-third year this is (presumptively) my last book in the long series of editions of my father’s writings, very largely previously unpublished, and is of a somewhat curious nature,” Mr. Tolkien writes in the preface to the new book.
The story of the romantic protagonists, who are mentioned in the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, grew deeper and richer over the years as Tolkien returned to their tale in both poetry and prose. The new book attempts to distill the story of their relationship from the volumes of “The History of Middle-earth” where, as Christopher Tolkien remarks in the preface, it can be difficult to follow.
The 288-page book includes drawings by Alan Lee, an illustrator who has worked on past books written by Mr. Tolkien and won an Academy Award in 2004 for his work on “The Return of the King,” the third film in the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. The book arrives a decade after “The Children of Húrin,” the last book about Middle-earth released by the author’s estate, which topped the New York Times best-seller list despite its recycled contents.
According to a blog post on the website of the Tolkien Society, the publication of “Beren and Lúthien” comes almost exactly 100 years after a memorable encounter between the author and his wife, Edith, one which the author later described to his son as an inspiration for the story of the human and the elf. The Oxford gravestone shared by J.R.R. and Edith Tolkien includes the names Beren and Lúthien.
