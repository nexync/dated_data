Today is Bloomsday, a special day on the literary calendar.
James Joyce, the groundbreaking Irish novelist chose to immortalize June 16, 1904, in his novel “Ulysses” because it was the date of his first outing with his future wife, Nora Barnacle.
It is named after Leopold Bloom, whom the book follows on a daylong picaresque voyage through Dublin, Joyce’s hometown. More than a century later, the character’s “odyssey” is celebrated around the world with readings, re-enactments and, sometimes, heavy drinking.
But help is a tap away.
Have a great Bloomsday.
