RICH AND PRETTY, by Rumaan Alam. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $15.99.) Two longtime friends attempt to maintain their relationship, even as their lives sharply diverge in this debut novel. Sarah, the daughter of a wealthy family who works at a charity, is planning her wedding, while Lauren, single and adrift, bristles at her maid-of-honor expectations. The friendship is tested, in part by a surprise pregnancy and conflicting values.
WHO COOKED ADAM SMITH’S DINNER?: A STORY ABOUT WOMEN AND ECONOMICS, by Katrine Marçal. Translated by Saskia Vogel. (Pegasus, $15.95.) “Feminism has always been about economics,” Marçal, a Swedish journalist, writes in the prologue to this book. “Virginia Woolf wanted a room of her own, and that costs money.” In this lively analysis, she argues that economics (and economists) consistently devalue women’s contributions, in both the United States and Europe.
BEFORE WE VISIT THE GODDESS, by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. (Simon & Schuster, $15.99.) Three generations of unlucky women — from Bengal, India, to Houston — repair their connections to each other in this novel. Sabitri, a poor girl in a rural village, loses her chance to seek an education after a fateful mistake. Years later, her daughter, Bela, tries to make a new life in the United States; when plans go awry, they have lasting consequences for her own child, Tara.
DINNER WITH EDWARD: A STORY OF AN UNEXPECTED FRIENDSHIP, by Isabel Vincent. (Algonquin, $14.95.) When Vincent, a journalist for The New York Post, arrived in New York, she faced an unwelcoming city and an unraveling marriage. But she also met Edward, a widower in his 90s and her friend’s father, whose conversation — and sumptuous, home-cooked dinners — were a welcome contrast.
