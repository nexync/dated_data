In “The Pride of the Yankees,” Richard Sandomir tells the story behind what he calls “the first great sports film,” the 1942 movie starring Gary Cooper as the doomed Lou Gehrig.
Love it or hate it, most of us are familiar with prog rock, the brainy and meandering music of bands like Pink Floyd and Genesis (in the band’s early years), epitomized by songs like Yes’s “The Gates of Delirium,” a 21-minute epic inspired by “War and Peace.” But even those of us who scoff at the genre’s bloat and nerdy imagery probably enjoy some of its fruits.
David Weigel’s “The Show That Never Ends” is a new history of the genre written by an ardent, straight-faced defender who also understands what is most outlandishly entertaining about it. Like prog rock itself, the book doesn’t lack for ambition, beginning with Liszt and Stravinsky. Actually, that’s after a delightful introduction set on a “prog rock cruise” — an “easy subject for mockery,” as Weigel understatedly writes. One way it doesn’t resemble its subject is in its length: a tidy 300 pages or so.
