After 11 years as president of the James Beard Foundation, Susan Ungaro has announced that she will step down. Her term will end on Dec. 31, giving the foundation about six months to find a replacement.
Ms. Ungaro, 64, the former editor in chief of Family Circle magazine, took on the foundation job at a troubled time for the organization. After struggling to get off the ground at first, it had its credibility tarnished by a financial scandal that resulted in the imprisonment of its former board president, Leonard F. Pickell Jr., who stole more than $1 million in cash and unauthorized expenses from the group.
Under her leadership, the foundation’s reputation and its position in the culinary world rose as the group’s accolades for chefs and their participation in its programs became important career milestones. The organization’s annual income more than tripled to nearly $12 million, and for the 2016-17 fiscal year, it expects to report a surplus of $400,000.
Ms. Ungaro expanded the foundation’s awards program, securing high-end sponsors, engaging celebrity presenters, and moving the ceremonies to Lincoln Center and then recently to Chicago, a shift that was intended to create a sense that the foundation was not totally centered on New York, where it is based.
She inaugurated the foundation’s food summit, JBF Leadership Awards and programs to recognize women in the culinary field, among other initiatives. The foundation’s outreach to younger participants expanded under her administration, and its scholarships program grew.
The foundation will commemorate its 30th anniversary in November with celebrations that include a television special. Ms. Ungaro said she planned to remain involved with the organization after her departure.
