The episode took place on April 21 in Zhumadian, a city in the central province of Henan. The graphic video, which was posted online Wednesday, shows a woman trying to cross a street on a crosswalk during what appears to be a red light for pedestrians.
After crossing two lanes, she is struck by a taxi and tossed in the air before landing on the ground. Then the light turns green for pedestrians. People walk by but do not help, nor do the drivers who were stopped at the light. The woman lifts her head, but the traffic resumes and she is soon run over by an S.U.V. She later died from her injuries.
Some say the problem is a legal one. In 2006, a man in Nanjing who helped an injured woman get to a hospital was held financially responsible for her treatment on the grounds that he would only have helped if he were responsible. In addition, many Chinese are wary of helping because of numerous scams where people purport to be victims of an injury in order to extract compensation.
But many people reacted differently. The local police announced that more than a dozen people had called the emergency rescue number, and some had offered help to the victim’s family. The police also announced this week after the public outcry that the two drivers of the vehicles that hit the woman had been found. The police added that compensation had been paid to the victim’s family, but it was unclear who paid it.
Since coming to power in 2012, President Xi Jinping has made public morality a top priority. In addition to a better-known anticorruption campaign, the government has introduced a campaign to promote values, many of them traditional.
Some online commentators, however, said those efforts had not yet borne fruit.
Mr. Zhang, the lawyer, said that government policies are partly to blame. Although the government preaches morality, its actions often undermine that message.
