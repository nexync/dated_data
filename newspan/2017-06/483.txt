Q. Do M.R.I. scans cause any harm?
A. Magnetic resonance imaging, or M.R.I., is considered one of the safest technologies for looking deep inside the body, because it doesnâ€™t carry the radiation risk of X-rays or PET scans.
Some street clothes contain metal in unexpected places, like underwear and socks, which is why patients are usually asked to change into hospital gowns before an M.R.I., said Dr. David Hintenlang, a medical physicist in the radiology department at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center.
