‘A WORLD OF EMOTIONS: ANCIENT GREECE, 700 B.C.-200 A.D.’ at the Onassis Cultural Center (closes on June 24). We tend to think of the art of Classical Greece, with its buff Apollos and poised Aphrodites, as beyond perturbation. But this remarkable, free-admission show, made up largely of work from Greek museums, gives quite another view, of an art based on narratives driven by hatred, hubris, lust, grief and violence.
