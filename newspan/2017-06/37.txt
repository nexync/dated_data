Carrie Fisher tested positive for cocaine, methadone, ethanol and opiates when she was admitted to the hospital four days before her death in December, according to a toxicology report released on Monday by the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner.
But the coroner’s office said it could not determine the role of drugs in Ms. Fisher’s death, which it said last Friday was caused by sleep apnea and a combination of other factors, including heart disease.
Ms. Fisher, who gained worldwide fame for her portrayal of Princess Leia in the “Star Wars” franchise, was 60 years old when she died on Dec. 27 in Los Angeles after collapsing on a flight from London four days earlier. Her mother, the actress Debbie Reynolds, had a stroke and died the next day, at the age of 84.
Her daughter, the actress Billie Lourd, said in a statement to People magazine on Friday that her mother had always been open about her struggles with mental illness and substance abuse. Ms. Lourd said that she wanted people to talk about those parts of her mother’s life, too.
