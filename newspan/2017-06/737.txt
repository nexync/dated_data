BERLIN — One of Germany’s biggest rock festivals was set to resume, the organizers said on Saturday, a day after the police ordered tens of thousands of fans to leave because of an unspecified terrorist threat.
Fans had gathered on Friday night at the fabled Nürburgring racetrack complex in western Germany for a three-day rock festival, Rock am Ring, featuring some of the country’s top rock bands. About 60,000 people were at the site when organizers announced the shutdown, the police said.
But in a Facebook post on Saturday, organizers said they had been given the all-clear to reopen, according to reports.
The security arrangements at the festival had been overhauled in recent days, “with a view to the recent attack on a concert in Manchester,” the police said, referring to the bombing last month in Britain.
Earlier on Friday, German television showed police officers removing manhole covers and checking the festival premises with great care. The number of officers present was increased to 1,200, the police said.
“We are taking all tips and all suspicious circumstances very seriously,” the police statement said.
