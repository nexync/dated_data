She is the daughter of Janice C. Padden and J. Andrew Padden III of New London, N.H. The bride’s parents, who are retired, founded Sales Solutions, a Boston company that represents makers of health and safety equipment.
Mr. Kiely, 49, is the Robert H. Taylor curator and department head for literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York. He graduated with first-class honors and received a doctoral degree in English literature from the University of London. His previous marriage ended in divorce.
He is the son of Joan Ayres Kiely of Lydford, England, and the late John D. Kiely, who lived in Plymouth, England.

The couple met in 2007, when the bride attended a fund-raising event at the Morgan Library. Several years later, in 2012, the two reconnected when the bride asked Mr. Kiely to arrange a private tour for her mother of an exhibition at the library that had recently opened.
