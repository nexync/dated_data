A teacher at a Texas middle school is out of a job after she gave mock awards to students that included designations like “most likely to become a terrorist” and “most likely to blend in with white people,” the school district and local media reports said.
“We have concluded our investigation, and the teacher responsible is no longer employed by the district,” the Channelview Independent School District said in a one-sentence statement when asked on Wednesday to confirm reports that the teacher was no longer working at the school, in Channelview, near Houston.
A spokesman did not reply to questions about whether the teacher had been fired or had resigned.
The teacher was not named in the district statement, but the certificates were signed by Stacy Lockett, who handed out the “awards” last week as part of a ceremony to celebrate the end of the term at Anthony Aguirre Junior High.
Lizeth Villanueva, 13, a seventh grader in the teacher’s AVID program, which prepares advanced students for college, told KPRC television that her teacher “just laughed” when she signed and handed her the certificate printed with the words “most likely to become a terrorist” above her name.
“For that child to either be called a terrorist or she’s not black enough, basically now the students are taking that, and that’s her label for the rest of the school year,” said Sydney’s mother, Latonya Robinson.
Debbie Feinberg, a spokeswoman at AVID, which is based in San Diego, said the teacher was not an AVID employee. AVID is a nonprofit organization that offers its academic and social support to students to help them prepare for college.
Ms. Lockett could not be reached on Wednesday. KPRC also reported that other students had said they liked her as a teacher.
