The French Open is in full swing — and virtually every story about the tournament includes reference to a man who had little to do with tennis.
That’s Roland Garros, the French war hero after whom the tournament’s main Paris tennis stadium is named.
In 1913, he became the first person to fly across the Mediterranean. During World War I, he was a pioneer of air warfare, shooting down four enemy planes with a forward-firing machine gun that shot between the propeller blades.
Garros was killed when his plane was shot down on Oct. 5, 1918, a day before his 30th birthday.
A decade later, a tennis stadium was constructed in Paris by Emile Lesieur, who insisted it be named after Garros, his wartime friend.
