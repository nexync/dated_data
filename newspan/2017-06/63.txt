Tom Ford spring 2018 men’s collection.
Directly in front on him was a display of evening jackets: one in a Pucci-esque swirl of psychedelic greens, another in an electric shade of pink. A few models were circling the room, some outfitted for evening, one in an animal-print swimsuit small enough to ball up in your fist. It was 9 a.m.
Mr. Ford is returning to color. He had been in a neutral mood the past few seasons, but now color is back, often shown in the tone-on-tone style he prefers.
His clients, on the other hand, are open to the full range of possibilities, from the boardroom-restrained to the ballroom-fabulous. Whatever the style, it leans toward the lavish. Mr. Ford showed tennis shoes but also pool slide sandals, in velvet — an ornamental if not strictly functional touch, since velvet is a fabric you might want to keep at some distance from the pool.
For now, for men, there are the classics, dialed up. Mr. Ford makes a full wardrobe: suits (business, swim), casual wear, jeans, glasses, boots, shoes, 39 fragrances, with timepieces to come in the fall.
“There’s not really a thing for men we don’t make,” he said.
The grace note, underwear, will follow next spring. Soon, nothing will come between the man of means and his Toms.
