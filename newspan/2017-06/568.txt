In President Donald Trump’s transactional worldview, human rights are annoying obstacles to making deals.
That pretty much told every unsavory regime that it could imprison, abuse and even murder opponents with impunity as long as they were useful to the United States. Mr. Trump’s open admiration for a parade of autocrats — from the Philippines’ President Rodrigo Duterte to Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin — has driven home that point, as has the president’s recent trip to the Middle East.
Ms. Haley harshly criticized Venezuela, Cuba and Iran, but said the council had been too critical of Israel. She warned that unless the council ended in its attacks on Israel, and also reformed its bylaws to keep human rights violators from becoming members, the United States might leave the group and withdraw its funding.
That would be a mistake. The council’s voting system must be reformed, and others deserve more condemnation than Israel.
Yet despite the damage Mr. Trump has done, the world still hopes for the leadership on human rights that Ms. Haley is promising. Mr. Trump squanders this hope at the peril of the United States’ ability to shape institutions, even flawed ones, and uphold values that are the world’s only bulwark against tyranny.
