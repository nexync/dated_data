A wave of drug overdoses in Georgia has killed as many as four people and hospitalized dozens over two days, health officials said on Tuesday.
Christopher Hendry, the chief medical officer at Navicent Health, a hospital in Macon, said at a news conference that officials believed the spate of overdoses was linked to yellow pills that users bought on the street. He noted, however, that toxicology reports will not come back for a few more days, so the causes of the deaths have not been confirmed.
In a statement, the Georgia Department of Health said while the overdoses were reported in south and central Georgia, the drugs may also have been sold in other parts of the state.
David Davis, the sheriff of Bibb County, appealed to anyone who had information to help the authorities find the source of the overdoses. If anyone were concerned that they’d be in legal trouble by coming forward with information, “we’re going to let that pass,” Sheriff Davis said.
Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans under 50, and public health officials say the current opioid epidemic is the worst drug crisis in American history. Drug overdose deaths have increased more than 500 percent since 1990.
There were likely more than 59,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2016, the largest annual jump ever recorded, according to preliminary data. In 2015, there were more deaths from heroin alone than gun homicides.
