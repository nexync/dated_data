Jay Z may not have turned up for his induction as the first rapper in the Songwriters Hall of Fame, but he managed to make the most of it anyway.
At a ceremony on Thursday in Manhattan that featured the likes of Jon Bon Jovi, Berry Gordy, Ed Sheeran and Pitbull, this Brooklyn rapper, born Shawn Carter, was a presence even in absentia, noting the occasion with a microphone-drop of a video message from former President Barack Obama.
“I’m pretty sure I’m still the only president to listen to Jay Z’s music in the Oval Office,” Mr. Obama added, to whoops from the crowd.
Also inducted into the Hall of Fame this year: Kenneth Edmonds, best known as Babyface, who, in addition to his solo work, wrote songs for Whitney Houston and Boyz II Men; the R&B producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (Janet Jackson, Mary J. Blige); the Swedish pop mastermind Max Martin (Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Katy Perry); and the band Chicago’s chief songwriters, Robert Lamm, James Pankow and Peter Cetera. Mr. Gordy, the Motown founder, was honored as well, after deferring his induction last year.
While the songwriting award rarely resonates much beyond industry circles, Jay Z and his team had made plain in advance of the event how much the award meant to him, repeatedly highlighting the rapper’s induction as a significant occasion.
“To finally have somebody in this culture — in this part of the game, this side — recognized, it’s long overdue, but I’m glad it’s him,” said Chance the Rapper in his video message, highlighting Jay Z’s focus over the years on encouraging artists to retain control over their publishing rights and master recordings.
