Dave Chappelle is setting up shop at Radio City Music Hall this summer.
On Monday, the comedian announced a 10-show residency at the Manhattan venue, featuring an array of special guests from the worlds of comedy and music.
Other boldface names enlisted for the August run include: Chris Rock (Aug. 5); Trevor Noah, the host of “The Daily Show” (Aug. 18); Childish Gambino, the musical alter ego of the actor, director and writer Donald Glover (Aug. 19); and the comedian Ali Wong (Aug. 24). The Aug. 15 show teases only a “very special guest.” Tickets go on sale Friday at chappelleradiocity.com.
The shows come at an especially lively time for Mr. Chappelle, who largely avoided the spotlight for years after leaving behind his sketch comedy program, “Chappelle’s Show,” in 2005. In March, he released two stand-up specials (“Deep in the Heart of Texas” and “The Age of Spin”) on Netflix, with a third planned for release on the platform this year. A previous 10-show run at Radio City helped to kick-start Mr. Chappelle’s mainstream comeback in 2014.
