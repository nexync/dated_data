He is leaving a fixer-upper on the Upper West Side of Manhattan for a sleek new home in Hamburg, Germany. Alan Gilbert, the departing music director of the New York Philharmonic, announced Friday that he would be the next chief conductor of the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra, whose striking new $843 million concert hall overlooking Hamburg’s harbor opened earlier this year.
With the move, Mr. Gilbert is leaving behind the Philharmonic as it labors to jump-start the long-delayed renovation of its Lincoln Center home, David Geffen Hall — and moving to a city whose gleaming new hall has been capturing the imagination of audiences.
And he is returning to musicians who know him well: Mr. Gilbert was the ensemble’s principal guest conductor from 2004 to 2015, when it was known as the NDR Symphony Orchestra (it renamed itself for its new hall, where it took up residency in January). In a recent interview, before he had accepted the post, Mr. Gilbert spoke of his admiration for the way the Elbphilharmonie had worked to build a relationship with its audience prior to the hall’s opening.
The orchestra is well respected, but has never been in the front ranks of German orchestras — an august group that includes the Berlin Philharmonic, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the Dresden Staatskapelle and Munich’s orchestras. But Hamburg has been making a big investment in music, and officials there said they were pleased to have landed a musician of Mr. Gilbert’s stature — and one with clear ideas about innovation.
“His vision for a 21st-century orchestra is a perfect fit for the Elbphilharmonie,” Christoph Lieben-Seutter, the general and artistic director of the Elbphilharmonie, said in a statement. Mr. Gilbert agreed to a five-year contract, starting in the 2019-20 season.
In interviews last month, Mr. Gilbert suggested that he would take on a new permanent position with an orchestra only if he felt sure that all the powers that be were in sync.
