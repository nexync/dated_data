Jacob’s Pillow, the annual summer dance festival in Becket, Mass., is planning to extend its reach through year-round residencies for choreographers and other initiatives.
The new programs, called Vision ’22, are the first major project undertaken by the festival’s leader, Pamela Tatge, who was hired last year and is presenting her first season this summer. The plans were announced at the Pillow’s 85th anniversary gala performance on Saturday night.
The choreographic residency program, which previously took place only during the off-season, has now expanded to the whole year and is expected to bring in 10 to 15 dancemakers.
At the gala on Saturday, the New York City Ballet principal dancer Sara Mearns performed the result of one such residency, with the contemporary dance duo Honji Wang and Sébastien Ramirez. (This was Ms. Mearns’s second residency at Jacob’s Pillow; she worked there with the choreographer Jodi Melnick two summers ago.) Over the course of two weeks, they created a roughly 13-minute work.
The other major arms of Vision ’22 include community engagement and bringing the Pillow’s artists into local schools, as well as a plan to renovate the campus, 36 buildings on 220 acres in the Berkshires.
