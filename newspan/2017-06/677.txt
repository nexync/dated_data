Given the yearslong lag time from car design to production, security researchers are also concerned about the shelf life of software deeply embedded in a car, which may no longer be supported, or patched, by the time the car makes it out of the lot.
In 2014, for example, some curious Tesla Model S owners did some tinkering and claimed to have discovered a customized version of a type of Linux software called Ubuntu. Ubuntu 10.10 was first released in October 2010 and has not been supported since December 2014. “In effect, that means the operating system in your car was deprecated before you bought it,” Mr. Rogers said.
And automakers stitch together software from dozens of different suppliers, all of them with different shelf lives and patch cycles. If automakers have any chance of keeping cars secure, figuring out a secure way to roll out patches to every car remotely, for different software components, will be a problem that even the software industry itself has not totally figured out.
Discussions are ongoing about which government body — the Federal Trade Commission, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or another body — will ultimately govern the cybersecurity of connected and autonomous cars.
For now, a number of private organizations are hosting discussions among automakers, identifying and cataloging common security threats.
