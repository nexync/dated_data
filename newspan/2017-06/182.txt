• President Trump took his harshest shot yet against James Comey, his former F.B.I. director, calling him “cowardly” and accusing him of leaking sensitive information, in an early morning Twitter blast.
The U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, told Congress that he would testify on Tuesday about issues related to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election.
Immigration experts, meanwhile, say the Trump administration has done little to respond to legal challenges to the White House’s initial and revised travel bans — and there have been few changes to the vetting of people trying to get into the United States.
• In France, the party of President Emmanuel Macron appears to be cruising to victory in the first round of voting for representatives to the powerful lower house of the French Parliament.

The staging was powerful: A U.S. president stood behind panels of bulletproof glass near the Berlin Wall at the height of the Cold War.
The wall — which had divided the German capital since 1961 — was a physical and metaphorical symbol of the ideological and economic differences that separated East and West.
The effects of Reagan’s speech have since been debated. Political commentators and historians noted that it received relatively little news media coverage at the time. Initial drafts met resistance within the White House, and the call to tear down the wall did not appear until later versions.
But this much is certain: A little more than two years later, on Nov. 9, 1989, East and West Germans began dismantling the wall.
