Cast members and producers of the ABC reality show “Bachelor in Paradise” were sent home last week after accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior on the set.
Though Warner Bros. and ABC have not divulged more information, the accusation centered on sexual misconduct, according to a person familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing.
“The Bachelor in Paradise” is a spinoff featuring former love-seeking contestants on “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” who are brought together in a tropical setting, where plenty of alcohol is provided and intimate physical contact is encouraged. The show’s fourth season was scheduled to air in ABC in August but that seems unlikely now. Whether the show will return at all is unknown.
It is rare to suspend production of a reality show and send cast members home, especially one that is part of ABC’s prominent “Bachelor” franchise, which has enjoyed a recent hot streak. “The Bachelor” was the only show on the broadcast networks that saw its ratings grow in the most recent TV season.
But this latest episode underscores how reality shows, which need high drama and characters with outsize personalities, can also wade into gravely serious territory. While reality show producers often want to push the limits in regards to their participants’ behavior, they also live in fear of something going disastrously wrong. On an episode of “Survivor” that aired on CBS last year, multiple contestants collapsed in the Cambodian heat, with one having to be taken to the hospital.
