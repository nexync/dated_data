In time for the men’s wear shows, which kick off in London this weekend, T and the casting director Arianna Pradarelli round up the runway’s most intriguing new faces.
Parris remembers his first runway turn, at Prada’s spring/summer 2017 show: “When I posted that on Instagram, my account exploded,” he says. “And when I came home I had a lot of media attention, as well.” He is a skilled dancer and has been practicing since age 3. (His Instagram provides proof.) “I always listen to music in the shower and I’m addicted to watching clips on YouTube,” he says.

Born and raised in a small Spanish town near Barcelona, Campelo left the country for the first time last month — for his first photo shoot, an editorial in London. Campelo is excited to see who he meets backstage at the shows, but “the most important things to me,” he writes, “are my family, friends and girlfriend” — and boxing, his number-one hobby.

The Michigander has hit the catwalk for Raf Simons and modeled for the much-talked-about Esprit by Opening Ceremony collection, but his “most memorable experience from the fashion world would be when Young Thug stopped me on the VFiles runway,” he says, referring to when the performer doubled as the Vfiles designers’ mentor and touched up Hunt’s lapel midshow.
