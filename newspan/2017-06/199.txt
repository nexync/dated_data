These days, the pure pop stars and the anti-pop pop stars reside side by side, in uneasy symbiosis. They need each other, in a way — both groups with the same goals, but also indirectly undermining the approach of the others along the way.
On this week’s Popcast, Mr. Caramanica is joined by Caryn Ganz, The New York Times’s pop music editor, and Joe Coscarelli, The Times’s pop music reporter, to discuss what these albums have to say about the current moment in pop music, and also, implicitly, about each other.
