Jimmy Buffett’s tropical paradise will land in a chilly New York this winter with the opening of the musical “Escape to Margaritaville” on Broadway.
The show, which features new songs as well as past hits that embody Mr. Buffett’s beach-resort brand, is to begin preview performances at the Marquis Theater on Feb. 16, the producers announced on Monday, with opening night planned for March 15.
“Well, going to Broadway is a dream come true, but to be coming to the Marquis is like having a great margarita with a tequila floater,” Mr. Buffett said in a statement.
The musical, about a part-time bartender and singer named Tully whose priorities are upended by his love for a tourist, recently had its premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in California. In January, the producers announced that it would travel to New Orleans, Houston and Chicago ahead of its Broadway debut.
Classic songs by Mr. Buffett in the show include “Come Monday,” “Volcano” and “Cheeseburger in Paradise.” Greg Garcia (“My Name Is Earl”) and Mike O’Malley (“Shameless”) wrote the book. Christopher Ashley (“Come From Away”) will direct.
In the 1990s, Mr. Buffett had another foray into musical theater with “Don’t Stop the Carnival,” written with Herman Wouk. The show was unsuccessful, both critically and commercially, and never made it to Broadway.
