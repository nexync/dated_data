As an artist known for documenting his fellow pro-skateboarders living like rock stars on tour, Ed Templeton’s home life in Huntington Beach, Calif., sounds surprisingly provincial. Every day, he and his wife Deanna take a walk down to the pier for what Templeton calls a “daily photo mission,” a mental and physical exercise that continues to hone the situational awareness he developed as a skateboarder. “Being out in the streets, a lot of times in bad neighborhoods, trying to skate spots, is what gave me an eye for looking 20 paces ahead and being ready for something,” Templeton says. Many of the fleeting moments that Templeton has captured throughout his career, from teenage kissers to surfers and skaters, are loosely arranged by theme in the exhibition “Amalgamated Fragments,” on view at Danziger Gallery in New York City through July 27.
