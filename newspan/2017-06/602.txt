Our guide to stand-up, improv and variety shows.
‘THE MACAULAY CULKIN SHOW SUMMER COMEDY FESTIVAL 2017’ at Shea Stadium BK (June 11, 8 p.m.). Sally Burtnick and Brett Davis have hosted this eclectic comedy show, which is in no way associated with the titular actor, since 2013. Every year, they host an overflowing show, inviting dozens of comics to do five-minute sets. Now that the venue Shea Stadium is closing, the event is hosting one last blowout. More than 30 musical, stand-up, sketch and storytelling performers are scheduled to appear, including Dave Hill, Jo Firestone, Joe Pera, Connor O’Malley, Joel Kim Booster and Josh Gondelman.
EDDIE IZZARD at the Town Hall (June 14, 7 p.m.). Mr. Izzard’s performances have always been special, a mix of absurdist stand-up and stream-of-consciousness storytelling that explores historical and social issues. Now he celebrates his new book, “Believe Me,” with a night of comedy, readings and audience questions. The book explores his difficult childhood and his ventures into show business and politics. Each ticket comes with a copy.
‘WE BEE SPELLING’ at the Knitting Factory Brooklyn (June 14, 7:30 p.m.). This comedy game show is a twist on the traditional childhood spelling bee. The show includes a live band and guest comedians, as well as contestants onstage who are at the whim of audience sabotages, which can throw them off their game with extra challenges. This edition, which features the comedians Kyle Ayers and Tow Cowell, raises money for the local education nonprofits Build NYC, Room to Read, Inclusion, and Pencil.
