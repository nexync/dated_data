A 21st-century bridge, with a life expectancy of a hundred years, should be not only beautiful but also functional.
The existing congestion should be reduced either by introducing transit or with high-occupancy managed lanes for vehicular traffic. Unfortunately, neither option is ready for the opening of the bridge next year.
So travelers will still be stuck in traffic on the same four lanes of the bridge and along the Interstate corridor during peak commuting hours. This is not progress!
