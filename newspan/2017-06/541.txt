While Mr. Trump was turning his father’s Queens real estate business into an icon of '80s Manhattan excess, David Rubenstein co-founded the Carlyle Group in Washington in 1987, building it into one of the world’s largest private equity firms.
At 67, he sees himself a part of the generation of public servants who answered John F. Kennedy’s call to ask what they can do for their country.
Quite a lot, it turned out, in Mr. Rubenstein’s case. Born in Baltimore to a postal worker and a homemaker, Mr. Rubenstein cycled in his early career between work as a lawyer and in government, including as a domestic policy adviser in the Carter White House.
In 2010, Mr. Rubenstein signed the Giving Pledge, a commitment to donate more than half of his wealth to philanthropy. Mr. Rubenstein, who is worth about $2 billion, wants to give away well over half, hoping to inspire would-be philanthropists in America and abroad, where such charity is less prevalent.
Mr. Rubenstein does not want to examine Mr. Trump’s role in our divisive politics, his lack of philanthropy, or his failure to separate public service and private gain. That would harm his quest to blow on the dying embers of social bipartisanship — efforts that seemed to suffer a grave setback less than a day after our conversation, when a gunman opened fire on Republicans practicing for last week’s bipartisan bipartisan congressional baseball game, after which there was much finger-pointing about who is responsible for America’s toxic political atmosphere.
