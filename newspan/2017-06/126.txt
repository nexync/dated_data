As someone who has known and worked closely with Kamala Harris for many years, I can speak personally to her passion and effectiveness in addressing violence against women. As a prosecutor, California attorney general and now senator, Ms. Harris is one of the fiercest fighters on behalf of women you will ever find.
There is a horrific amount of violence experienced by women and girls across the globe. One in three women in the world, and up to three-quarters of women in some nations, experiences gender-based violence, including early and forced marriage, female genital mutilation and murder.
I must strongly disagree with the Op-Ed writers, however, that this violence is somehow linked to one religion. Or that women like Ms. Harris have been silent. They have not.
This is a problem we all must address, men and women, and I hope Ms. Hirsi Ali and Ms. Nomani will join with us to fight all forms of violence against women and girls.
