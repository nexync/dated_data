One of the most revered actors in Hollywood history has announced his retirement from acting.
Mr. Day-Lewis’s representatives declined to elaborate on what prompted this decision, which Variety reported on Tuesday afternoon.
Mr. Day-Lewis, 60, the only performer to win three Academy Awards in the best actor category (“My Left Foot,” “There Will Be Blood,” “Lincoln”), has taken sabbaticals before but has never announced a full retirement until now. He has finished filming “Phantom Thread,” written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which is set for release at the end of the year.
The British-born actor burst onto the American film scene in the 1980s with classics like “My Beautiful Laundrette” (1985) and “My Left Foot” (1989), and spent the next decade establishing himself as one of the finest method actors of his generation.
