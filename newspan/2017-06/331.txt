The 117th U.S. Open is in full swing — but golf, of course, has been around much longer than the tournament.
Scotland is often credited with inventing the game. The earliest known reference to golf is a 1457 Scottish parliamentary resolution banning it as a distraction from archery practice, which was required for national defense.
The ban, passed by King James II, was lifted in 1500. Within two years, James II’s grandson, James IV, took up the game. Luckily for him, his grandfather had already passed away, in 1460, and was thus unable to be disappointed in his golf-playing descendant.
But Heiner Gillmeister, a German historian and an author of the Encyclopaedia Britannica entry for golf, has argued that a version was first played in Continental Europe.
The Chinese also claim golf, via chuiwan — literally, “hit ball” — a game that one museum exhibition has asserted was played by Song and Jin dynasty emperors as early as the 12th century.
Another sports scholar, Ling Hongling, a retired physical education professor at Northwest Normal University in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, traces golf’s origin to the Nantang dynasty, five centuries before the Scottish parliamentary resolution.
Whatever golf’s origins, its frustrations span centuries.
According to one Times columnist, Jay Caspian Kang, the pastime is “deceitful above all things,” making one believe it can be mastered with the mind, not the body.
But “no profound thought actually works on the course,” Mr. Kang lamented.
“A Scotsman, who was once singing its praises, admitted that it led to much profanity, and that he, being in the ministry, had had to give it up,” the editors wrote.
