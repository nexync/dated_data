Six new paperbacks to check out this week.
THE GERMAN WAR. A NATION UNDER ARMS, 1939-1945: CITIZENS AND SOLDIERS, by Nicholas Stargardt. (Basic Books, $22.99.) Drawing on personal correspondence and diaries, the author investigates an unusual approach to World War II, examining why ordinary Germans — who were both victims and perpetrators of violence — continued to support the effort to the end, and how they struggled to understand their place in it.
CHRONICLE OF A LAST SUMMER: A NOVEL OF EGYPT, by Yasmine El Rashidi. (Tim Duggan, $15.) The stories of three summers — as a child in Cairo, a college student and an adult filmmaker after the Arab Spring — chart the narrator’s political awakening. Growing up in the 1980s, she grappled with private griefs, like her father’s inexplicable disappearance; years later, she considers their ramifications.
BRIGHT, PRECIOUS DAYS, by Jay McInerney. (Vintage Contemporaries, $16.95.) This novel, the third to center on Russell and Corrine Calloway, yuppies who travel in rarefied New York circles, follows its characters as they confront the restlessness of middle age. Like its predecessors, the story is set during an upheaval — the 2008 financial crisis — that coincides with Russell’s financial and professional insecurity. A destabilizing force from the past, Corinne’s former lover, returns, and the Calloways must rebuild their marriage.
LATE TO THE BALL: A JOURNEY INTO TENNIS AND AGING, by Gerald Marzorati. (Scribner, $17.) The author, who was until 2010 the editor of The New York Times Magazine, reflects on taking up the sport as his career was winding down. In detailing his impulse to improve both his athletic acumen and himself as he approached “young old age,” Marzorati offers a thoughtful guide to growing older and dispensing with fixed ideas about age and ability.
