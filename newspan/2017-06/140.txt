LONDON — A sleepy English village. An unexpected death; then another. A foreign detective with pedantic habits and a host of potential suspects with secrets to hide.
No, this murder mystery is not by Agatha Christie, but by Anthony Horowitz, whose “Magpie Murders” was published by Harper in the United States this week. It’s the first original murder mystery novel from Mr. Horowitz, best known for his popular Alex Rider spy series for teenagers but also a prolific television screenwriter who has created, among other dramas and films, “Foyle’s War” and “Midsomer Murders.” In “Magpie Murders,” which was greeted with general appreciation by British critics when it was published here in October, Mr. Horowitz makes gleeful use of the Christie format by creating a 1950s mystery within another mystery, set in contemporary London.
Let the sleuthing begin!
“I’ve always loved the genre, and I’ve written dozens of murder mysteries on TV but have resisted writing one as a book until now,” Mr. Horowitz, 62, said in an interview at his north London home, a converted warehouse that he share with his wife, Jill Green, a television producer, and their two adult sons, who occupy apartments on separate floors.
Although he has written two Sherlock Holmes novels, sanctioned by the Conan Doyle estate (“Moriarty” and “The House of Silk”), he said that he had hesitated to write an adult mystery in his own voice.
Mr. Horowitz said he writes every day, using a fountain pen for his first drafts (“I love the physicality, the scratch of the nib, the crumpled balls of paper”), wherever he finds himself.
