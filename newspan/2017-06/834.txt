As tempting as an apricot-raspberry pie, a tomato-corn biscuit pie, a wineberry mascarpone pie or a zucchini-Cheddar puff pie may be, they taste even better when baked in a farmhouse kitchen with seasonal bounty from nearby orchards and fields. At the Farm Cooking School, on the Roots to River Organic Farm in New Jersey, monthly hands-on pie-making classes are taught by Ian Knauer and Shelley Wiseman, former Gourmet magazine editors. The types of pies vary according to the harvest, and each class includes instruction in making different kinds of pastry. The school offers other classes, including five-day and weekend sessions: Pies, June 16, July 7, Aug. 12, each from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., $95, the Farm Cooking School, 67 Pleasant Valley Road, Titusville, N.J., thefarmcookingschool.com.
