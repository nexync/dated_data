VATICAN CITY — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Saturday that Pope Francis had encouraged her to work to preserve the Paris climate accord despite the United States’ decision to withdraw and that he shared her aim to “bring down walls,” not build them.
Ms. Merkel met with the pope for about 40 minutes on Saturday in the Apostolic Palace, focusing on a Group of 20 summit meeting that Germany will host in Hamburg from July 7-8.
Francis has consistently called for nations to build bridges, not walls — an apparent reference to the wall that President Trump wants to build on the border with Mexico.
Ms. Merkel said Francis had encouraged her to fight for international agreements, including the 2015 Paris climate accord, which aims to curb heat-trapping emissions.
“We know that, regrettably, the United States is leaving this accord,” Ms. Merkel said.
As he did when Mr. Trump visited last month, Francis gave Ms. Merkel a copy of his environmental encyclical, “Praise Be,” which casts fighting climate change and caring for the environment as urgent moral obligations.
The audience began with Francis expressing his condolences over the death of Helmut Kohl, Germany’s chancellor from 1982 to 1998. In his formal note, Francis called Mr. Kohl a “great statesman and convinced European” who worked tirelessly for the unity of his country and the Continent.
