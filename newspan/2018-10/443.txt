A reader says she will be missed, in Germany and on the world stage.
It has been almost 75 years since the end of World War II, and Western Europe has lived in relative peace and prosperity. That was in no small part thanks to people like Chancellor Angela Markel, an intelligent, unique leader, significantly important not only in Germany but also worldwide. She will be sorely missed and not easily replaced.
We need to be concerned that Europe will be overwhelmed by leaders of the extreme right, undoing all that has been accomplished since 1945.
