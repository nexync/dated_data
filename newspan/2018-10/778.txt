When the Cleveland Orchestra fired its longtime concertmaster, William Preucil, last week amid accusations of sexual misconduct, the news soon resonated beyond the orchestra world to music teachers and the parents of violin students.
On Tuesday, Alfred Music, the publisher of the Suzuki books and recordings, said it would replace its recordings featuring Mr. Preucil.
It is a stunning turn of events in the Suzuki world, where the participation of Mr. Preucil, who was at the top of his field, was a point of pride. He comes from a family of musicians, and his parents helped pioneer the Suzuki Method in the United States.
The announcement came after the Cleveland Orchestra fired Mr. Preucil when an investigation concluded that he had engaged in “actions ranging from serious sexual misconduct to sexually harassing behavior” with a number of women, the youngest of whom was 17.
Mr. Preucil did not respond to an email seeking comment. The report of the investigation said that Mr. Preucil had denied most of the allegations against him, but had admitted to engaging in sexual contact with three female students, which he acknowledged was wrong.
