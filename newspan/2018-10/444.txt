Tina Turner’s By the Book interview is a nesting Russian doll of wonderful details. Where to start? With a psychic telling Turner she was an Egyptian pharaoh in a past life? With her deep love for Jackie Kennedy? With Buddhist chanting giving her the courage to leave Ike? With all the questions she has for Dante? These joys and so much more await, alongside the rundown of her favorite books.
Kacey Musgraves took an LSD trip and returned with the concept for “Slow Burn,” a song that set the tone for her genre-bending country album. Using FaceTime interviews, demos and doodles, we show you how the track came together.
Happy Diary of a Song day! This time Joe Coscarelli chats with Kacey Musgraves and her producers about “Slow Burn,” a song that was inspired by an acid trip. The video includes some excellent use of emojis, which it’s great to see The Times investing in.
• This Times interactive, which tracks 201 men (many in the movie, TV and music industries) who lost professional opportunities because of #MeToo, is pretty staggering.
• A recording has surfaced of XXXTentacion, the rapper who was shot and killed this summer, seeming to admit to crimes including domestic abuse and stabbings. The tape is from around 2016.
• Social has been all a-flurry after the police in England posted a photo of a robbery suspect who looked very much like David Schwimmer. The police went as far as to confirm that Schwimmer was in the United States at the time.
If Tejal Rao’s description of Japan’s luxurious Kit Kat boutiques doesn’t make you want to jump on a plane immediately, we are very different people. There’s a very Willy Wonka sense of wonder to the candy’s cult status in Japan, and it’s a delight to explore it.
Any good trailers drop today?
• The bright and fizzy “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” will be back for Season 2 on Dec. 5. It looks like business as usual in this first trailer, with quips, hats and chauvinism galore.
• The twist in Netflix’s apocalypse movie “Bird Box” is that to survive, people must navigate the world blind. I’m not convinced this will be as tense as the silence in “A Quiet Place,” but the cast includes Sandra Bullock, Sarah Paulson and John Malkovich, who I would watch in basically anything.
