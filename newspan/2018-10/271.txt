About two dozen people gathered outside a Washington Heights subway station on Sunday afternoon to remember an Uber driver who became the seventh for-hire driver in New York to commit suicide within the last year. The mood at the vigil turned from somber to anger in less than 30 minutes.
Fausto Luna jumped in front of an A train on Sept. 26 at the 175th Street and Fort Washington Avenue station. He is the first Uber driver this year to commit suicide in New York City. The other six drivers drove yellow taxi cabs or for livery or black car services.
Uber said Mr. Luna was a longtime driver with a high rating and consistent earnings. He owned his vehicle, and it was fully paid for, the company said.
At the vigil, attendees brought signs bearing Mr. Luna’s name along with the names of the six other for-hire drivers who died. Many spoke out against the mistreatment of for-hire drivers.
Mr. Luna’s death comes after New York became the first major American city to halt new vehicle licenses for ride-hailing services as the city studies the industry more.
But Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, criticized Uber.
“Every city needs to take a deeper look at what happens when you let Wall Street-backed corporations use billions of dollars in capital to lock workers into a prison of poverty,” she said in a statement.
