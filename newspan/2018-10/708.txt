When the violinist Leila Josefowicz was given the $100,000 Avery Fisher Prize on Thursday evening, she was at David Geffen Hall with the New York Philharmonic performing Stravinsky’s Violin Concerto in D — which counts almost as early music for her.
Ms. Josefowicz is one of classical music’s great champions of the new, and has introduced works by many of today’s leading composers — including John Adams, who wrote “Scheherazade.2,” a dramatic portrait of a woman confronting oppression, for her in 2015.
In an interview, Ms. Josefowicz, 40, said that she grew enamored of new music at a crucial turning point: as she was making the transition from child prodigy to mature artist. She had performed with an orchestra by the age of 8, gotten professional management by 13 and appeared on television with Johnny Carson, and in a Bob Hope special, while still a child.
She has now done that, repeatedly. In addition to Mr. Adams, she has championed composers including Colin Matthews, Steven Mackey, Luca Francesconi and Esa-Pekka Salonen, who wrote his Violin Concerto for her.
Winning the prestigious Fisher prize also earns Ms. Josefowicz a place on a plaque in Geffen Hall (formerly Avery Fisher Hall) alongside past recipients including the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, the pianist Emanuel Ax, and the violinists Midori and Joshua Bell.
Ms. Josefowicz noted that the award came during a year in which she had lost two formative figures in her career — the British composer Oliver Knussen, whose work she played frequently and who she said had been “very much responsible for carving out my new path with 20th- and 21st-century music,” and her early manager, Charles Hamlen, who she said had protected her as a young musician, often urging patience. “He said I had time,” she recalled.
