Character matters, in literature as much as life. This week’s recommended titles delve deep into the stories of complicated individuals, whether through biography (Gandhi, Lorraine Hansberry) or memoir (Sally Field, Marwan Hisham) or fiction (the heroine of John Wray’s novel, derived from a real-life figure, is an American fighting for the Taliban). For readers who prefer a wide-angle lens, we offer a manifesto about female rage, a simmering thriller from Tana French about the ways that privilege protects and blinds its recipients, and a celebration of libraries that opens with the harrowing tale of a fire tearing through the stacks. It will make you feel even more protective of your books than you do already.
THE LIBRARY BOOK, by Susan Orlean. (Simon & Schuster, $28.) The subject that inspired “The Library Book” was a 1986 fire at the Los Angeles Central Library in which 400,000 books were incinerated and another 700,000 were damaged. But Orlean’s new book is not just about that event; it is also a history of libraries and the personal story of Orlean and her mother, and the author’s library-centric childhood in suburban Cleveland. “What makes ‘The Library Book’ so enjoyable is the sense of discovery that propels it, the buoyancy when Orlean is surprised or moved by what she finds,” says our critic Jennifer Szalai.
