Suzan-Lori Parks already has a Pulitzer. Now she’s getting a Mimi.
The much-lauded dramatist has been chosen as the 2018 recipient of the Steinberg Distinguished Playwright Award, to be given on Dec. 3. The prize is among the richest in theater — a $200,000 cash award from the Harold and Mimi Steinberg Charitable Trust (hence its nickname, Mimi).
Ms. Parks is best known as the author of “Topdog/Underdog,” a pointed comedy about two black brothers that ran on Broadway in 2002 and won the Pulitzer that same year. Earlier this year, a group of New York Times critics chose it as the best American play of the last 25 years.
The distinguished playwright award, designated for “an American playwright whose body of work has made significant contributions to the American theater,” is given every other year; in the alternating years, the foundation gives an award for rising American playwrights. Past recipients of the distinguished playwright award include Tony Kushner, Lynn Nottage, David Henry Hwang, Stephen Adly Guirgis and Sarah Ruhl.
