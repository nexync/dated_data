A look at one of the entries that stumped solvers from last week’s puzzles.
The solvers of last week’s puzzles found a few reasons to be stumped by Michael Paleos’s Wednesday, Oct. 24 puzzle, but one entry in particular gave them trouble.
The ORINOCO River is one of the longest rivers in South America at 1,497.5 miles and, according to NewWorldEncyclopedia.org, is one of the largest river systems in the world. The river was named by the Warao, an indigenous tribe with an intimate connection to the waterway, and means “a place to paddle” in their language.
Home to an abundance of fauna, the ORINOCO River is also a habitat of the carnivorous piranha, which is how it was clued in last Wednesday’s puzzle.
ORINOCO has appeared in The New York Times puzzle a total of 60 times.
