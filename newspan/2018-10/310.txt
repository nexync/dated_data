What’s at stake is much more than a single Supreme Court seat.
For instance, the constant pining about justices who will interpret the “original intent” of the Constitution feels far bigger than single issues like gun control.
This is also what the demonizing of the visa lottery program is all about. As the Pew Research Center pointed out in August: “In fiscal 2017, which ended Sept. 30, the largest number of visas went to citizens of African countries” while applicants from European countries and from Asia received fewer visas than before.
The effort to demonize the lottery program is an effort to preserve America’s white majority, against the statistical eventuality, for as long as possible.
And that is also what voter disenfranchisement and Citizens United are about. That is why conservatives cheer the moves by young liberals to densely populated cities. The move weakens conservative votes in the places they move to and strengthens it in places they move from.
