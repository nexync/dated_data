LONDON — The former head of Britain’s foreign intelligence service, John Sawers, warned on Friday that the country’s security would be severely compromised if it left the European Union in the spring, and called on voters to reverse the “strategic mistake” in a second referendum.
Mr. Sawers made the comments in a speech in Salisbury, the city where a team of Russian military intelligence officers traveled this spring to attack a former spy, Sergei V. Skripal. Not mincing words, he said that Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, now feels free to “treat Britain with contempt” because, in the age of Brexit and a fraying NATO alliance, it is isolated from its Western allies.
Russia poisoned another Russian, Alexander V. Litvinenko, in London in 2006. Mr. Sawers said it would not have staged another attack had it not perceived Britain as weakened.
Mr. Sawers, who headed the Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, from 2009 to 2014, also warned that by leaving the European Union, Britain would lose access to information-sharing mechanisms like passenger records and the Schengen Information System, slowing its ability to solve crimes and extradite suspects.
Mr. Sawers, a foreign policy adviser to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, is not the only intelligence mandarin to wade into Brexit’s security implications in recent days.
One of his predecessors at MI6, Richard Dearlove, who supports Britain’s departure from the bloc, this week denounced Mrs. May’s proposal to preserve information-sharing agreements with European allies. He said that would “put the autonomy of our armed forces in jeopardy and risk fatally compromising” the so-called “Five Eyes” alliance uniting Australia, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
