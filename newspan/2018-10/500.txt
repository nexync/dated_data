Seattle Seahawks linebacker Mychal Kendricks was suspended indefinitely after being found guilty of insider trading, the latest prominent player on the team to be sidelined.
The decision, which was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity because it had not yet been announced, comes after Kendricks admitted to the crime in August after charges were filed in the case, which stems from his relationship with a banker at Goldman Sachs who fed him nonpublic information in 2014 about corporate mergers. Kendricks had received $1.2 million in profits as a result of the information.
Shortly after the news of the suspension broke, Kendricks appeared to react to it on Twitter.
My faith is unwavering as I continue to pray.
Kendricks, who played his first six seasons in Philadelphia and helped the Eagles win the Super Bowl last season, signed a one-year contract with the Cleveland Browns. The Browns released Kendricks after he pleaded guilty.
Kendricks was allowed to play while he appealed the decision, and the Seahawks, in need of linebacker depth, signed him on Sept. 14 with the understanding he might be suspended. Now Kendricks, 28, could be facing prison time.
His suspension is the latest personnel headache for the Seahawks. On Sunday, free safety Earl Thomas III, who had been embroiled in contentious contract negotiations, broke his leg and was ruled out for the season.
In the off-season, the Seahawks also lost four defensive standouts: Cliff Avril, Michael Bennett, Kam Chancellor and Richard Sherman.
