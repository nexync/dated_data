Joe Burrow passed for 200 yards and had two short touchdown runs and host Louisiana State’s defense staggered Georgia’s normally prolific offense to lead the 13th-ranked Tigers past the No. 2 Bulldogs, 36-16, on Saturday to give Coach Ed Orgeron a signature victory.
Five fourth-down decisions by Orgeron influenced the result. L.S.U. converted all four times it ran an offensive play on fourth down, sustaining three drives that produced a total of 13 points.
In another instance, Orgeron called a timeout and elected to punt on fourth-and-2 after the offense initially remained on the field. That decision pinned Georgia at its own 4, and Kristian Fulton’s interception of Jake Fromm’s pass shortly afterward set up one of Cole Tracy’s five field goals.
Clyde Edwards-Helaire rushed for 133 yards for L.S.U. (6-1, 3-1 Southeastern Conference), and Justin Jefferson caught six passes for 108 yards, including a 41-yard snag of a pass rifled over the middle and between converging defenders. That catch set up Burrow’s second touchdown in the fourth quarter.
Nick Brossette added a short touchdown in the final minutes after Burrow’s 59-yard scamper.
Behind from the beginning, Georgia (6-1, 4-1) was unable to turn to its running game as much as it might have preferred. Averaging about 245 yards, the Bulldogs finished with only 113, led by D’Andre Swift’s 72 yards.
Ian Book threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Miles Boykin with 5 minutes 43 seconds remaining and No. 5 Notre Dame remained unbeaten, coming from behind and then holding off visiting Pittsburgh.
The Fighting Irish are 7-0 for the first time since 2012, the year they went to the Bowl Championship Series title game.
The Panthers led, 14-12, after a long first-quarter touchdown drive and a 99-yard kickoff return by Maurice Ffrench to start the second half.
Pat Narduzzi’s Panthers (3-4) were looking to upset an Associated Press top-five team for the third straight season after knocking off No. 3 Clemson in Death Valley during the 2016 season and No. 2 Miami last November in Pittsburgh.
The freshman Brock Purdy threw for 254 yards and three touchdowns and Iowa State throttled visiting West Virginia, handing the Mountaineers their first loss.
Iowa State (3-3, 2-2 Big 12) scored 20 straight points after spotting West Virginia (5-1, 3-1) an early touchdown off a turnover. Purdy then found Deshaunte Jones through a pair of defenders on a sprawling 32-yard scoring reception that, after a 2-point conversion, put Iowa State ahead by 28-14 with 12:17 to go.
Iowa State’s defense dominated the high-flying Mountaineers on a windy and chilly night, holding West Virginia to 152 yards.
Tua Tagovailoa passed for 265 yards and three touchdowns before leaving with an injury in host Alabama’s win over Missouri.
The Crimson Tide (7-0, 4-0 SEC) got a scare when Tagovailoa aggravated a sprained knee after sliding at the end of a run in the third quarter. Jalen Hurts led the Tide the rest of the way with a big lead already in place against the Tigers (3-3, 0-3).
Dwayne Haskins threw for 412 yards and three touchdown passes as Ohio State held off Minnesota in Columbus.
The Buckeyes (7-0, 4-0 Big Ten) needed Blake Haubiel’s two second-half field goals and Haskins’ late touchdown pass from K. J. Hill to put away the Gophers (3-3, 0-3).
Hill made the play of the game with a turnaround, one-hand grab that he turned into a touchdown in the second quarter. He finished with a career-high nine catches for 187 yards.
Brian Lewerke threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Felton Davis with 19 seconds left to lift Michigan State over host Penn State.
It looked like the Spartans (4-2, 2-1 Big Ten) would regret an attempt at a trick play late in the game. After a 10-play drive deep into Penn State territory, Michigan State lined up for what could have been a tying 40-yard field goal with 5:19 left, but the Spartans faked the kick. The ploy failed when safety Garrett Taylor swatted Lewerke’s pass away from defensive tackle Raequan Williams.
But Penn State (4-2, 1-2) ran just seven plays on its next two possessions and gave Lewerke the ball back with 1:19 to play. Lewerke then put together an eight-play, 76-yard game-winning drive.
Shane Buechele came on for the injured quarterback Sam Ehlinger early in the first quarter to help Texas slug out a victory against visiting Baylor that ended when the Bears’ final pass sailed through the back of the end zone.
The victory makes Texas (6-1, 4-0 Big 12) bowl eligible, the first time the Longhorns have reached that milestone in mid-October since 2009. That year, Texas won the Big 12 and played for a national championship.
Charlie Brewer passed for 245 yards and a touchdown for the Bears (4-3, 2-2).
McKenzie Milton threw for 296 yards and ran for the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter as Central Florida weathered its first significant test of the season before escaping with a victory over host Memphis.
Milton’s 7-yard touchdown with 12:14 left completed a comeback for the Knights (6-0, 3-0 American Athletic Conference), who trailed the Tigers (4-3, 1-3) by 30-14 with 2:04 left in the first half. The victory was Central Florida’s 19th straight — the nation’s longest winning streak — but it was by far the toughest game of the season for the Knights, who defeated their first five opponents by double digits.
Shea Patterson accounted for 214 yards of offense and a touchdown, leading Michigan over visiting Wisconsin.
The Wolverines (6-1, 4-0 Big Ten) beat a ranked conference team for the first time since topping the Badgers two years ago.
Alex Hornibrook had perhaps the worst game of his career for the Badgers (4-2, 2-1), going 7 of 20 for 100 yards with one touchdown pass and two interceptions.
Jordan Scarlett ran 48 yards for the go-ahead touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter, and Florida rallied from an 18-point deficit to beat host Vanderbilt in a game marred by a near brawl.
An official held back Florida Coach Dahn Mullen as he yelled at Vanderbilt Coach Derek Mason, who was near the Gators’ sideline after checking on the Commodores defender whose helmet was knocked off by a hit by linebacker James Houston IV. Both teams spilled onto the field, drawing unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. The penalty cost the Gators Vosean Joseph, their leading tackler, who was ejected for his second such penalty of the first half.
The fracas overshadowed an offensive outburst by the Gators (6-1, 4-1 SEC), who scored 24 straight points after the Commodores (3-4, 0-3) jumped out to a 21-3 lead midway through the second quarter.
Jordan Ellis ran for a touchdown, Brian Delaney kicked four field goals and Virginia kept visiting Miami’s high-powered offense from ever getting going.
The Cavaliers (4-2, 2-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) let the Hurricanes (5-2, 2-1) pull to within 16-13 with 3:04 left when Malik Rosier scored on an 11-yard run. But Miami’s onsides kick was fielded by Virginia’s Evan Butts, who returned the ball 30 yards to the Miami 27. The Hurricanes used all three of their timeouts to stop the clock, but a personal foul call on Tito Odenigbo after Bryce Perkins was stopped a yard short of a first down ended their comeback bid.
C. J. Verdell scored on a 6-yard run in overtime and Oregon (5-1, 2-1 Pacific-12) knocked off Washington (5-2, 3-1).
Jarrett Guarantano passed for 328 yards and two touchdowns and visiting Tennessee ended an 11-game SEC losing streak.
The Volunteers (3-3, 1-2) forced three turnovers against a lackluster offensive performance by the Tigers (4-3, 1-3), intercepting two of Jarrett Stidham’s passes and getting a strip sack that resulted in a touchdown by Alontae Taylor.
Kellen Mond threw for 353 yards and the freshman Seth Small had four field goals, including the go-ahead kick in the fourth quarter, to lift visiting Texas A&M (5-2, 3-1 SEC) to a victory over South Carolina (3-3, 2-3).
Clayton Thorson threw for 455 yards and three touchdowns, and Drew Luckenbaugh kicked a 37-yard field goal in overtime to give host Northwestern a 34-31 victory, and send Nebraska to its worst start ever at 0-6, 0-4 Big Ten.

■ Ryan Glover’s 4-yard scoring run with 6:55 left lifted host Penn over Columbia, 13-10, giving the Quakers (4-1, 1-1) their first Ivy League victory of the season. The Lions, who have not won at Franklin Field since 1996, fell to 3-2, 0-2.

■ Jared Gerbino ran for two first-quarter touchdowns and was 3 for 3 passing with two scoring throws to lead Dartmouth (5-0) to a 42-0 victory over visiting Sacred Heart (3-3).
■ D’Erren Wilson threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to Chris Woodard off a reverse with six seconds to go as host Wagner (2-5, 1-1 Northeast Conference) rallied for a 23-22 victory against Saint Francis (2-4, 0-1).
