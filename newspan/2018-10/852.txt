A management expert sees a need for a new business model and more oversight.
“Russian Meddling Is Only a Symptom,” by Zeynep Tufekci (Op-Ed, Oct. 4), which discusses how tech companies profit from our country’s political polarization, raises one of the most important questions of our time: What would an ethical, socially responsible tech company look like?
For one thing, social impact assessments would be a mainstay that would guide its every action and policy. The company would continually ask itself: Who will be harmed by our actions and products? What are we obligated to do — and not to do — to cause as little harm as possible? How can we avoid harmful actions to begin with?
Tech is in a big crisis of its own making. It has little, if any, incentive or desire to reform itself. As with the cigarette companies before, we have to insist that tech companies be strictly regulated.
