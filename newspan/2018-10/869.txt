A great many indignities are heaped on Bill Pullman’s character, Ben, in “Trouble,” including pneumonia, a collapsed lung and a bullet to the chest. This last is delivered by his sister, Maggie (Anjelica Huston), though she’s not the only relative who wishes him ill: another tries to smother him with a pillow. Family, it seems, is not Ben’s forte.
Purportedly a comedy, this sophomore feature from the playwright Theresa Rebeck is so dismally unfunny that the descriptor should come with quotation marks. As Maggie, a widow living smugly on inherited land in rural Vermont, Ms. Huston doesn’t walk and talk so much as stride and yell. A tough-as-old-boots, indoor hat-wearer, Maggie is incredulous when the long-estranged Ben — a wastrel with a grotty trailer and not much else — shows up with a backhoe and a scheme to weasel a share of the land he claims is rightfully his. Feuding ensues.
Bogged down by a plot resting on unpaid taxes, illegally obtained permits and other real-estate paraphernalia, “Trouble” makes a whole lot of noise without saying very much. The direction is wooden and the cinematography dull, leaving the solid cast (including Julia Stiles as a daffy clerk and Jim Parrack as her knuckle-dragging boyfriend) to shoulder the weight. David Morse is gratifyingly restrained as a friend with an inexplicable crush on Maggie, but it’s Mr. Pullman who’s worth watching. Most recently, in a fascinatingly off-kilter performance as a damaged detective in “The Sinner” on USA Network, he reminded us there’s always been something itchy and unreliable about his work, an unsteadiness that humanizes his dented characters. Ben might be reprehensible, but somehow he persuades us it’s Maggie who deserves to go down.
