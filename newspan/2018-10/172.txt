His Novel Describes the Dark Side of Internet Fame. Hank Green Knows Something About That.
In Hank Green’s debut novel, “An Absolutely Remarkable Thing” — which debuts on the fiction list at No. 1 — 23-year-old April May, coming home from work late one night in New York City, stumbles upon an enormous metal sculpture planted on the sidewalk, “a 10-foot-tall Transformer wearing a suit of samurai armor, its huge barrel chest lifted up to the sky.” She and a friend shoot a video of it, which they upload to YouTube, and go to bed. By the next morning, the video has gone viral, transforming April into an internet celebrity.
Green tapped into his own experiences — and those of friends — for April’s story. “If you have exceptional experiences, why not use them?” he says, describing how his interview with Barack Obama played out in a scene where April talks to the president.
