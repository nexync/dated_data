Good Thursday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.
• James A. Baker, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s former top lawyer, told congressional officials that he had taken seriously a suggestion by the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to secretly tape conversations with President Trump, but that the idea was dismissed within days. Read the story.
• The Justice Department said that a Chinese intelligence officer was arrested in Belgium and brought to the United States to face espionage charges, a first. Read the story.
• For Mr. Trump, the possible murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, in Turkey is a looming diplomatic crisis. For the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, it is a personal reckoning.
• A Californian was sentenced to six months in prison for selling bank account information that helped Russia wage a social media disinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential race. It could be a sign that the Mueller investigation is coming to a close.
• The confirmation of William N. Bryan, Mr. Trump’s nominee for a top Homeland Security post, has been complicated by revelations about his past business dealings while in Ukraine. Read the story.
• On Wednesday, a Supreme Court argument on immigrant detentions appeared to reveal a gap between Mr. Trump’s two appointees, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. Read the story.
• The F.B.I. director defended the handling of an abbreviated background check into Justice Kavanaugh, saying the inquiry was “consistent with the standard process for such investigations going back quite a long ways.” Read the story.
• A test of the Pentagon’s digital vulnerabilities showed that hackers could quickly access and even disable weapons systems under development — sometimes without the military ever detecting it.
• The Treasury Department is rolling out a pilot program that will allow the United States to block a broad array of foreign investments on national security grounds. The Trump administration is wasting no time in using the program on China.
• Mr. Trump signed bipartisan legislation to ban “gag clauses,” which prevent pharmacists from telling consumers about the best prescription drug prices. Despite the sign of bipartisanship, health care remains one of the most divisive issues in the midterms.
• Ahead of the November elections, the president is trying to turn the tables on Democrats by accusing them of being what they say he is: “unhinged,” “wacko” and “dangerous.” Read the story.
• In a Pennsylvania congressional district, the politics of guns looms large before the midterms, but with a twist: Both candidates are tryi ng to claim the gun-control mantle.
• California has been responsible for a fifth of the United States’ economic growth since the end of the recession. But a financial disaster may be coming, and just in time for a new governor.
