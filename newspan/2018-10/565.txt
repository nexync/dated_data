A reader recalls an encounter with Caroll Spinney, who is retiring from the role after almost 50 years.
With a chance meeting at breakfast in the Bahamas, I can confirm that Caroll Spinney, who played the role for almost 50 years, embodies just as much of the true nature of Big Bird as anyone with exposure to the show would expect.
I will never forget that breakfast. Fly on, Mr. Spinney. Fly on and happy retirement!
