• President Trump’s inherited fortune.
“I built what I built myself,” Mr. Trump has often said.
But a special Times investigation, based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, has found that his fortune is deeply connected to the riches of his father, the New York City builder Fred Trump. Above, father and son.
Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year from his father’s empire by age 3. He was a millionaire by age 8. He received at least $413 million in today’s dollars from his father in total.
Much of the money he received as an adult came from helping his parents dodge taxes — setting up sham corporations, filing improper deductions and even undervaluing real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars, records and interviews show. Some schemes were outright fraud, the investigation found. Here are 11 takeaways.
A lawyer for Mr. Trump called the findings “100 percent false, and highly defamatory.” Read his full statement.

The 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry will be announced today. In 1911, this honor went to Marie Curie, above, for her discovery of the elements radium and polonium. She was the first woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize.
It was her second Nobel: In 1903 she shared the physics prize with her husband and another French scientist for their work on radioactivity.
Marie Curie came from humble beginnings. Born Maria Sklodowska in Poland in 1867, she was the youngest of five children.
Marie Curie died in 1934 as a result of exposure to radioactivity, some of it incurred while preparing radium for medical use.
She has been the topic of many books and movies. A recent BBC poll deemed her the most influential woman in history.
