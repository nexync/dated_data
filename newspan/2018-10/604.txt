NAIROBI, Kenya â€” At least 50 people, including seven children, were killed in western Kenya when a bus swerved off a road, rolled down a slope and crashed, ripping off the roof, an official said on Wednesday.
The bus was traveling from the capital, Nairobi, to the western town of Kakamega when it crashed around 4 a.m., said Francis Munyambu, the head of the Rift Valley regional police. About 15 survivors were hospitalized, he said.
The number of accidents in Kenya is on the rise, with the World Health Organization describing the roads in the country as among the most dangerous in the world, claiming around 29.1 lives per 100,000 people, according to a 2015 report.
Government statistics in Kenya show that around 3,000 people die each year in road accidents, and the country has struggled to reduce the number of fatalities.
Roads are increasingly crowded as more members of the growing middle class acquire cars, and a government effort to reintroduce breathalyzers was rejected after court orders prohibited the police from charging drivers based on readings from the devices.
