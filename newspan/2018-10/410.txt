New Yorkers wait in line. Lots of lines. For anything.
If you are a true New Yorker, you have probably spent a Sunday waiting in line at a restaurant that serves the same brunch dishes as the empty joint next door, while your earbuds play some sort of yacht rock music provided by your insurance company or mortgage holder, which has, of course, put you on hold.
It’s how New Yorkers build up the reserves of hostile energy that keep the lights burning.
If you are a visitor to New York, a go-to activity might be lining up in front of a Broadway theater well before the house opens, even though your ticket guarantees you the same seat if you arrive at the last minute. It’s where you meet the most interesting people, none of them New Yorkers.
The photographer Natan Dvir, who moved to New York from Israel in 2008, was stunned by the local tendency toward lines. He was waiting amid a crowd at a bus stop, and when the bus pulled up, everyone magically took positions in line, as if they had choreographed it in advance.
He found lines at bus stations, restaurants, bathrooms and outside boutiques offering limited-edition sneakers, where posting photos of the line on Instagram was half the fun. Lines were subcultures unto themselves. The lines in Midtown Manhattan were different from those in Flushing, Queens; the lines for Cronuts were different from those outside the Human Resources Administration.
