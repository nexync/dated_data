It’s off the beaten path, but the Bell Market at Bell Works has plenty of food offerings in a striking setting.
The Finnish architect Eero Saarinen designed Bell Labs — built in Holmdel, N.J., from 1959 to 1962 — as a low, sweeping building sheathed in mirrored glass, with a soaring atrium. In 2016, the AT&T research hub was repurposed as Bell Works, an office building where an array of companies, some in the tech field, have rented space. Last year it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. But the people who visit or work there have to eat, so Bell Market, a sleek food hall on the ground floor, has just opened. There you’ll find wood-fired pizza from Corbo & Sons; Honeybell Bakery, producing breads and pastries; a New York-style deli, Bubz, with bagels and sandwiches; Jozu, for rice bowls, hand rolls, ramen and robata; and Broadfork, for salad and grain bowls.
