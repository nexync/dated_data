BERLIN — Many people thought Bavaria’s election would be a backlash against the hundreds of thousands of migrants Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed into Germany three years ago. It turned out to be a backlash against Ms. Merkel herself.
In last year’s national election, all three governing parties slumped to their worst postwar results, but they stumbled on in an unpopular coalition, turning the far-right Alternative for Germany party into the main voice of opposition.
A year later, the Bavarian election was not, strictly speaking, a referendum on Ms. Merkel, whose conservatives do not compete there, leaving the field to their Bavarian sister party. But voters loudly pronounced on the “grand coalition” she has come to personify: a capacious left-right governing alliance that has stifled debate between erstwhile political rivals.
But the Greens, running on a platform of open borders, liberal social values and the fight against climate change, gained more. The once-fringe environmental party has now emerged as one of the strongest forces in German politics. It doubled its vote in Bavaria, to nearly 17.5 percent in an election in which turnout surged to over 70 percent.
That strategy has paid off for the Greens in Bavaria and beyond, analysts say.
