Rap duos like Lil Baby and Gunna and Future and Juice WRLD are dominating streaming services. But they’ve been no match for the hottest musical pair of the moment: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.
In a rarity, rock has the next two spots, thanks to bundling deals that included an album with the purchase of a concert ticket: Greta Van Fleet, the Led Zeppelin-biting throwback act, is No. 3 with “Anthem of the Peaceful Army,” its debut album, while the veteran hard-rock band Disturbed is No. 4 with “Evolution,” its seventh full-length release. Streams were not a strong point for either album: “Anthem” totaled eight million and “Evolution” had six million.
Lil Wayne’s “The Carter V,” which debuted at No. 1 four weeks ago, fell to No. 5 from No. 3 this week, garnering another 75 million streams toward 65,000 total units.
