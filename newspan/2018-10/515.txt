I couldn’t put the bust in the living room because that would be pretentious. Also, I can’t have it in the living room and be watching “Real Housewives” — I don’t need the bust judging my TV habits. It lives in our office. That way, it can be watching over us while we’re working or surfing Instagram. And it has some weight to it, so if there’s an intruder in the house I can be like Richard Gere in “Unfaithful” and knock someone the hell out.
