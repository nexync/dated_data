SYDNEY, Australia — State lawmakers in Queensland voted on Wednesday to decriminalize abortion, scrapping a century-old law that had made it an offense punishable with prison time and making it the latest Australian state to loosen its restrictions.
Over the past decade, most of Australia’s states and territories have reduced restrictions on abortion. New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, is now the only state where abortion remains a criminal offense.
In Queensland, efforts to change the law had failed repeatedly, including an attempt last year that was withdrawn before lawmakers could vote.
Political analysts said one difference this time was that the State Parliament has more women, including in leadership roles. Both major parties are led by women for the first time, with Deb Frecklington becoming leader of the opposition Liberal National Party last year, while Ms. Palaszczuk leads the governing Labor Party.
Some expressed optimism that the elevated role of women would influence the debate on an issue that affects them but which has long been legislated by men.
