The director John Hyams has attracted the notice of some critics for his energetic direction of action movies, including “Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning,” from 2012. “All Square” represents a change of pace from his film work (he’s been directing a good deal of episodic television also) in that rather than martial arts or gunfire, the primary source of kinetics here is … youth baseball.
“All Square” is a comedy-drama about a bookmaker in a slump that’s directly related to the environment in which he’s forced to ply his trade. Michael Kelly plays John Zbikowski, who runs his illegal sports betting outfit out of a bar in a Maryland suburb. In a town where everybody knows everybody else, collections can be a real problem. Amicable proximity breeds a disinclination to cough up debts.
“I got mouths to feed,” John complains in voice-over. 
This back story is a bit familiar; less so is John’s innovation to take bets on youth baseball games, which turns into a temporary payday. At the same time, he gives pitching and life lessons to the son of a former high school fling, played by Pamela Adlon.
Hyams directs Timothy Brady’s script appropriately if not brilliantly (Hyams is also credited as a co-editor), but the movie’s main attraction, finally, is its cast. Kelly is a king among mordant underplayers. Yulin, a stalwart character actor, is reliably terrific. Adlon and Josh Lucas bring added value to their also-familiar characters.
