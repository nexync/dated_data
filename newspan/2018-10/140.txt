This newly renovated six-story walk-up, with 50 feet of frontage along a tree-lined street in the Kips Bay area, offers 30 apartments — nine four-bedrooms, 12 three-bedrooms and nine two-bedrooms — of which 25 are free market, four are rent-stabilized and one is rent-controlled. The 20,892-square-foot building also has a roof deck, a video intercom and a laundry room. The cap rate is about 4.6 percent.
A New York-based real estate investment firm has bought a 2,325-square-foot retail condo, occupied by Shape House, a sweat lodge where clients can sit and burn calories, on the ground floor of this 10-story building in the Flatiron district. The building, whose facade is covered in netting as it undergoes repointing, was recently converted into a condominium with eight floor-through apartments and a penthouse. Shape House, whose annual rent adds up to $216,000, has a lease running until 2024.
Dr. Jason Tabick, a chiropractor, has signed a five-year lease for a 900-square-foot ground-floor storefront, formerly a Pentecostal church, in this three-story mixed-use building. The building, now covered by scaffolding, is next to a mixed-use residential building under construction. The chiropractor, who received a two-month rent concession for its build out, is expected to open in November.
