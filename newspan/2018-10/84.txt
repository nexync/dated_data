BEIJING — Faculty members at Cornell University said on Monday that they were cutting ties with a leading Chinese university after reports that it was harassing and intimidating students campaigning for workers’ rights.
Scholars at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations said they were suspending a six-year-old research and exchange program with Renmin University in Beijing after the school punished at least a dozen students who joined a nationwide call for better protections for low-income workers in China.
“Their complicity in detaining students against their will is a serious red line for us,” he said.
The decision was a rare rebuke of China’s increasingly strict limits on human rights. Many American universities, seeking money and a global presence, have compromised on free speech values in forging partnerships with Chinese schools.
Human rights activists applauded Cornell’s decision to halt the program.
“I’m sure Cornell’s decision can have a positive effect on other universities, encouraging them to put principle above making money,” said Patrick Poon, a researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong.
“We should have academic freedom,” said Xiang Junwei, 21, an economics major. Mr. Xiang has accused the university of trying to intimidate his mother and of monitoring his activities.
