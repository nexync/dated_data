A prison chaplain writes about the silently suffering women she meets.
Watching the headlines of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation hearings and seeing the #MeToo movement rally around Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, I want to point out that there is a #MeToo core of women who are suffering silently about whom we know little.
But I know them. I am a prison chaplain. Many of the women I meet are incarcerated because of what the men in their lives have forced them to do. Some are serving long sentences for defending themselves against abuse and rape; some have agreed to take the rap for their spouses because the spouse is the wage earner; some have been led into drug-dealing and prostitution because they wanted to please their men, or were afraid of them. And some of them were just silent about the men who perpetrated horrible acts against them.
Before women are incarcerated, they need advocates who understand the special circumstances they face in our society. Until this happens, too many women will suffer behind barbed-wire fences and will not be helped by the #MeToo movement.
