Sarah Reyburn Nelson and Eduardo Vivanco Antolín were married Oct. 20. The Rev. Luther Zeigler performed the ceremony at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., with Alexander Nemerov delivering a homily and leading the couple through their vows.
Mrs. Vivanco, 40, is an art consultant in San Francisco. She graduated from Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., and received a master’s degree in art history from Richmond University in London.
She is a daughter of Pamela Bosten Nelson of Manchester-by-the-Sea, and the late Valle R. Nelson. The bride’s father was a partner in VIMAC Ventures, a Boston venture capital firm. Her mother retired as an executive assistant at Putnam Investments in Boston.
Mr. Vivanco, 44, is an architect and an adjunct assistant professor at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where he teaches courses on the history of architecture in the art department. He graduated with high honors from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid and received a master’s degree in art history from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he was a Fulbright scholar. He also received a master’s degree in the history of architecture from Yale and a doctoral degree in the history of art from Stanford.
He is a son of Delfina Antolín Baigorri of Madrid and the late Fernando Vivanco Sánchez. The groom’s mother retired as a researcher in the media archive at Televisión Española in Madrid. His father was a character actor, and appeared in films, including “Labyrinth of Passion” (1982); he was also a systems analyst consultant in Madrid.
The couple met in San Francisco in 2017 at the party of a mutual friend just days before Mr. Vivanco was to return, permanently, to Spain. But the airline he was flying with had gone bankrupt and he was stranded in the United States for an extra week and a half. It was just long enough for a romance to take hold.
