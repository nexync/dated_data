Dr. Andre Henri Goy and Jeffrey Brice Ornstein were married Oct. 13 at St. Luke’s Episcopal Church in East Hampton, N.Y. The Very Rev. Denis C. Brunelle, an Episcopal priest, led the ceremony.
Dr. Goy (left), 61, a hematologist/oncologist, is the chairman and the executive director of the John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack Meridian Health, the New Jersey statewide health network based in Hackensack, N.J. He is also a professor of medicine at both Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine in Nutley, N.J., and Georgetown University in Washington. He is the co-chairman of the Future of Health and Health Care Council for the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He graduated from Grenoble University, from which he also received a medical degree. He received a master’s degree in immunology from the Pasteur Institute in Paris and another in experimental oncology from the University of Paris X Nanterre.
He is a son of the late Clara L. Goy and the late Joseph N. Goy, who lived in Entremont, France.
Mr. Ornstein, 57, is the founder and the chief executive officer of JBrice Design International, an interior design firm in Boston, specializing in international hotel and resort design focusing on the Middle East. He graduated cum laude from Brandeis University.
He is a son of Mona M. Ornstein of Scottsdale, Ariz., and the late Robert J. Ornstein.
The couple met in 2008 during Labor Day weekend while working out on side-by-side treadmills at a gym in Provincetown, Mass. Over the next few months Mr. Ornstein remained steadfast in reaching out to Dr. Goy, who was somewhat elusive, and responded to an initial message or two, followed by radio silence. Three months later they finally met at an Italian restaurant in New York, and in a swift turn of events Dr. Goy said it was “coup de foudre,” or love at first sight, and became easier to reach.
