The Washington Times on Sunday retracted and apologized for a column about Seth Rich, the Democratic National Committee staff member whose unsolved killing sparked right-wing conspiracy theories about the 2016 election.
The retraction was part of a settlement of a lawsuit, according to Michael Gottlieb, a lawyer for Aaron Rich, who said he welcomed the apology.
In the column, James A. Lyons, a retired United States Navy admiral, asserted that “it is well known in the intelligence circles” that the Rich brothers were responsible for sharing a cache of committee emails with WikiLeaks. He also questioned why Aaron Rich had not been interviewed after his brother’s death.
In the retraction, The Times disavowed both allegations, writing that it had no basis to believe the statement about the intelligence community and acknowledging that Aaron Rich had been interviewed by law enforcement officials after his brother’s death.
Seth Rich was 27 when he was shot in the back near his Washington home in 2016. While the police have theorized that he may have been killed in a botched robbery attempt, right-wing commentators have repeatedly connected the death to the leaked Democratic National Committee emails, spawning an enduring conspiracy theory.
In July, Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, secured an indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers, accusing them of hacking the committee and working with WikiLeaks to spread the stolen emails.
The Times was not the first news organization to retract such assertions about Seth Rich. Fox News last year also retracted a story that linked his killing to the emails.
Lawyers and a spokeswoman for The Times did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.
