For a small light fixture, an exterior sconce can have an outsize effect on the way your home looks — especially as it gets dark earlier.
While a traditional home will often have two sconces on either side of the front door for symmetry, a modern home may need only one (the Atomic Industrial Guard Sconce, above, is $242 at Barn Light Electric Company).
As the days get shorter, outdoor sconces become increasingly important for illuminating a home’s comings and goings. But choosing the right ones is about more than just having enough light.
Because sconces are typically installed at eye level, their design can have an outsize effect on a home’s appearance.
Regardless of style, finding appropriately scaled sconces is crucial, Mr. Joyce said. “Sometimes I make paper cutouts the size of the intended sconces and hold them up,” he said, to make sure the actual fixtures won’t look too heavy or dainty.
How many sconces do you need? “A front door in a formal period home usually has two sconces” for symmetry, Mr. Joyce said, but the entrance to a more casual or contemporary home may require only one. On verandas, he often installs numerous sconces.
What do you want to illuminate? Some sconces have opaque shades that direct light down onto house numbers and steps, while others have clear or translucent shades for a porch-wide glow.
