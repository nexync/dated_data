The stylist Tiina Laakkonen’s clothing and design shop in Amagansett, Tiina the Store, returns to its original location after a yearlong renovation.
That’s an understatement: Since it opened in 2012, the Finnish-born stylist’s clothing and home goods shop, Tiina the Store, in the Long Island town of Amagansett, has become something of an institution — known for its unique mix of roomy striped shirtdresses from Casey Casey, supple sweaters by the Elder Statesman and cocoon coats by Sofie D’Hoore. Tiina offers ideas for how to dress — in baggy stripes, drop-crotch pants and fine cashmere — that are a refreshing take on uniform dressing, and a welcome antidote to other boutiques on the East End.
This month, after a yearlong renovation and a stint in a temporary location down the street, Tiina the Store reopened in its original location: a late 19th-century building on Main Street that has been completely overhauled. “We built an almost entirely new building from the basement up,” she says. Still intact is the historic storefront and low-ceilinged entrance room (where Laakkonen will display jewelry, assorted design objects, and perfumes and candles by the British brand Perfumer H), which opens up into a gleaming white double-height space with ceramic tile floors and exposed beams, as if a Japanese gallery were transposed onto a Hamptons living room.
The British designer Faye Toogood created pieces for the store’s interiors — bleached ash wood and felt stackable display cubes, powder-coated metal mesh shelves and racks, and her signature Roly Poly chairs; pieces from her clothing brand, Toogood, line the racks, too. Laakkonen has also mixed in her own finds, including a vintage Danish Montana cabinet system in Yves Klein blue (her favorite) that she bought at auction, and a Tapiovaara Kiki sofa covered in a Raf Simons Kvadrat striped fabric.
