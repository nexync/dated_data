Seven months after taking a leave of absence following sexual harassment allegations, the prominent architect Richard Meier is stepping down from the leadership of his firm, the office announced on Tuesday.
In March, five women, including four who had worked for his firm, accused Mr. Meier of sexual harassment, including episodes in which they said he exposed himself or touched them inappropriately.
Additional women subsequently came forward to describe similar experiences as well as a culture at the firm that looked the other way.
He also said last month that he had taken a leave for health reasons, not because of the accusations.
Mr. Meier, a winner of the Pritzker Prize, architecture’s top award, has designed noteworthy buildings like the Getty Center in Los Angeles. He is known as one of the world’s “starchitects,” along with major names like Frank Gehry and Rem Koolhaas.
Bernhard Karpf will now serve as the managing principal of the firm, and Vivian Lee, Reynolds Logan and Dukho Yeon have been promoted to principals. Michael Palladino, who has worked as a partner and principal designer at the firm for more than three decades, will continue to lead the West Coast activities with Jim Crawford.
