Do You Need a Pap Smear to Get Birth Control?
Why do many gynecologists require a pap smear be done in order to prescribe or renew prescriptions for hormonal birth control?
— asked by Tiffany Hamilton from Houston, Tex.
They shouldn’t. It is not recommended that cervical cancer screening and contraception be linked.
Back in the day the teaching was to make women come in for Pap smears in order to get their birth control pills. This was hopelessly patriarchal. While I don’t know for sure, I’m guessing some doctors had the idea that women couldn’t be trusted to look after their own reproductive health so they needed a carrot (the pill) to help them care for their cervix.
Insert angry emoji.
I suspect some doctors also linked cervical cancer screening and contraception for billing. If you refill birth control over the phone, most doctors are unable to bill for that time.
Cervical cancer screening and contraception are unrelated medically-speaking. Women deserve bodily autonomy so the two should not be linked. An annual exam is not needed to stay on the birth control pill, although a blood pressure check may be needed for some women. Refilling birth control pills over the phone is simply part of the job.

Even though you are not seeing your provider once a year for cervical cancer screening, make sure to update them on any changes in your health status. As far as birth control pills are concerned, it is especially important to let your doctor know about any new diagnosis of migraines, blood clots or high blood pressure, and any change in menstrual bleeding.
