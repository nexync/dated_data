A psychiatrist writes that the behavior of those with the power to unleash nuclear war should be monitored.
“Stumbling Toward Armageddon,” by Sergey Radchenko (Op-Ed, Oct. 9), frighteningly demonstrates how close we may have come in 1973 to a war between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Like those witnessing the behaviors of President Richard Nixon and the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, we need to be vigilant in monitoring the mental states of leaders who have the power to unleash nuclear catastrophe.
When I say “mental state,” I don’t mean psychiatric disorder. Having a treatable psychiatric disorder, like a physical one, is not a contraindication for job functioning. From the newly released documents, Mr. Radchenko notes that Nixon was drunk and Brezhnev was delirious from alcohol and sleeping pills.
Substance-induced delirium was preventing both leaders from thinking straight. Thankfully, people with sound thinking were near these leaders to help avert a nuclear world war.
The writer, a psychiatrist, is a former president of the New York County branch of the American Psychiatric Association.
