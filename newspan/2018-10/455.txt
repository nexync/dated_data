California wants the sun to power homes day and night.
With a measure signed by Gov. Jerry Brown, the state has made a new commitment of $800 million for clean-energy technologies including home storage. The goal is to capture electricity generated by solar panels during daylight hours to help keep the lights on after the sun goes down.
The funds increase the state incentives set aside for energy storage to more than $1 billion. The rebate money can be used for residential and commercial systems, including for schools, farms and businesses.
homeowners can expect to pay about $4,500 for the typical installed battery system. That figure is the out-of-pocket cost after a $3,500 state rebate and a federal tax credit worth $2,000.
About a third of the money has been set aside for low-income people to claim first.
The state funds the incentive program with a fee of about 50 cents a month added to utility customers’ bills.
The rebate offer follows Mr. Brown’s recent signing of another bill that mandates 100 percent carbon-free electricity in California by 2045. The effort to increase storage is seen as a critical step in reaching the carbon-free goals.
“This is a classic California nuts-and-bolts policy of how to build the dream,” said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the trade group.

A trip down Highway 1 meant self-discovery and a search through memory for a travel writer, whose drive down the coast was marked by childhood scenes and a renewed sense of self.
And California turned out to be a sanctuary, too. The 659 miles of highway are dynamic and complicated, a winding and sharp reminder that you don’t have to be born someplace for it to be home.
