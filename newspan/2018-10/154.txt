Who Else Will Turn Their Back on Saudi Arabia?
Many businesses are distancing themselves from Saudi Arabia amid the mysterious disappearance of a Saudi journalist in Turkey. But some companies are finding it hard to walk away from the oil-rich kingdom’s money.
Back story: The journalist Jamal Khashoggi vanished after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials say they have video and audio evidence proving he was killed and have released a stream of leaks suggesting that the royal court of Saudi Arabia ordered it.
• Richard Branson stopped talks to have Saudi funds invest $1 billion in his space companies.
• The lobbying firm Harbour Group said it would stop representing the Saudi Embassy in Washington.
• Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber said he would not attend the Future Investment Initiative, a conference scheduled to be hosted by the country later this month. It was a notable move, considering that the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund is a major investor in Uber and sits on its board.
• Others have also withdrawn from the conference. They include Robert Bakish of Viacom and the venture capitalist Steve Case, as well as news organizations The New York Times, The Economist, The Financial Times, CNN and CNBC.
The dilemma: Saudi Arabia — which has multibillion-dollar ties to Wall Street, Washington and Silicon Valley — is hard to walk away from. That has led some companies to walk a fine line: The New York Times reported on Thursday that both Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase both still planned to attend the conference.
What to watch: It’s unclear whether other high-profile speakers at the conference — such as Masayoshi Son of SoftBank and Larry Fink of BlackRock — still intend on going. Which other companies and prominent executives will decide that involvement with the Saudis isn’t worth potential bad press?
