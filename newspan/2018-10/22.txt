I greatly appreciated your Oct. 17 article about how the Trump administration’s policy toward Iran might be compromised by the Saudi assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It highlights the sheer irrationality of President Trump’s hostility toward Iran. Iran is being sanctioned although it has complied with an international arms control agreement.
Iran is hardly a beacon of human rights and is definitely meddlesome in the region, but compared with Saudi Arabia it’s a Jeffersonian democracy. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Saudi royal family will probably end up suffering few consequences for the murder of Mr. Khashoggi, while Iranians will continue to suffer because of the bizarre hatred the Trump administration and its supporters, and many in Congress, have for Iran.
The Islamic Revolution and the Iran hostage crisis were 39 years ago. It’s time to move on. Former President Barack Obama recognized this.
Iran could be very useful in helping resolve some of the intractable problems in the region, from Afghanistan to Syria. It can certainly play a far more constructive role than Saudi Arabia. Let’s remember that most of the 9/11 hijackers came from Saudi Arabia. None came from Iran.
