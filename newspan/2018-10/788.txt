Storm King Art Center has announced it will add its first site-specific commission to its collection in nearly a decade with a new work by Sarah Sze.
The piece, “Fallen Sky,” will be installed at the 500-acre sculpture park in 2020. It will join 10 other site-specific commissions, including works by Richard Serra and Maya Lin.
Rather than reaching for the heavens like many sculptures at Storm King, “Fallen Sky” will include a 36-foot diameter spherical cavity pressed into the earth. An envelope of mirrored stainless steel will give it a glistening veneer.
That boldness also comes across in the piece’s location.
“One of the things I love about Sarah Sze’s work is, often in her exhibitions, she finds unusual spaces in museums or wherever she’s working,” said John P. Stern, the president of Storm King.
While scouting the park’s lush landscape, Ms. Sze, 49, was drawn to a hollow near the base of Museum Hill. After consulting with curators, she learned that a tree had died there and that its trunk had left a bowl in the earth.
Ms. Sze, a 2003 MacArthur fellow and professor of visual arts at Columbia University, is known for employing everyday materials to create multimedia installations. Her work is held in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim and the Whitney Museum of Modern Art.
Over the years, she’s created several works that revolve around circularity, most notably planetariums and timekeepers. That theme continues with her upcoming exhibition in a round room at the Gagosian Gallery in Rome.
