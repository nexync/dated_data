ANAHEIM, Calif. — After another of his ho-hum heroics — this time a 10th-inning home run in the Yankees’ 4-3 victory over Los Angeles on Friday night — Didi Gregorius did something remarkable even for him.
He took a curtain call.
Such a gesture would have been perfunctory at Yankee Stadium, but with a ballpark 3,000 miles from the Bronx teeming with Yankees fans, he was happy to oblige when they began chanting his name after he had circled the bases.
