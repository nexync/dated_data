It’s often described as a crisis, but the despair on San Francisco’s streets is much more. Jim Wilson, the San Francisco bureau photographer, and I set out to document a single block to get a better sense of the desperate conditions in one of the richest cities in the United States.
We asked the statisticians at city hall to compile a list of blocks that received the most complaints about filth. The 300 block of Hyde Street topped the list. (Seven of the top 10 dirtiest streets were in the Tenderloin.) We spoke with residents, the unsheltered who huddle under blankets each night in the Tenderloin, Mayor London Breed and the police about their perspectives.
Hundreds of readers reacted to the article about the dirtiest block in San Francisco. Here are some of their responses. Tell us what you think at |||EMAIL_ADDRESS||| I want to make clear that this is not just an issue for the Tenderloin, which can always be dismissed as the “sketchy” part of town. I’ve lived in the Castro for 20 years and the homeless situation has been established in the last few years and continues to flourish.
Is your wonderful dog really as smart as you say?
A recent study published in the journal Learning & Behavior suggests the answer is probably not. In fact, the authors argue that dogs are no more exceptional than other animals when it comes to canniness and intelligence. They reviewed existing studies and data on animal cognition and found that while dogs are certainly smart and trainable, they are not “super smart,” despite what you might want to believe.
You can read more about the study here. But keep in mind: One of the study’s authors admits he is a cat person.
