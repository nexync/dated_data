Are There Activities You Used to Love That Are Now So Competitive They’re Not Fun Anymore?
Have extracurriculars and hobbies gotten so competitive they’re just not fun anymore? Have you found that you don’t want to participate in activities you once enjoyed — whether sports like soccer, arts like theater or music, or interests like debate — because you’re not willing or able to devote the time and money to become among the best at them?
— Do you agree with Mr. Wu that having hobbies — doing things solely because we enjoy them — is important? Why?
— The author writes, “For to permit yourself to do only that which you are good at is to be trapped in a cage whose bars are not steel but self-judgment.”  Do you have any regrets about that decision?
— Is there a competitiveness and intensity to some extracurriculars that detract from the joy of these activities? Explain.
— Are there activities you do simply because you enjoy them? Do you hope to continue with them when you’re an adult? Please share.
