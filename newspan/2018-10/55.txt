Reader Center|What Would You Tell Your 18-Year-Old Self?
We asked young women photographers to show us what 18-year-old girlhood looks like in their communities. Then we asked you. Here’s what Gloria Steinem, Hillary Clinton and other readers had to say.
For a project to document the lives of 18-year-old girls around the world, we asked readers to share their best advice for 18-year-old them. We heard from Hillary Clinton, Chelsea Handler and the Nobel Prize nominee Amanda Nguyen — as well as thousands of readers. From New Jersey to Argentina, here’s their best wisdom, along with photos of themselves at 18.
Want to share a photo of your own? It’s not too late! Post a photo of yourself at 18 on your favorite social media channel, along with what advice you’d give to the person in the photo. Use the hashtag #ThisIs18 and follow along on Instagram.
Don’t be afraid to defy convention.
“Women are powerful and can do whatever they want, but generally lipliner is not a good idea.” — Meena Harris, Oakland, Calif.
