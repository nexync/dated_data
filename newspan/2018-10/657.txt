MOSCOW — President Trump’s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said on Monday that he had directly criticized Russian officials for meddling in United States elections although, he said, their actions had not had any effect on electoral outcomes.
Mr. Bolton, who was in Moscow to discuss United States plans to withdraw from a nuclear disarmament treaty, told the Echo of Moscow radio station that election meddling came up during his meetings with senior officials, including the Russian foreign minister and the chief of the country’s security council.
Moscow’s meddling has strained relations with the United States and has prompted a special counsel investigation in Washington into whether members of Mr. Trump’s campaign team and administration colluded with the meddling or obstructed the investigation into it.
Mr. Bolton said he had been blunt with the Russians, according to a transcript of his interview, which the radio station translated into Russian for broadcast and posting on its website.
Mr. Bolton said Russians had been indicted in the United States for the election interference. “This coldblooded, blatant intrusion into the electoral process will be discussed with American legal entities,” he said.
Mr. Bolton traveled to Moscow after Mr. Trump said on Saturday that the United States would withdraw from a nuclear disarmament treaty, the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Mr. Trump said the reason for the withdrawal was Russia’s violation of the agreement and the fact that China was not a signatory.
In the interview, Mr. Bolton said the United States would now consult with allies in Europe, who have opposed the withdrawal from the treaty, considered a cornerstone of the nuclear disarmament agreements reached in the final months of the Soviet Union. Mr. Bolton said the treaty was now outdated as countries other than Russia and the United States were capable of developing intermediate range missiles.
