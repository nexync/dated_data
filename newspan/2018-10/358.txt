The highly unusual rebuke by Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, came a week before the midterm elections — but after years of incendiary and racially charged comments by Mr. King, capped in recent days by his endorsement of a white nationalist running for mayor of Toronto and a meeting with Austrian white nationalists, which he funded through a trip to visit concentration camps.
Mr. King is also locked in the toughest re-election fight of his eight-term House career.
New polling from Iowa’s Fourth Congressional District indicates that he is in a statistical tie with his Democratic opponent, J. D. Scholten, a former baseball player and a first-time candidate, who has significantly outraised him. Iowa Republicans are already at risk of losing two other House seats.
Over nearly 16 years, Mr. King has evolved from a stalwart conservative to a vocal opponent of immigration to the edge of white supremacy. He compared immigrants to dogs and said young migrants had “calves the size of cantaloupes” because they were hauling in bales of marijuana. He once tweeted a political cartoon depicting President Barack Obama wearing a turban.
But the tipping point may have come last week when news reports revealed that Mr. King had met in August with members of an Austrian political party associated with neo-Nazi movements while he was on a trip to Holocaust sites that was funded by a Holocaust memorial charity, From the Depths.
His local newspaper, The Sioux City Journal, which had endorsed Mr. King in previous races, instead endorsed Mr. Scholten.
