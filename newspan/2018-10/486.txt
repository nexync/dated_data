An environmentalist says companies must be held accountable for plastics pollution.
With roughly eight million metric tons of plastic entering the ocean each year, it’s no surprise that more than half of sea turtles worldwide have eaten plastic. But they’re not alone.
Plastic is affecting everything from zooplankton and fish to marine mammals and seabirds. It’s even making its way into the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe.
Recycling is not enough to solve the plastics crisis. Only 9 percent of all the plastic produced has been recycled. If we want to have an impact, we must hold companies accountable for reducing the amount of single-use plastic they are dumping into our environment.
