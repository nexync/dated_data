GLENDALE, Ariz. — Emmanuel Sanders threw and caught touchdown passes, Denver returned two interceptions for first-quarter touchdowns, and the Broncos ended a four-game losing streak with a 45-10 rout of the Arizona Cardinals on Thursday night.
Todd Davis returned the rookie Josh Rosen’s deflected pass for a touchdown on the second play of the game, and Chris Harris Jr. took another back 53 yards for a score with 2 minutes 2 seconds left in the first quarter as the Broncos (3-4) opened a 21-3 lead.
Rosen threw three interceptions and fumbled the ball away twice on a rough night that began badly for him and never got better. He limped off the field after he was sacked for the fifth time, on a fourth-and-16 play near the end of the game.
The Cardinals (1-6), down by 35-3 at the half, fell to 0-4 at home for the first time since 1979.
Case Keenum completed 14 of 21 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown, with one interception, for the Broncos. Phillip Lindsay rushed for 90 yards on 14 carries, including a 28-yard touchdown run.
Rosen called a timeout after the game’s first play. His pass was then deflected by defensive end Derek Wolfe. The ball dropped into the hands of Davis, who ran it in.
Arizona followed with a three and out, and the Broncos quickly made it 14-0 with a six-play, 77-yard drive. Sanders took the ball on an end around and threw 28 yards to a wide-open Courtland Sutton for the touchdown.
A receiver may have run the wrong route on Rosen’s second interception for a touchdown. On third-and-one from the Arizona 46, Rosen passed, but there was no one near the ball except Harris, who returned it 53 yards to make it 21-3.
The Broncos made it 28-3 in the second quarter when Keenum found Sanders wide open on a 64-yard touchdown play.
A pass-interference call against Bene Benwikere in the end zone set up a 1-yard touchdown run by Royce Freeman that made it 35-3 with 21 seconds left in the half. The run capped a 15-play, 70-yard drive that used up 6:39.
