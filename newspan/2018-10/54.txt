• What went wrong in Indonesia?
As the death toll continues to rise on Sulawesi Island — to 1,407 on Wednesday — officials are trying to understand why an early warning system for earthquakes and tsunamis failed to protect the island.
The system was set up in 2008, with seismographic sensors, buoys and tidal gauges.
But a combination of vandalism, maintenance shortfalls and infrastructure damaged by the earthquake meant residents didn’t receive enough warning to evacuate.
• The F.B.I. completes its Kavanaugh report.
Early Thursday, the White House sent the Senate the completed F.B.I. investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, saying it was “confident” that he would be confirmed to the court.
The White House issued its statement around 2:30 a.m., just hours after Senate Republicans moved to schedule a vote on Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.
Republicans are also stepping up efforts to challenge the veracity of Christine Blasey Ford, Judge Kavanaugh’s main accuser, confronting her with a sworn statement from a former boyfriend who questioned some of her testimony last week.
But those attacks, along with President Trump’s mockery of Dr. Blasey at a campaign rally, could complicate the party’s efforts to confirm Judge Kavanaugh by alienating three key Republican senators, Jeff Flake, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. All three condemned the president’s remarks about Dr. Blasey.
In the meantime, more than 1,000 law professors signed a letter to the Senate saying that Judge Kavanaugh did not have the “judicial temperament” for the court. It was published by Times Opinion.
• A U.N. court rebukes the U.S. over its Iran sanctions.
The International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s highest court, ordered the U.S. to ease sanctions against Iran. Rulings by the court are legally binding, but it has no way of enforcing them.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wasted no time responding, announcing in a largely symbolic move that the U.S. was canceling a 1955 treaty that was the basis for friendly diplomatic exchanges and economic relations with Iran, long before its Islamic revolution turned the two nations into enemies.

• A French “escape king” is captured.
The escape scene unfolded like a top-notch thriller. Armed men hijacked a helicopter and swept into a French prison yard in July, scooping up Rédoine Faïd, a notorious inmate serving a 25-year sentence for a robbery that left a police officer dead.
But now, after an intensive manhunt, Mr. Faïd is back in custody. Above, the apartment building outside Paris where he was arrested.
Although no one disputed he had done bad things — this was Mr. Faïd’s second prison break — he has gained a somewhat mythical status. Even detectives admit that he is far from an ordinary criminal.

• NASA’s Parker Solar Probe, which will get closer to the sun than any other spacecraft, is named after Eugene Parker, 91, whose ideas about the sun 60 years ago were wrongly dismissed.
Told he had the wrong person, the man punched and kicked Mr. Rather, still yelling the question. Mr. Rather dashed into a building and was rescued by a doorman and building superintendent.
The police chalked it up to mistaken identity. Some people wondered if Mr. Rather had imagined it. It was unclear if one or two men had attacked.
Meanwhile, “What’s the frequency, Kenneth?” became a U.S. pop catchphrase. The band R.E.M. wrote a song by that name.
In 1997, it emerged that William Tager, a North Carolina man in prison by then, was Mr. Rather’s assailant. In 1994, Mr. Tager had shot and killed a television stagehand, saying the media was beaming messages into his brain. Shown photos, Mr. Rather recognized him.
Mr. Tager was released from prison in 2010. His whereabouts is unknown.
