Your smartphone knows much more about wine than you do, maybe even more than an expert like Hugh Johnson. That’s because the Vinous app and website, created by Antonio Galloni in 2013 after he left Robert Parker’s Wine Advocate, has just scooped up two other free apps, Delectable and Banquet, to enhance its wine coverage. Scan a wine label, and Delectable will give you reviews by a cross section of wine drinkers, both amateur and professional, like sommeliers, not just the opinions by wine critics that you’d find for 170,000 wines on Vinous. Delectable’s database covers more than a million choices, for spirits and beer too, with comments from some 4.6 million users. Banquet will tell you where to buy the bottles. Shops pay a fee to be listed.
