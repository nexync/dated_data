The Stone, an influential East Village performance space owned by the composer-improviser John Zorn, appears to have announced its end date — in February of 2018. The club’s calendar for that month, which includes a “Farewell to the Stone” celebration, was singled out on Monday in the Twitter feed of Destination: Out, a two-person team of advocates of avant-garde jazz.
In an emailed statement, Mr. Zorn confirmed the timing of the closure, but added that a future was likely for the Stone in another space. “We hope to secure a new location and discussions are proceeding, but as yet nothing has been definitely decided,” he wrote.
Since Mr. Zorn opened the Stone in 2005, it has been a stalwart home for experimental music in almost every form. Operating as a nonprofit, it serves no food or drinks, and typically features musicians in weeklong residencies, presenting a range of projects over the course of each run. The format will be changing in the new year, with one set of music a night, at 9 p.m., rather than the longstanding policy of two sets, at 8 and 10 p.m.
Mr. Zorn will be a fixture at the Stone this week. He is scheduled to lead a customary end-of-the-year improv extravaganza on Thursday and Friday nights, with colleagues like Ikue Mori (on electronics) and Okkyung Lee (on cello). And he’ll perform in two special sets on Saturday, for New Year’s Eve: at 8 p.m. with Ms. Mori, Ms. Lee and the guitarist Thurston Moore; and at 11 p.m. with the bassist Bill Laswell, the drummer Milford Graves and the saxophonist Steve Coleman.
