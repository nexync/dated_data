“Can I Go to Great Books Camp?,” by Molly Worthen (Sunday Review, Dec. 4), drew important attention to several political philosophy and policy programs, including the Hertog Program, which I attended in 2011. But the portrayal of these programs as “echo chambers” and “safe spaces for conservatives who think little has changed since William F. Buckley” is misleading.
While most students probably fell into the conservative tent, broadly defined, Hertog participants represented a diverse array of political identities: social conservatives, moderate Republicans, libertarians, foreign policy hawks, independents and, yes, even Democrats.
Moreover, in the policy section, students were required to participate in debates featuring both sides of important issues, from the Affordable Care Act to intervention in Iran.
Above all, the program encouraged critical thinking and dialogue. Not mentioning this aspect of the program risks undercutting one of its principal achievements: creating a network of young professionals who may disagree on a range of intellectual and political issues but nevertheless seek serious and informed discussion.
Such programs do not just benefit a diverse Republican Party; they also benefit our country.
