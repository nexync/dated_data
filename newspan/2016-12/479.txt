This Week in Hate tracks hate crimes and harassment around the country since the election of Donald Trump. The Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups are keeping detailed counts of harassment and abuse. We will regularly present a selection of incidents to show the scope of the problem.
• The home in Moonachie, N.J., of Nikita Whitlock, a fullback for the New York Giants, was vandalized last Tuesday night with swastikas, the phrase “KKK” and the word “Trump.” Police are investigating the vandalism as a hate crime.
• Brandon Marshall, a Denver Broncos linebacker who had knelt during the national anthem at games this season, received a threatening letter full of racial slurs last week. “We are ‘channeling’ a devastating hard hit for you,” the sender wrote. “Something to make you an invalid in a wheel chair.” The security staff of the Broncos is investigating the letter.
• Ilhan Omar, a newly elected Minnesota state representative and the country’s first Somali-American legislator, was harassed last Tuesday by a cab driver in Washington, D.C. He called her “ISIS” and threatened to remove her hijab. Ms. Omar was in Washington to attend a planning session for Democrats at the White House.
• Last Tuesday and Wednesday, the staff at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, a public high school in Cambridge, Mass., found three swastikas drawn in boys’ bathrooms.
• A man was stabbed near a mosque in Simi Valley, Calif. on Saturday night. One man has been arrested on suspicion of a hate crime in the incident, and police are looking for another suspect. The victim was reportedly in stable condition on Monday.
• The actor T.J. Miller was arrested on Friday after allegedly hitting an Uber driver in an argument over Donald Trump. Mr. Miller has been critical of Mr. Trump in the past; during an October television appearance, he attempted to burn a Trump-brand tie.
• On Saturday morning, police were called to a Korean Presbyterian church in Buena Park, Calif., to investigate swastikas painted on a wall.
• Last Friday, a student at Nassau Community College on Long Island notified security of swastikas and the words “Germany” and “Heil Hitler” drawn in a men’s restroom. A security guard had found separate swastikas in a stairwell and on a wall last Wednesday, and three other incidents of anti-Semitic graffiti were reported in October.
• A resident of Greenwood, Ind., notified police on Tuesday that a racial slur had been spray-painted on the side of his house. He had also received a note stating that his family were not welcome and that this was “Trump country.” The incident has been reported to the FBI as a possible hate crime.
 Islam prohibits pork consumption, and the Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations is asking the F.B.I. to investigate the incident as a hate crime.
