As Jim Dwyer pointed out, New Yorkâ€™s failure to legislatively require the police to videotape custodial interrogations puts all New Yorkers at risk: When the wrong person is convicted of a crime, the real perpetrator is allowed to remain free and commit other crimes.
Nearly half of the country (but not New York) mandates the recording of interrogations through legislation or court action. That New York does not is particularly disturbing, as its rate of false confessions far exceeds the national average.
The New York Police Department claimed at a recent City Council hearing that it now records interrogations in full, but two judges provided testimony at that hearing showing otherwise. The only way to guarantee police compliance is through adoption of a state law.
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has long supported such a law. We urge him now to convene the stakeholders (law enforcement, prosecutors and defense lawyers) and, together with other Albany lawmakers, enact a law that has been demonstrably shown to prevent wrongful convictions.
Further delays and inertia in Albany promise that more New Yorkers will suffer from the horror of wrongful conviction.
