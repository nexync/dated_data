The body of George Michael, the British pop star who died on Sunday at 53, was discovered on Christmas Day by his boyfriend, Fadi Fawaz, at the singer’s home in the village of Goring-on-Thames, according to an account published on Tuesday by The Daily Telegraph.
Michael Lippman, Mr. Michael’s manager, said on Sunday that the singer, who had struggled with drugs and depression for years, died from heart failure. An initial police statement called the death “unexplained but not suspicious”; the authorities could not be reached for comment on Tuesday and the local coroner’s office was closed.
