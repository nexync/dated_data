An article on Nov. 26 about a diaspora of poorer Venezuelans fleeing poverty and hunger omitted the names of two of the three Caribbean islands that a fleet of the Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard patrols for refugees. Besides Curaçao, the fleet also patrols Aruba and Bonaire. In addition, the article paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Rob Jurriansen, a coast guard officer who heads the fleet. Mr. Jurriansen said his fleet had intercepted just 5 percent to 10 percent of the illegal immigrants — not boats — coming to those three islands from all countries, not only Venezuela.
