We asked some of this year’s notable writers, actors and showrunners about the TV they enjoyed most in 2016. Come back to Watching, The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site, to read them all.
The best episode of TV this year was “Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.” Though it aired in March, it bore an uncanny resemblance to the end of 2016: Public scrutiny of a successful woman. A hotshot man hell-bent on defeating her. It even featured a crotch-grab. The opening account of O. J. grabbing Nicole’s crotch primes us for the misogyny this episode confronts. He grabs, claims ownership of, and then reduces Nicole’s self worth to the biological function of a body part. Marcia Clark is the woman advocating for Nicole, while sacrificing aspects of her own life to do so. She’s then criticized, mocked and punished for it. And it hurts. That’s what makes this episode great: that we see her hurt. That a female public figure can exist as both capable and hurt. That shouldn’t be groundbreaking, and yet.... The 2016 TV news cycle capitalized on coarse spectacle — but “Marcia, Marcia, Marcia” examines the private spaces of a public figure. By making Marcia’s story whole, it engages our empathy, informing the choices we make in our politics and in our lives. It’s not only the best episode, but the best of what TV can do for us.
