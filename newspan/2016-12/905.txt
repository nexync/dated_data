An local investor has bought this 6,375-square-foot five-story brick-and-brownstone rowhouse with a basement, facing Tompkins Square Park, in the East 10th Street Historic District in the East Village. This 25-foot-wide Greek Revival house, designed by Joseph Trench as a single-family house in 1844, features five market-rate floor-throughs, of which three are occupied, and a large garden in back.

A Mexican restaurant and bar, which received three rent-free months for its build-out, has signed a 10-year lease for a 900-square-foot ground floor space, and a basement of equal size, in this four-story mixed-use walk-up. It expects to open in March.
Landlord: 497 Atlantic Avenue Brooklyn Realty L.L.C.
A 10-year lease, with no key money required, is available for a 2,000-square-foot ground floor space in this recently gut-renovated luxury seven-story mixed-use Lower East Side elevator building, once the site of a 19th-century livery stable. It also features a 1,270-square-foot usable lower level and an 800-square-foot garden. The owner would vent the space for a restaurant and help build it out.
