The death of John Glenn has resurfaced memories of his famous orbit of Earth in 1962. Back then, there wasn’t much debris to block his view or threaten his spacecraft.
Humans have created millions of pieces of so-called “space junk” during the past 60 years of space exploration. While most are less than 10 centimeters in diameter, even tiny objects can threaten spacecrafts and communications satellites.
“Going at 17,500 miles per hour, a little marble can wipe out a space station,” said John Crassidis, an University at Buffalo engineering professor.
When bits of junk collide, they often break apart, creating more debris. Adding to the clutter are the abundance of satellites technology companies are launching these days.
NASA has called for stronger international regulations. “It’s a political mess,” Dr. Crassidis said.
Japan, though, is stepping forward to confront the challenge.
Last week its national space agency launched a spacecraft featuring a 700-meter cable that can safely guide debris into Earth’s atmosphere.
If the mission works, it could lead to more innovative approaches, like one a Japanese entrepreneur, above, recently discussed with The Times. He wants his company to be the leader in extraterrestrial trash collection.
Its slogan: Space Sweepers.
