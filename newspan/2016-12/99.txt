The Patriots won their first game after losing the Pro Bowl tight end Rob Gronkowski to a season-ending back injury, beating the hapless Rams last week. But they would do well to temper their enthusiasm until after they face the Ravens’ impregnable defense. No one runs the ball through Baltimore’s No. 1-ranked rush defense, so why should Patriots Coach Bill Belichick bother when he knows that quarterback Tom Brady can pick apart the middle with short throws and quick releases? The Ravens must win to keep pace with the Pittsburgh Steelers atop the A.F.C. North.
