Since last summer, what have you heard or read about Russian spies hacking into America’s computer systems to steal documents? What do you know about the suspicion that Russian hackers might have tampered with the U.S. presidential election?
Talk with a classmate about what you know, and compare notes.
1. What have American intelligence agencies concluded with “high confidence” about the recent presidential campaign? On what did they base their conclusion?
2. What do intelligence officials believe the Russian hackers did with the documents they are suspected of taking from the Democratic Party computer systems? In what ways might this have influenced the outcome of the presidential election?
3. What did President-elect Donald J. Trump say in response to the news? What do intelligence officials know for certain? What do they know based on broad circumstantial evidence? What questions remain?
4. What does President Barack Obama want done before he leaves office Jan. 20? What is the purpose of his request?
5. What did Representative Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, say on CNN in September? Why do you think he withdrew the claims quickly? Why did the Republican National Committee deny the possibility of what he had suggested.
Why do you think the Russian hackers would break into the computer files of the Republican National Committee and the Democratic Party? Do you think the hackers’ actions had any influence in swaying the outcome of the presidential election? Why or why not?
If you believe the evidence points to election tampering, what should happen next? Will you follow this story as it unfolds over the next few months?
