I stared vacantly out the grimy subway window, clutching a pole on a Manhattan-bound F train during my morning commute. Somewhere between the Roosevelt Avenue and 21st Street-Queensbridge stations, my feelings caught up with me, and I began to cry silently. Surreptitiously, I wiped at my tears, hoping that no one would notice.
At 21st Street, the doors opened and closed, but the train remained in the station. “Train traffic ahead!” came the announcement.
My fellow commuters made their frustrations audible, but I was grateful for a few extra minutes to collect myself before the subway crawled into Manhattan.
As I contemplated how to politely but breezily say, “Good morning,” and run past my colleagues so that they wouldn’t notice my tear-stained face, I caught the eye of a man waiting on the platform. He smiled reassuringly and nodded.
I quickly wiped my cheeks again, but it was obvious he had already noticed my tears. He made a silly face, and the unexpectedness of it made me smile.  He gestured toward his friends — a small group of 30-something men and women — and they joined in, making clown faces and sticking out their tongues.
We all probably looked like fools: them with their silly faces, me with my blotchy skin and puffy eyes, laughing suddenly and loudly in a quiet subway car. But in that moment, I had never felt such gratitude for three little words.
Train traffic ahead!
