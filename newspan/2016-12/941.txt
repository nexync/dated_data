For the past few years, the pastry chef Dominique Ansel has been concocting what he calls Christmas Morning Cereal, which can also be sprinkled over ice cream or nibbled on the sly. It resembles the offspring of granola and Cocoa Krispies: a devilish mix of clumps of puffed rice covered in caramelized milk chocolate, candied hazelnuts and meringue drops. It’s available again in Mr. Ansel’s SoHo store, and can be ordered online for pickup and, for that far-flung sweet tooth, for delivery in the continental United States: Christmas Morning Cereal, $15.50 at Dominique Ansel Bakery, 189 Spring Street (Thompson Street), |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , or from dominiqueansel.com/christmas-cereal-shipping; orders must be received by Friday for shipping the next Monday, minimum three boxes with a shipping charge of $3 per box.
