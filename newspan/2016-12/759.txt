This weekend, thousands of red-suited revelers will be riding their sleighs pedal-to-the-metal into New York City for SantaCon, an enormous pub-crawl.
The city has a love-hate relationship with the booze-infused day. So do local bars, where we were told that the SantaCon shenanigans often surpass even those of St. Patrick’s Day and New Year’s Eve.
While the event’s organizers do offer rules of conduct for participants — “Santa spreads joy. Not terror. Not vomit. Not trash.” — your neighborhood bartenders have some requests, too.
“Don’t do it,” said Scott Ackerman of the Grafton, suggesting you give the event a miss.
Santas will also be turned away at Phebe’s.
“People get sick or do things they shouldn’t be doing indoors,” said Eleni Angeles, a bartender there.
“Hold onto your stuff, because so much gets stolen,” said Melissa Gratto, who has worked SantaCon at Feile and Stout.
Above all, here’s what we heard over and over again: Please, be respectful.
It will feel as if it were below freezing (as low as 20 degrees), and the gusts will probably be enough to make you gasp.
We haven’t tired of snow yet, so the chance of scattered flurries is making us feel warm and fuzzy. But that’s only on the inside.
Winter coat watch: No doubt.

We might see snow this weekend, and temperatures won’t make it out of the 30s. But in one part of the city, it’s summertime.
If you can be coaxed out of your chrysalis of winter clothing, you’ll find 500 butterflies floating through tropical, 80-degree weather, a rain forest canopy and simulated sunlight on the Upper West Side.
The fluttering visitors — including zebra longwings, owl butterflies, paper kites and monarchs — have arrived at the American Museum of Natural History’s Butterfly Conservatory, which opens tomorrow, from as far away as Australia, Kenya, Malaysia and Thailand.
You can visit the exhibition to learn more, not only about these exotic butterflies but also about some that are native New Yorkers.
