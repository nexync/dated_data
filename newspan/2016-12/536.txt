Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into The New York Times. In this article, The Times photographer Doug Mills shares notes on, and photographs from, his travels with the president-elect.
The press pool does not travel on the same plane as President-elect Trump, so the 13-member press pool flew on a small Gulf Stream aircraft ahead of Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump’s senior strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner descended from the rear of the president-elect’s plane just moments before Mr. Trump and Mike Pence, the vice president-elect, did.
We began our day at the Carrier plant in Indiana. Workers busily attended to the production of air conditioner units while Mr. Trump toured the plant with local officials. Workers yelled and cheered as the President-elect walked through, inspecting their handiwork and speaking with workers. Mr. Trump seemed eager to wade into the crowd of workers that gathered at the end of his tour and derived evident energy from their attention.
Following the Carrier tour, Mr. Trump addressed the crowd, and then we were off to Ohio for his first post-election rally.
The President-elect’s motorcade arrived at the arena ahead of schedule. The crowd, though, was late arriving — and the arena never filled. Mr. Trump’s staff told us just before 7 p.m. that the event was delayed because of road and bridge closures. When the president-elect took the stage around 7:45 p.m., hundreds of seats remained empty.
Traveling press photographers are normally allowed into the “buffer zone” around the stage for photos and video, but not this time.
