My first taste of a dark, lavish lièvre à la royale, or royal hare, was years ago at an elegant little restaurant, Au Plaisir Gourmand, in Chinon, in France’s Loire Valley. I’ve enjoyed the incomparably rich and meaty dish since, at Le Grand Véfour in Paris and at Daniel in New York. It’s made from the meat of the hare, stuffed with pork jowl, foie gras, the hare’s innards, and its blood, and even chocolate. Lately, it seems to have become an inspiration for chefs. At Osteria Francescana in Modena, Italy, Massimo Bottura, the chef, has based a dessert on it, even including a layer of foie gras. “It has all the spices and encompasses everything in every taste,” Mr. Bottura said. In New York, Frédéric Duca, the chef at Racines NY, is preparing a limited number of portions through the end of the month. It takes him at least three days of boning, marinating, stuffing, poaching and saucing two big hares to make about 20 portions, which gleam in a cloak of mahogany sauce: Lièvre à la royale, $60 a portion (call ahead for availability), Racines NY, 94 Chambers Street (Church Street), |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , racinesny.com.
