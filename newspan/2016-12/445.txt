There are nicely wrought seasonal recipes in this lavish book about Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons near Oxford, England, written by its chef and owner, Raymond Blanc. Born in France and self taught, he opened the Manoir in Great Milton in 1984, and has used its 27 acres to grow fresh vegetables, berries and herbs for his kitchen. Over time, Mr. Blanc’s cooking, which has earned two Michelin stars, has evolved, with a broader, global palette of seasonings. But what makes this beautifully illustrated volume more than just a gift-worthy showpiece is that many of the recipes should inspire a home cook. Try chicken with morels, asparagus with chervil, salmon with spinach and watercress, poached egg on tomato fondue, Jerusalem artichoke soup, hake Grenobloise, and more: “Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons: The Story of a Modern Classic” by Raymond Blanc (Bloomsbury, $75).
