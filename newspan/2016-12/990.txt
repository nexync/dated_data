CALL them boomerang retirees: people who exit gracefully after their career at a company, then return shortly afterward to work there part time.
Mark Keefe, who spent his career as a human resources manager at Overlook Medical Center in Summit, N.J., retired in 2014, when he was 66. Since his wife still worked, he took on household chores and cooked the evening meals. “It was really a time to relax,” he said.
Starting in March of 2015, Mr. Keefe began putting on a suit and tie and returning to work every Wednesday. He taps his human resources experience to counsel employees who are nearing retirement about benefit packages.
Beulah Webb, 59, retired in December 2015, after working 30 years on various assembly line jobs at Michelin North America’s rubber-mixing facility in Sandy Springs, S.C. Through the tire manufacturer’s 11-year-old Returning Retiree Employee program, she puts in roughly 30 hours a week as a facility training manager.
The public sector also has its boomerangs. California and many states offer public employee retirees the opportunity to come back part time. The federal government has recently been rolling out a phased retirement program; workers can cut back on their hours and continue to earn additional retirement benefits.
Human resource professionals predict that the number of boomerang retiree programs will expand, especially among larger companies with deep pockets. Older workers are the largest collection of talent on payroll, a deep well of skill to tap at a time when management routinely complains about skill shortages. The talents of recent retirees are well known to managers, while former employees are comfortable with an organization’s culture.
