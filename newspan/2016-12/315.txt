Daniel Nearing, a Chicago-based microbudget director, is not the most accessible filmmaker, but with his new feature and his previous one, he has carved out an original and boldly unfashionable niche. His interests are unabashedly literary: “Chicago Heights,” from 2009, was inspired by Sherwood Anderson’s “Winesburg, Ohio.” Now Anderson and Ernest Hemingway appear as supporting characters in “Hogtown,” the second film in a planned trilogy.
The movie unfolds in loosely connected vignettes, with a mix of narrators and narrative tenses; it can feel as if you’re leafing through a collection of poems. The plot revolves around the disappearance and possible murder of a theater-chain magnate, based on a real figure, as well as the personal life of a detective (Herman Wilkins) on the case. But the film also tries to excavate a time and place, evoking the lives of the city’s immigrant and marginalized residents and its 1919 race riots as well as its snowfalls, speakeasies and slaughterhouses.
As in the little-seen “Chicago Heights,” the acting and production values can be creaky, and the more cryptic references cry out for annotation. Yet Mr. Nearing’s experimentation doesn’t squelch the throwback aura. “Hogtown” plays like a find from a forgotten archive.
