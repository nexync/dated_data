My husband and I, World War II survivors from Poland, arrived in New York on March 16, 1948, on a dilapidated transport ship. We were taken to the Latham Hotel at 28th Street and Fifth Avenue. The next morning, my husband, an avid photographer, woke me with a kiss. He was dressed and off to take pictures. “President Truman will be in New York,” he said, “and I must take photos.” Then he was quickly out the door.
“It is my first day in America,” I thought. “I must see President Truman in person.” Wanting to look elegant, I put on a dress, plus clothes I had picked out from the American Red Cross in Bremen, Germany: a fur-lined housecoat, high heels and a hat with a long pheasant feather.
Knowing little English, I asked in the hotel lobby if anyone spoke French or German. A woman answered in German. She said President Truman would be reviewing the St. Patrick’s Day parade, and told me to go to the library on 42nd Street. Negotiating my way through the crowds, I began to sweat. I became confused: The street was totally empty. So I went around the barriers and walked freely on Fifth Avenue. Suddenly I heard clop, clop, clop and a stern voice. “Where do you think you are going?” It was a police officer on a horse.
