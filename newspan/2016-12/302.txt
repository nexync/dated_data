Shane Prince, Brock Nelson and Jason Chimera produced three goals in less than four and a half minutes of the third period on Thursday night, leading the Islanders to their first three-game winning streak of the season with a 3-0 victory over the host Washington Capitals.
Islanders goalie Jaroslav Halak — who briefly played for the Capitals in 2014 — made 38 saves for his first shutout of the season and the 40th of his N.H.L. career.
The Islanders entered with the fewest points in the Eastern Conference, including just one victory in eight road games, and were playing the second half of a back-to-back, while the Capitals were coming off a four-day break.
EICHEL HELPS SABRES EDGE RANGERS Jack Eichel scored two goals in the third period, and the Buffalo Sabres beat the visiting Rangers, 4-3, for their second straight victory.

The Devils’ Travis Zajac scored his third goal of the game at 8:49 of the third to tie it at 3-3 after scores by Chicago’s Artem Anisimov and Niklas Hjalmarsson late in the second period had put the Blackhawks ahead.
After slow starts in his last two tournaments, Adam Scott wanted to play the first round of the Australian PGA Championship like it was his last.
He finished below par after the first round this trip Down Under for the first time.
Scott, the 2013 champion, closed with three birdies for a four-under-par 68 at the Royal Pines Resort in Gold Coast and was three shots behind the leaders Andrew Dodt, Harold Varner and Ashley Hall after the opening round was interrupted by rain.
Dodt and Scott were in the half of the field that finished Thursday before lightning and a storm forced organizers to postpone play until Friday morning.
Play resumed at 5:30 a.m. local time, and Varner completed his first round on Friday with birdies on his last two holes. Hall birdied four of his last seven holes.

Brook Lopez scored 15 points, Sean Kilpatrick had 14, and Bojan Bogdanovic added 13 for the Nets.
Nascar announced that Monster Energy would take over as title sponsor of its top series in 2017, ending a lengthy process of finding a replacement for Sprint.
It was not immediately announced what Monster Beverage Corporation, which is based in Corona, Calif., would pay for the naming rights deal or how long the agreement would run.
Nascar’s chairman, Brian France, made the announcement at the Wynn Las Vegas, site of Friday’s season-ending awards banquet.
The cellular company Sprint ended its 13-year run as title sponsor when the 2016 season ended last month with Jimmie Johnson winning his record-tying seventh series title.
The announcement gives Nascar and Monster a little more than two months to prepare for the start of the 2017 season, which begins with the Daytona 500 on Feb. 26.
