BOSTON â€” The Red Sox have traded the right-hander Clay Buchholz to the Philadelphia Phillies for the minor league second baseman Josh Tobias.
Buchholz was the odd man out in a Boston rotation that added Chris Sale this off-season.
Buchholz, 32, pitched a no-hitter in 2007 in his second major league game. He is a two-time All-Star, but he has been inconsistent in his career. In all, he is 81-61 with a 3.96 earned run average in parts of 10 big-league seasons. He was 8-10 with a 4.78 E.R.A. this year.
Tobias, 24, has hit .301 in 188 minor league games since being selected by the Phillies in the 10th round of the 2015 amateur draft.
