Charlie Strong, who was fired by Texas late last month, was hired Sunday to be the football coach at South Florida, returning to a region where he has deep roots and a conference where he has won championships.
Strong was let go on Nov. 26, the day after he coached his final game with the Longhorns. With the 25th-ranked Bulls, he will replace Willie Taggart, who left South Florida to become the coach at Oregon only a few days ago.
The Bulls, based in Tampa, went 10-2 this season and finished second in the American Athletic Conference’s East division behind Temple, which won the league’s championship game.
Strong compiled a 16-21 record with no winning seasons in three years at Texas after replacing Mack Brown. Before going to Texas, Strong was 37-15 in four years at Louisville, including a 23-3 record in his final two seasons.
The Cardinals were in the Big East and the A.A.C. when Strong was their coach, and they won at least a share of two league championships under his guidance.
Strong, 56, has strong ties to the state of Florida. He spent 13 seasons as an assistant coach at the University of Florida under Steve Spurrier, Ron Zook and Urban Meyer, mostly as the Gators’ defensive coordinator. He also was the defensive coordinator at South Carolina from 1999 to 2002.
