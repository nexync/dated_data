SEOUL, South Korea — The South Korean Parliament has voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye, which suspends her from office while the Constitutional Court decides whether to formally remove her. These are some of the contenders to replace her, and one who will take her place temporarily.
As the No. 2 official in government, Mr. Hwang will serve as acting president while Ms. Park is suspended. A staunch defender of Ms. Park and perhaps the second least popular official in government, there is little chance he would be more than a caretaker until the court decides to reinstate Ms. Park or an election is held for her successor. A former prosecutor, he was first appointed by Ms. Park as her justice minister, a position he used to dismantle a small, left-wing party on charges of subscribing to North Korean ideology.
As the likely presidential candidate of the main opposition party, the liberal Mr. Moon tops opinion surveys of potential replacements for Ms. Park. As a student activist in the 1970s, Mr. Moon was jailed for opposing the dictatorship of Ms. Park’s father, President Park Chung-hee. He had been a friend and ally of President Roh Moo-hyun since the 1980s, when they worked together as human rights lawyers defending students and labor activists persecuted under the military dictatorship. When Mr. Roh became president, Mr. Moon became his chief of staff. Mr. Moon ran for president in 2012, losing narrowly to Ms. Park, which his supporters say was partly because of a clandestine smear campaign by the government’s main intelligence agency.
Mr. Moon supports the country’s alliance with Washington, but he has argued that it needs a more “balanced diplomacy” with the United States and China. His party has criticized the current approach on North Korea, saying sanctions alone will not end the North’s nuclear weapons program. Many of its members have opposed Ms. Park’s decision to deploy an American missile defense battery in South Korea. Mr. Moon has not said whether he would reverse the decision if he became president but has said it should be subject to parliamentary approval.
The departing secretary general is popular in South Korea and is widely expected to declare his presidential ambition after his term at the United Nations ends on Dec. 31. There has been speculation that one reason Ms. Park has refused to step down immediately is to give Mr. Ban, a conservative, time to prepare for an election while preventing a progressive like Mr. Moon from taking power. Mr. Ban was a career South Korean diplomat before winning the top United Nations post in 2007, a momentous event for South Koreans who saw it as an affirmation of the country’s rising stature. He is considered a supporter of the partnership with the United States but has not commented on specific South Korean policies. He is also untested in the cut-and-thrust world of electoral politics. Another obstacle: He has no party affiliation. He had been expected to join Ms. Park’s party, Saenuri, but its popularity has plunged in the wake of her scandal. He is now expected to form an alliance with some members of her party or another party, or he may start his own.
A rising star among progressives, Mr. Lee calls himself the Bernie Sanders of South Korea. But he is more like President-elect Donald J. Trump in one respect: He uses Twitter, too. He has a huge audience there and has used his pointed comments to attack Ms. Park and her policies. He was one of the first major politicians to address the crowds of antigovernment demonstrators who have filled central Seoul on recent weekends. He says that Ms. Park “should be handcuffed” on criminal charges the moment she leaves office. Like the other progressives listed here, his positions on the approach to North Korea and missile defense are similar to Mr. Moon’s. Mr. Lee worked in a factory as a teenager and did not attend high school, but he taught himself, winning admission to a college and later passing the bar exam. Before running for mayor, he worked as a lawyer defending labor activists and political dissidents.
A millionaire software mogul who leads a small opposition party, Mr. Ahn became a political star for his plain talk about equality and justice and his searing criticism of the existing political parties and big business. “Bill Gates wouldn’t have become Bill Gates if he were born in South Korea,” Mr. Ahn once said, accusing Samsung, Hyundai and other major corporations of creating “zoos” where they have shackled small entrepreneurs with slavelike contracts. Once considered a top contender for the 2012 election, he withdrew his candidacy, throwing his support behind Mr. Moon, with whom he has since parted ways. A medical doctor by training, Mr. Ahn made a fortune developing antivirus computer software. He says he wants to heal a country disillusioned with what he calls a corrupt and out-of-touch political and corporate elite.
