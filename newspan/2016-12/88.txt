Russia’s state-owned energy giant, Gazprom, said Tuesday that it had filed proposals with the European Commission aimed at resolving charges of antitrust activity.
Gazprom, which supplies a third of the European Union’s gas, has been on the European Commission’s radar since 2012, culminating in charges last year that it had overcharged customers in Eastern and Central Europe and blocked rivals.
Since then, Gazprom has offered concessions aimed at staving off a potential fine of up to 10 percent of its global sales.
Gazprom’s deputy chairman, Alexander Medvedev, said in an email that the company was ready to take into account Europe’s criticism “where it is substantiated and possible.” The energy giant added it hoped for a resolution in the near future.
Gazprom did not elaborate on the details of its proposals.
