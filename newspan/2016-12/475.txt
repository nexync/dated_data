Technology companies plunged on Wall Street on Thursday, and high-dividend stocks took hefty losses as bond yields rose to their highest level in more than a year.
But more big gains for blue-chip banking and oil stocks pulled the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high.
The Dow gained 68.35 points, or 0.4 percent, to 19,191.93. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 7.73 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,191.08. The Nasdaq composite fell 72.57 points, or 1.4 percent, to 5,251.11.
Big names like Facebook and Oracle fell as technology companies took their biggest losses in two months. Rising bond yields pushed income-seeking investors away from real estate and utility companies. Health care stocks also slumped.
Banks continued to soar; investors expect them to make bigger profits on loans as interest rates rise. Oil prices climbed for a second day after OPEC’s member nations agreed to trim oil production next year.
Stock indexes set records after the presidential election last month, but lately they have wobbled as different industries have been pulled in opposite directions.
Bond prices continued to tumble, sending benchmark yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.45 percent from 2.39 percent, its highest since July 2015. That sent bank stocks higher because higher bond yields are linked to higher interest rates, which allow banks to make more money from lending.
Goldman Sachs jumped $7.34, or 3.4 percent, to $226.63, and JPMorgan Chase picked up $1.62, or 2 percent, to $81.79. Goldman is trading at its highest price since December 2007.
Facebook skidded $3.32, or 2.8 percent, to $115.10. The chip maker Analog Devices dropped $5.23, or 7 percent, to $69.01. Microsoft lost $1.06, or 1.8 percent, to $59.20.
After a big gain on Wednesday, the dollar slipped to 114.00 yen from 114.41 yen. The euro rose to $1.0660 from $1.0596. In the last few weeks the dollar has reached a 13-year high compared with other currencies. A strong dollar hurts profits and sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas, and the S.&P. 500’s technology companies get nearly 60 percent of their revenue outside the United States.
Oil prices rallied again and reached their highest level since mid-October. Benchmark crude picked up $1.62, or 3.3 percent, to close at $51.06 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for pricing international oils, added $2.10, or 4.1 percent, to $53.94 a barrel in London. Chevron gained $1.73, or 1.6 percent, to $113.29, and Phillips 66 rose $1.90, or 2.3 percent, to $84.98.
The price of oil soared 9 percent Wednesday after the members of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, agreed to a small cut in production starting in January. The price of oil has traded mostly from $40 to $50 a barrel since early April. It dipped as low as $26 a barrel in February.
Auto sales climbed in November and broke out of a recent slump, prompting automaker shares to rise. Ford gained 47 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $12.43; General Motors rose $1.90, or 5.5 percent, to $36.43.
Gold fell $3.90, to $1,166.90 an ounce. Silver rose 2 cents, to $16.51 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent, to $2.64 a pound.
European stock indexes fell. The DAX in Germany lost 1 percent, and in Britain the FTSE 100 fell 0.5 percent. The CAC 40 in France shed 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.1 percent and the Kospi of South Korea was little changed. The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong gained 0.4 percent.
