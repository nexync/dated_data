DAKAR, Senegal — The fate of the presidency in Gambia took a peculiar turn Friday night when the longtime incumbent appeared on state television to announce that he was rejecting the results of last week’s vote that ousted him. He also called for new elections.
Seated in front of microphones and between two flags, President Yahya Jammeh rattled off accusations of voter irregularities, from transposed numbers in tabulations to missing numbers that he said left in question the results of the election that handed the presidency to Adama Barrow.
Last week, thousands of Gambians took to the streets in celebration after Mr. Jammeh, known for a repressive and eccentric regime criticized by human rights groups and many Western governments, appeared on state television to concede defeat and heartily congratulate Mr. Barrow after the Dec. 1 vote.
In addition to outlandish claims that he could cure AIDS with prayer, a concoction of herbs and a banana, Mr. Jammeh was notorious for jailing opponents — at least two of whom died in prison this year — as well as carrying out so-called witch hunts and saying that gay people should be beheaded.
Many in Gambia, the smallest country on the African continent, were stunned that a man who once predicted he would rule a billion years if it was the will of God would give up power so easily. Now, it appears he may not relinquish power after all.
It was not immediately clear how Mr. Barrow, a real estate agent thrust into the candidacy with no political experience, would respond. He called an emergency meeting with other party officials late Friday night.
