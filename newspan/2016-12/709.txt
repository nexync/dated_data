While some were surprised to see a magazine for teenagers making such a strong political statement, Teen Vogue has been speaking frankly about more than fashion for a while.
The magazine, whose top editor, Elaine Welteroth, and digital editorial director, Phillip Picardi, took over earlier this year, has been ramping up its political coverage since the primary debates. Aimed at teens and young women, the website and quarterly print magazine combine beauty tips and features on teen celebrities with stories about young activists, gender roles and LGBT rights. An explanation of the dangers of the Dakota Access Pipeline by two young women from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe was among the magazine’s most-watched videos ever.
Teen Vogue says it plans to stay the course and cover Mr. Trump’s policies aggressively, particularly as they affect young people. Part of the strategy, Ms. Welteroth and Mr. Picardi say, is to let teenage girls tell their own stories of how political issues affect their lives, whether it’s a Dakota Access pipeline video or a first-person account of getting an abortion in Ohio.
As Teen Vogue’s writers and editors cover the Trump presidency, they may get help — and constructive criticism — from their readers. Ms. Gevinson said teenagers are used to seeing a wide variety of perspectives online, and they know that for every argument, “there will always be a counterargument.” And young readers today, Ms. Halpin said, are comfortable calling out errors or missteps on social media. In other words, it may not be easy to gaslight teenagers.
