Musicians including Black Thought, Regina Spektor, Ashanti and Ja Rule performed songs from “The Hamilton Mixtape” on Thursday at the Richard Rodgers Theater, a day before the release of the album.
The album contains reworked versions of songs from the musical “Hamilton,” recorded by a star-studded group that also includes Kelly Clarkson, Usher, Alicia Keys and Chance the Rapper.
The mini-concert on Thursday was streamed live from the theater. Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of “Hamilton,” was in London filming a live-action sequel to “Mary Poppins,” but appeared via a recorded video.
Ms. Spektor sang “Dear Theodosia,” Aaron Burr’s ode to his newborn daughter, and Andra Day performed a fiery version of “Burn” to a standing ovation.
The program wound up with a duet of “Helpless” by Ashanti and Ja Rule. Ja Rule performed Mr. Miranda’s original verse, but changed a reference about Harlem to Queens, where he grew up.
