Three days into a recount of Michigan’s presidential votes, a federal judge issued a ruling late Wednesday that cleared the way to end it.
The judge, Mark A. Goldsmith, who had ordered the new count to begin on Monday as part of a temporary restraining order focused on timing, removed his order late Wednesday. But the legal maneuvering appeared far from over. Representatives for Jill Stein, the Green Party’s presidential nominee, who has called for recounts in three states, said they intended to pursue other legal avenues in Michigan.
Seeking new vote counts in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Ms. Stein, who finished a distant fourth in the presidential race, has cited concerns about computer hacking and the reliability of voting machines. Her effort has set off legal fights with lawyers for President-elect Donald J. Trump, his campaign and his allies, who view the recounts as a needless and expensive tactic.
Even as county officials in Michigan rushed this week to recount votes in borrowed offices and conference centers, the legal battle proceeded in multiple courtrooms simultaneously. A state Court of Appeals decision on Tuesday concurred with complaints from Michigan Republicans that Ms. Stein did not meet the state’s legal requirements for a recount as an “aggrieved” party because she had not come close to winning.
On Wednesday night, Judge Goldsmith, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, did not disagree.
“Because there is no basis for this court to ignore the Michigan court’s ruling and make an independent judgment regarding what the Michigan Legislature intended by the term ‘aggrieved,’ plaintiffs have not shown an entitlement to a recount under Michigan’s statutory scheme,” he wrote.
Ms. Stein’s lawyers said they were disappointed with Judge Goldsmith’s ruling but had no intention of giving up.
