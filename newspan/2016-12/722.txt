As NBC was building suspense for the magazine’s carefully staged announcement on the “Today” show, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter at 7:18 a.m. that he would appear shortly on the program.
The magazine’s “No. 2” person of the year was Mrs. Clinton, who is on track to win the popular vote but lost the Electoral College in the presidential election to Mr. Trump.
Time magazine has named President-elect Donald J. Trump its person of the year for 2016. Mr. Trump spoke to the magazine about his election and his supporters.
The magazine’s annual selection is more of an exercise in self-promotion than covering the news, but Mr. Trump actually gave “Today” some news during the announcement.
In a wide-ranging interview, the president-elect told Mr. Lauer that he expected to announce his choice for secretary of state next week. He also addressed his apparent decision in June — announced on Tuesday — to sell all of his stock holdings.
Nancy Gibbs, Time’s editor, said Mr. Trump’s selection this year was “one of the more straightforward” choices the magazine had made.
Mr. Trump has been on the magazine’s cover many times in 2016 for features that were both positive and negative. In January, he called its profile of him “one of the best I’ve ever had.” In August, Time featured an illustrated likeness of him melting down, as rumors swirled that his campaign was faltering; two months later, it revisited that image to show him in full meltdown.
Last year, Mr. Trump complained when Time chose Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and not him as its person of the year. “They picked the person who is ruining Germany,” he said then.
In 2013, he called its list of influential people “a joke” and said the magazine would soon fail.
Time has occasionally chosen controversial figures, among them Adolf Hitler (in 1938) and Josef Stalin (twice: in 1939 and 1942).
In 1969, it chose “The Middle Americans” for the honor, celebrating them for continuing to pray in public schools in defiance of the United States Supreme Court and electing Richard M. Nixon (who himself would become the person of the year in 1971) to the White House.
Nearly 40 years later, the magazine plastered a mirror on the cover of the magazine and named “You” its person of the year for 2006. In 1982, there was a “machine of the year”: the computer.
