New York Today: Who Is Your New Yorker of the Year?
Good morning on this drizzly Monday.
As we near the end of an eventful year — perhaps “eventful” is an understatement — we’re reflecting on the moments and the people who most defined 2016.
And so, we kick off the second annual New York Today New Yorker of the Year contest, to honor those who have shaped our city over the past 12 months in some way, big or small.
To begin the brainstorming, we spoke to last year’s winner, the Rev. Ann Kansfield, the Fire Department’s first female (and first lesbian) chaplain.
What makes a model New Yorker?
“Someone who loves the city and all of the people in it,” Chaplain Kansfield told us.
What qualities come to mind?
Who would you nominate for this year’s contest?
Sgt. Hameed Armani and the city’s nearly 1,000 Muslim police officers, she said.
Sergeant Armani, an immigrant from Afghanistan, was one of the officers who bravely drove what looked to be a bomb away from Times Square in July.
“That stuck out to me as a group, and an individual representative of that group, that really is willing to make self-sacrifices for the people of the city,” she said.
She also nominated the former firefighter Ray Pfeifer, who is battling cancer that was linked to his work as an emergency worker on Sept. 11, 2001.
Mr. Pfeifer, along with the advocate John Feal and the comedian Jon Stewart, worked to get health coverage “for thousands of New Yorkers who are sick as a result of their service at ground zero,” she said.
• The late Rose Orbach, a 104-year-old Queens resident who voted in her 16th consecutive presidential election in November, reminding us of our civic duties and our rights, which so many around the world do not have.
• The photographer Bill Cunningham, who captured New York in an inimitable way and remains a reminder to always do what you love.
• Jackie-Michelle Martinez, the longtime Fire Department veteran who is spearheading the institution’s efforts to recruit more women.
• Ken Thompson, the first black district attorney of Brooklyn and a voice for racial justice, who died from cancer in October.
• Anthony Butler, a blind Bronx native who ran his first New York City Marathon, showing us that anything is possible.
• The cast of “Hamilton,” who used the stage not only to teach us about our roots but also to remind the government about its responsibility to uphold our American values.
• The community around West 23rd Street in Chelsea, which came together to help the residents of Selis Manor, a home for the blind, after a bomb exploded next to it in September.
• Or perhaps the three past presidential candidates with ties to New York: Donald J. Trump, Bernie Sanders, or Hillary Clinton.
Those were a few exemplary New Yorkers. But we want to know others. Who do you think should be named the New Yorker(s) of the Year, and why? Please nominate someone by filling out the form at the bottom of today’s column by Friday, Dec. 9.
It’s the morning commute that looks soggy, but the afternoon looks clear and dry, with a high of 50.
Scattered showers are expected throughout the week.
Prepare your umbrella for a workout.
• Scoreboard: Steelers topple Giants, 24-14. Red Wings defeat Islanders, 4-3. Knicks oust Kings, 106-96.

Now that we’ve gotten the ball rolling, we’d love for you to tell us who, in your eyes, are the New Yorkers of the Year.
It might be someone who made a difference in the community, or someone who put others first in challenging situations. Or perhaps someone who embodied New York values for the betterment of society.
This person doesn’t have to be famous, but we do ask that you try to look beyond your household and family.
You can share your ideas by filling out this form.
• The name of the person you are nominating.
• Their neighborhood.
• A brief description of why they should be named New York Today’s New Yorker of the Year.
Be creative and encourage your friends, family and neighbors to participate in nominating someone. We’ll announce the finalists and New York Today’s New Yorker of the Year this month.
Note: We are no longer accepting nominations for New York of the Year. The deadline was Dec. 9.
