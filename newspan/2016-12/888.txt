For more than 30 years, God’s Love We Deliver has been cooking and delivering nourishing meals to those with debilitating illnesses. The nonprofit organization was founded during the AIDS crisis, and has gradually expanded its reach. Jon Gilman, a member of the organization’s board, and the food writer Christopher Idone, who died of cancer last spring, compiled this benefit cookbook, with recipes and personal anecdotes about food and cooking from celebrities like Mikhail Baryshnikov, Mario Batali, April Bloomfield, Roz Chast, Alan Cumming, Suvir Saran, Meryl Streep and Alice Waters. Add the fennel braised in root beer and the roasted pears with custard to your recipe file. The sale of each book provides five meals: “God’s Love We Deliver Cookbook,” compiled by Jon Gilman and Christopher Idone (God’s Love We Deliver, $50), godslovecookbook.com.
