Throughout the year, as the fashion tribe migrates from New York to London to Milan and Paris, and then repeats that same process six months later, many of the most eye-catching looks are found not only on the runways, but also on the streets outside. Some are worn by familiar faces, like Anna Dello Russo and Giovanna Engelbert, but others are donned by relative unknowns, all hoping to grab the attention of the ever-present photographers and perhaps become a street style star.
