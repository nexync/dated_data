Re “A Foolish Power Grab in Congo,’’ (editorial, Nov. 21): The continued violent protest due to the intended postponement of presidential elections has led to the death of dozens of Congolese. If President Joseph Kabila were to extend his term, there would be further violence which could lead to the death of millions of people, such as in the Congolese conflict of 1998 to 2003. I have seen firsthand the suffering and deprivation of human rights in the resulting influx of refugees to neighboring countries. When I conducted my Ph.D. research in Tanzania’s Nyarugusu Camp, refugees from Congo and the Great Lakes region told me their stories of torture, trauma, rape, hunger, insecurity — and the neglect of the international community.
