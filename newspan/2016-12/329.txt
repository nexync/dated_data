Lydia Polgreen, who until last week was the editorial director for The New York Times Global, has been named as the editor in chief of the Huffington Post.
Celebrated as one of The Times’s stars, Ms. Polgreen previously worked as a foreign correspondent in South Africa, India and West Africa for The Times, and has also served as a deputy international editor. She has written about everything from “Girls” to Nelson Mandela (and his funeral) to unrest in Ferguson, Mo.
In this podcast, Ms. Polgreen talks about her 15 years at The Times, journalism in the age of Trump, and what she calls the prospect of building “a news organization, in the tradition of the great working-class tabloids, that speaks for and to people who feel left out” of prevailing political, social and economic arrangements.
Ms. Polgreen shares some of the surprising sources of inspiration — Roger Ailes and a WBEZ podcast about the making of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” — that she’s found while contemplating the new job.
A self-described “ink-stained journalist,” Ms. Polgreen says she does not expect to be “quite as jet set” as her predecessor, Arianna Huffington, the departing Huffington Post co-founder and former editor in chief whom Ms. Polgreen says she has met and greatly admires.
