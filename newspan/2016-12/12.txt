It’s no secret that “La La Land,” the new movie from director Damien Chazelle (“Whiplash”) is a tribute to the flashy musicals of yesteryear. But the film is set in the present, following Mia, a would-be actress (Emma Stone) and Seb, an ambitious jazz musician (Ryan Gosling), both of whom are struggling to achieve their dreams in Los Angeles.
Some reviews have compared the chemistry between Gosling and Stone to that between Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, even if the dance skills of the former don’t quite match up. Although the dance styles featured in “La La Land” (jazz, contemporary, tap and a few steps from ballroom among them) are as varied as its influences, several moments in the film evoke American cinema’s most famous dancing couple. That is especially obvious during the movie’s airy waltz sequences, one of which takes place among the stars at the Griffith Observatory.
There are many references in “La La Land” to some of Kelly’s best-known movies, like “Singin’ in the Rain” and especially “An American in Paris,” a musical about an American G.I. turned painter (Kelly) who falls for a local girl (Leslie Caron).
“La La Land” emphasizes a lot of bold colors in otherwise everyday settings, which brings to mind the poppy musicals of the French director Jacques Demy. The dance numbers in Demy’s movies didn’t break away from their plots in dream sequences. Demy preferred mundane settings: a coffee shop, a sidewalk, or in this moment from his 1967 film, “The Young Girls of Rochefort,” amid a group of parked trucks aboard a ferry.
