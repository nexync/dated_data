The complex life of the world’s most ubiquitous footwear may flash before the eyes in “Out of the Box: The Rise of Sneaker Culture” at the Oakland Museum of California. Organized by the estimable Bata Shoe Museum of Toronto with the American Federation of Arts in New York, the exhibition promises nearly 150 examples of this indispensable item. Some date to the first half of the 19th century and the onset of pre-vulcanized rubber overshoes. From there, the show traces the sneaker’s ascent; its role in sports, hip-hop and men’s style; and its evolving technology and breakthroughs.
