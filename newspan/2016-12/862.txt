Troy Ave, the Brooklyn rapper charged with attempted murder after a May shooting at a concert at a Manhattan club, was shot twice on Sunday, the police said.
The rapper, whose real name is Roland Collins, was driving a red Maserati around 4:20 p.m. in Brooklyn when an unidentified man approached the vehicle, which was stopped at an intersection at East 91st Street and Linden Boulevard. The gunman fired multiple rounds, the police said. Mr. Collins was struck twice, taking a gunshot wound to the arm and a graze wound to his head. He then crashed his vehicle into a parked car.
Mr. Collins went to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, where he was hospitalized in fair condition. The police are investigating the shooting, though they said they had no description of the gunman. No arrests had been made as of Sunday night.
In June, Mr. Collins pleaded not guilty to attempted second-degree murder and other counts in connection with the shooting at the Irving Plaza concert hall in Manhattan. In August, he sued the club and the concert promoter Live Nation, which oversees the club, accusing it of lax security.
The shooting occurred at a May 25 show that was to feature the rapper T.I. Before he was able to perform, however, shots were fired in a green room, killing Mr. Collinsâ€™s bodyguard Ronald McPhatter, 33, and wounding Mr. Collins and two other people.
Security footage showed Mr. Collins firing one shot amid the scuffle. He had been scheduled to appear as a guest of T.I. that night and had entered through a V.I.P. entrance, according to the lawsuit.
