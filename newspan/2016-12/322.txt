What Are Critics Saying About Netflix’s Mysterious New Show, ‘The OA’?
Netflix announced in early 2015 that it was developing a series called “The OA,” from creators Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij, the team behind the indie films “Sound of My Voice” and “The East.” But it wasn’t until Dec. 16, 2016, that the streaming service uploaded a trailer for the show and revealed that its eight-episode first season would debut four days later.
Now that it has made its premiere, we know that the “The OA” is a sci-fi drama with spiritual overtones. It follows Marling’s Prairie Johnson, a young woman who suddenly returns to her suburban Michigan hometown after having disappeared seven years earlier. Previously blind, she can now see perfectly, and she won’t discuss where she’s been.
The show, which is already earning “Stranger Things” comparisons, certainly sounds like a binge-watcher’s dream. But is it really worth abandoning your weekend plans for? Here’s what critics are saying.
Charles Bramesco mined Reddit to find the good, the bad and the bizarre conspiracy theories surrounding the show. “Love it or hate it, there’s no denying that ‘The OA’ has kept its audience guessing,” he writes in Vulture.
The show’s ending has proved to be one of the most controversial aspects of “The OA.” At Wired, Brian Raftery and Peter Rubin offer a detailed discussion of the finale, which includes a mild defense of the show’s “interpretive dance” and a warning against the dangers of trusting narrators.
