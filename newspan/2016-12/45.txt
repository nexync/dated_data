• In Syria, lines of buses and ambulances began ferrying people out of the ravaged city of Aleppo after a twice-stalled evacuation.
The fall of the city could become one of President Bashar al-Assad’s greatest victories. Rebels now control just one provincial capital, Idlib.
“I don’t know what will happen in Idlib, but if there is no cease-fire or political accord then it will become the next Aleppo,” said Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy for Syria.
• Russian hackers, including those behind the recent attacks intended to disrupt the U.S. presidential election, are hard to find, and thanks to Moscow’s protections, even harder to prosecute.
The Obama administration said it delayed blaming Russia for a cyberattack on the Democratic National Committee until Oct. 7 over concerns that any statement by the president would be viewed as politicizing intelligence.
President-elect Donald J. Trump cast doubt on the government’s conclusion that Russia carried out the cyberattack to further his campaign with the Kremlin’s approval, falsely claiming that the Obama administration did not raise the issue until after the Nov. 8 election.
• At a summit in Brussels, European leaders agreed to extend economic sanctions against Russia until mid-2017. They also attempted to rescue a free-trade deal with Ukraine by addressing Dutch concerns over immigration and security guarantees.

Where are the female composers of the last century?
That’s what a reader asked after seeing a big gap on the list we put together to accompany a story on the first opera by a woman produced at the Metropolitan Opera in over 100 years (the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho’s “L’Amour de Loin”).
“I would like to see you fill in that century with the modernist female composers we know are there!” the reader urged.
Nadia Boulanger (1887-1979), a famous teacher who was called “a one-woman graduate school,” composed exquisite songs.
One of her contemporaries, Ruth Crawford Seeger (1901-53), produced an excitingly wild, searching String Quartet. She also raised a family of folk singers that included her stepson, Pete Seeger.
And Yoko Ono, born in 1933, is best known for, well, other things, but she was also a conceptual composer out of the Fluxus school.
Here’s a playlist of works by women currently composing. Enjoy.
