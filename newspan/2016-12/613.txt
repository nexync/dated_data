George Michael, the pop superstar and icon of the 1980s and ’90s, died on Sunday, provoking an outpouring of fond and grief-stricken reaction from fans around the world, many of them celebrities in their own right.
Rest with the glittering stars, George Michael. You've found your Freedom, your Faith. It was your Last Christmas, and we shall miss you.
The rapper Q-Tip, the singer LeAnn Rimes Cibrian and the actor William Shatner all echoed a frustration shared by many on social media in response to a raft of recent celebrity deaths: The year had claimed yet another respected soul, they lamented.
The actor Rob Lowe and the singer- songwriter Josh Groban, as did many others, praised Mr. Michael’s striking singing voice.
While others, like Questlove, the drummer for the hip-hop group the Roots; the rock band OneRepublic; and comedian Ellen DeGeneres, remembered him simply as a legendary musician.
Some found themselves short on words to describe what they felt.
