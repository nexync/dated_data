LONDON — Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox said on Thursday that it had reached a deal to take full control of the British satellite television giant Sky, paying about $14.8 billion for the rest of the shares it does not already own.
The formal offer came as Labour politicians here called for Prime Minister Theresa May’s government to review the potential transaction over concerns it would concentrate too much media power in Mr. Murdoch’s hands.
Just over five years ago, 21st Century Fox’s predecessor company, News Corporation, withdrew a $12 billion offer for the rest of Sky — then known as BSkyB — as a firestorm erupted over phone hacking by the news media in Britain.
News Corporation, now a sister company of 21st Century Fox after the two split into separate companies, owns The Sun and The Times of London, as well as The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Murdoch is executive chairman of both companies.
After the companies provide formal notice to competition authorities, Karen Bradley, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, will have 10 days to decide whether there are public interest concerns about the deal. If she determines there are public interest issues, the transaction is likely to be referred for review to Ofcom, Britain’s broadcast and communications regulator.
“The secretary of state must refer the bid to Ofcom, to assess whether it would result in too much media power being concentrated in too few hands, and whether Rupert and James Murdoch are ‘fit and proper persons’ to run a broadcaster,” Tom Watson, Labour’s shadow secretary for culture, media and sport, said on Thursday, referring to Mr. Murdoch’s son.
The transaction also is expected to face a review by European Union antitrust regulators. Sky offers television, broadband and telephone phone services to nearly 22 million customers in Austria, Britain, Germany, Ireland and Italy.
Analysts said on Thursday that they did not expect the same sort of regulatory hurdles the deal faced when it was scrapped in 2011.
Ms. May replaced David Cameron as prime minister this summer after he resigned following Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. They are both members of the Conservative Party here.
“We’ll be engaging with the relevant agencies and authorities on that right away and hopefully get those timelines moving pretty fast,” James Murdoch, the chief executive of 21st Century Fox, said on a conference call with analysts.
Last week, 21st Century Fox announced that it had reached a preliminary agreement to acquire the 61 percent stake in Sky it did not already own. The transaction would value Sky over all at about $23 billion.
Under the terms of the transaction, 21st Century Fox will pay 10.75 pounds, or about $13.61, a share for the remainder of Sky. The offer represents a 40 percent premium to Sky’s closing price on Dec. 6, the last day before the initial Fox approach.
That would value the shares that 21st Century Fox does not own at about £11.7 billion.
Shares of Sky closed up slightly at £9.88 in London on Thursday, but continued to trade below the offer price.
21st Century Fox said it expected the transaction to close by the end of next year. If it does not close by the end of 2017, Sky shareholders would be eligible to receive a special dividend of 10 pence a share. The deal is arranged so that it requires approval from only 75 percent of Sky shareholders who vote on the transaction.
An independent committee of Sky’s directors indicated that it would recommend that shareholders accept the Fox offer.
“While the independent committee remains confident in Sky’s long-term prospects, as laid out in detail at our recent investor day in October, we, supported by our advisers, believe 21st Century Fox’s offer at a 40 percent premium to the undisturbed share price will accelerate and de-risk the delivery of future value for all Sky shareholders,” Martin Gilbert, Sky’s deputy chairman, said in a news release.
The latest takeover effort has been met less enthusiastically by some shareholders and politicians in Britain in recent days.
Over the weekend, a number of shareholders raised concerns about the price, with both Standard Life Investments and Jupiter Asset Management saying that the proposed bid undervalues the company.
“We would urge the independent committee of Sky directors, who recommended that shareholders accept the offer, to share more information on the independent financial advice that they based their agreement on,” Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, said.
Royal London owns less than 1 percent of Sky shares.
Before the offer, Sky’s share price was trading about 30 percent lower than it had as recently as the beginning of February. Some shareholders have accused Mr. Murdoch of trying to buy the company at a cut-rate price.
