Q. Is there a way to email a YouTube clip with a bookmark that makes it start at a certain time point in the video so my recipient doesn’t have to watch all the boring stuff at the beginning?
A. The desktop version of YouTube offers several ways to create links to specific parts of videos. You can also manually create links that start the clip in a chosen spot or have a website create the links for you.
If you are watching the clip in your computer’s browser and get to the part that you actually want your recipient to see, click the Pause button in the video player window. Right-click (or hold down the Control key while clicking) on the video window and choose “Copy video URL at current time.” You can then paste this link into an email message.
Another way to link to a specific time in the video is to modify the clip’s URL with additional information and then share the new version as a link. For example, if you want the video to start playing at two minutes and 10 seconds into the overall recording, go to the end of the video’s web address at the top of the browser window and type in #t=2m10s. The “#t=” part signifies a time jump and the “2m10s” shows where to land — two minutes and 10 seconds from the beginning.
If you do not want to fiddle with the URL yourself, make note of the time you want the clip to start playing in the time counter at the bottom of the video window. Next, go to a site like YouTube Time. Paste in the video’s mail URL and type in the start time you want to use. Click the Get Link button to get a new URL you can copy and share.
