Going to jail might seem like an intensely personal experience, the sort of thing that one must pass through alone. But those close to the inmate are also affected: To paraphrase an old saying, when someone serves time, the family serves it with them.
Salvador Espinoza’s recent photography project, “Q100: Photographing the City Bus to Rikers,” captures the collective aspect of incarceration. For several months over the past year, Mr. Espinoza rode the bus regularly from Queens Plaza to Rikers Island, the largest jail complex in New York City. He captured images of mothers tending to their children, girlfriends en route to see their boyfriends and the plastic trash cluttering the seats from the snacks they left behind.
Mr. Espinoza, 36, has spent his life in Long Island City, Queens. In late 2015, he was working on a project documenting the changes in the neighborhood when he began to notice a long line of families waiting for the bus each morning. He was curious where all of them were going, and one day he hopped on.
For a couple of months, he said, he simply rode, listening and observing, but eventually he brought along a camera. The resulting photographs are on display at QNS Collective in Long Island City until Jan. 15.
