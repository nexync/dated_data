SYDNEY, Australia — The commander of United States military operations in the Asia-Pacific region said on Wednesday that America’s commitment to the region would continue after Donald J. Trump became president, as would its opposition to Chinese expansion in the South China Sea.
During his Australia visit, Admiral Harris signed an agreement increasing the scope of the two countries’ military cooperation. Besides increasing the number of joint exercises carried out with about 1,250 United States Marines based in the northern city of Darwin, it allows for American F-22 jets to be deployed in the area for those exercises in 2017, likely to be followed by F-35 jets the year after.
