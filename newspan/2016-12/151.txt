I am not a fan of curated boxes of goods, as inevitably there is stuff in them that I do not want. But here is an exception. Zoé Capdevila and Bertrand Corp, a French couple living in Oakland, Calif., are assembling assortments of shelf-stable French items grouped around breakfast, drinks and dessert. The Parisian aperitif box contains a jar of onion confit spread, duck rillettes, Dijon mustard, cornichons, duck and pork pâté, crackers flavored with cheese, and little toasts, all of which I’m happy to have on hand for that next impromptu cocktail hour. Monthly subscriptions are available: Bon Appétit Boxes, $30 to $130, bonappetitbox.com.
