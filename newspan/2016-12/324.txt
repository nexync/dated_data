Can My Co-op Fine Me for Not Carpeting My Apartment?
Q. My family and I live in a co-op in Riverdale, in the Bronx. Our apartment is not 80 percent carpeted, as the lease requires, and my downstairs neighbor has complained about the noise our children make, although he plays his television loudly late at night. Building management has threatened to fine my wife and me unless we carpet our apartment. But our governing documents do not give management the explicit authority to impose such fines. What would be the consequences if we didn’t comply? Regardless, can I complain to the board about the noise my neighbor makes?
A. “Why should the neighbor be quiet if you’re not quiet?” said Patricia Napier-Fitzpatrick, the president of the Etiquette School of New York.
Buy some area rugs, with thick padding underneath. The lease requires carpeting, but it’s also a nice thing to do for the person living below you. “A man’s home is his castle, but in New York one man’s castle is directly above another man’s castle,” said Alan Fierstein, the owner of Acoustilog, an acoustical consultant in Manhattan.
You have a right to peace and quiet, too. Call management about the television noise and ask that it mediate a discussion between you and your neighbor. “The co-op has a duty to be evenhanded,” Mr. Greenstein said.
