Mr. Flynn has said the United States must lead a global campaign against “radical Islam.” He has on occasion pushed conspiracy theories. For example, after the attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, he kept asking intelligence officers working under him at the Defense Intelligence Agency in the Pentagon to look for involvement by Iran in the assault. There was no evidence of any ties to Iran.
In his book, Mr. Flynn mentions China and North Korea a half-dozen times.
Mr. Flynn did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
China is a secular Communist nation that has expressed concern about the spread of Islamic extremist ideas within its borders. It has said religious extremists are responsible for violence in Muslim areas of the western region of Xinjiang, and it has asked the United States for cooperation in counterterrorism operations there. American officials say they are reluctant to enter into close cooperation on Xinjiang matters, as some ethnic Uighurs and human rights groups say Chinese officials are violating human rights in Xinjiang.
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Flynn’s son, Michael G. Flynn, from his transition team after the younger Mr. Flynn used Twitter to support a conspiracy theory involving a pizza parlor in Washington, which was the subject of fake news stories. This week, a man citing that theory was arrested after firing a rifle in the restaurant, the police said.
