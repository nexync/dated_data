A Connecticut man who fled from a Georgia prison nearly 50 years ago and then settled into an unassuming life in his home state died on Monday, after a monthslong campaign to remain free.
The man, Robert Stackowitz, a native of Bridgeport, was convicted in 1966 of forcible robbery in Georgia, where he had traveled with friends. He escaped two years later from a prison work camp in Carroll County and surreptitiously returned to Connecticut.
He carved out a quiet existence in Sherman, a small town on the stateâ€™s western border with New York, where he repaired boat engines and used the alias Bob Gordon. But this year, he applied for Social Security benefits under his real name, which caught the attention of the authorities in Georgia, who had stopped searching for him years ago.
Mr. Stackowitz had multiple health problems, including cancer, diabetes, emphysema and heart disease. His lawyers had argued that he would not survive the trip if forced to return to Georgia to serve out his sentence.
In September, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles decided to grant Mr. Stackowitz, who had served only two years of a 17-year sentence, a medical reprieve because of his deteriorating condition. Authorities there said the state would ask that Connecticut keep Mr. Stackowitz under community supervision.
Reactions were mixed in the semirural town after residents learned about their notorious neighbor. Some said he should pay for his long-ago crime, while others said he should be allowed to remain free. After his condition worsened last weekend, Mr. Stackowitz was taken to Danbury Hospital, where he died on Monday, according to his lawyers.
