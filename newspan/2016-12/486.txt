• China appeared to concede that it was, after all, placing antiaircraft guns and other defenses on disputed islands in the South China Sea, despite having pledged not to militarize there.
The news is sure to stoke an already testy relationship with President-elect Donald J. Trump. His challenge to China over Taiwan has inspired excitement there — as well as trepidation over possibly being used as pawns.
• In Syria, lines of buses and ambulances began ferrying people out of the ravaged city of Aleppo as a twice-stalled evacuation appeared to begin in earnest.
The fall of the city could become one of President Bashar al-Assad’s greatest victories. Rebels now control just one provincial capital, Idlib.
The decision reflects growing tension between the two traditional allies over the incendiary behavior of President Rodrigo Duterte, whose brutal antidrug campaign has left thousands dead.
• Top officials are poised to declare Beijing’s stifling air pollution a natural disaster.
Doing so will allow the city to draw on relief funds, but opponents say it will ease pressure on officials to solve the problem.
• The United States faces difficulties — sometimes impossibilities — in combating Russian hackers, including those behind the recent attacks intended to affect the U.S. presidential election.
They are hard to find, and thanks in part to Russian protections, even harder to prosecute.
• A 22-year-old white supremacist who admitted to one of the most unfathomable racial attacks in the U.S. in decades was found guilty on a multitude of charges of hate crimes.
Dylann Roof, who fatally shot nine black parishioners in South Carolina last year, awaits sentencing by the same jury in a few weeks, either to life in prison without parole or death.

Where are the female composers of the last century?
That’s what a reader asked after seeing a big gap on the list we put together to accompany a story on the first opera by a woman produced at the Metropolitan Opera in over 100 years (the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho’s “L’Amour de Loin”).
“I would like to see you fill in that century with the modernist female composers we know are there!” the reader urged.
Nadia Boulanger (1887-1979), a famous teacher called “a one-woman graduate school,” composed exquisite songs.
One of her contemporaries, Ruth Crawford Seeger (1901-53), produced an excitingly wild, searching String Quartet. She also raised a family of folk singers that included her stepson, Pete Seeger.
And Yoko Ono, born in 1933, is best known for, well, other things, but she was also a conceptual composer out of the Fluxus school.
Here’s a playlist of works by women currently composing. Enjoy.
