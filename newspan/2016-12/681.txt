LONDON — Within five minutes of the first episode of “Fleabag,” Phoebe Waller-Bridge is masturbating over President Obama. As he gives a speech on her laptop, her right hand drifts down under the duvet. “There will be difficult days along the way,” Mr. Obama warns. The screen starts to jiggle.
That sequence is “Fleabag” in a nutshell: irreverent, lewd and upfront to a fault. In this sitcom, which has been available on Amazon Prime since September, Ms Waller-Bridge plays a 20-something woman — never named, just Fleabag — with an insatiable sexual appetite. She picks up men on public transportation and reignites old flames, but beneath the bravado, she’s a grieving, angsty, insecure mess. Fleabag is so liberated, she has gotten herself lost.
She has never been drawn to stand-up (“so exposing, just you and a mike”), but “Fleabag” isn’t all that different. It had its premiere at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe three years ago, in a damp, disused bank vault, having begun as 10 minutes of material written on a whim for a comic storytelling night.
The flip side is that Fleabag’s shamelessness is perversely empowering. For Ms. Waller-Bridge, the writing should “always be about the glory of being a woman,” with Fleabag free to say anything.
“I looked exactly like Russell Brand,” she added.
It shows. Her earlier sitcom, “Crashing,” about a group of property guardians (they pay low rents to live in disused buildings) in a contemporary London squat, won her another TV commission: a comedy thriller, “Killing Eve,” about a psychopathic assassin and the spy on her tail.
And what of “Fleabag,” which ran for six episodes and could stand as is?
She paused, then said, “That’s the thing I’m trying to crack at the moment.” “Fleabag” will be back.
