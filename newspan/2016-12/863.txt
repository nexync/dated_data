Late on Christmas Eve, the hip-hop duo Run the Jewels, featuring Killer Mike and El-P, surprised fans by releasing their much-anticipated third album, “RTJ3,” three weeks early, and for free.
The collection, which was announced during the coda of an ad hoc “Portlandia” skit on the group’s YouTube page, features collaborations with the jazz composer and saxophonist Kamasi Washington; the rappers Danny Brown and Trina; the producer Boots; and Zack de la Rocha of Rage Against the Machine.
It comes two years after the album “RTJ2,” which was praised for its cleareyed take on racial hostility in America.
“RTJ3” is available as a download and on streaming services, and physical copies will be available on Jan. 13.
