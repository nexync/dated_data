DEMRE, Turkey — The jagged Taurus Mountains rise on one side of the church, while the Mediterranean Sea gleams in the distance on the other. The bougainvillea is in bloom, the orange trees bursting with ripe fruit. It is, in other words, a long way from here to the North Pole.
Still, Mr. Ozel said he believed the government could be doing more to promote the special history of St. Nicholas and his place in worldwide Christian traditions. In Turkey these days, the Islamist government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has worked hard to promote the country’s Ottoman history while, critics say, ignoring Turkey’s important place in Christian history.
Last year, Mr. Ozel and his friends tried to put on a play about St. Nicholas’s life at a local amphitheater but could not find any financial support, not from the municipality or elsewhere.
In addition to his anonymous gift-giving, St. Nicholas is remembered as a maker of miracles, and Russians and other Orthodox Christians come to Demre to pray for healing or to be saved from financial ruin. Many couples who are unable to conceive come and pray for children.
Yulia Abdallina, a Russian who came to Turkey a few years ago for an internship and ended up staying and working at the museum’s gift shop, said that every so often, “real Santa Clauses” visited, dressed in red outfits. The last one she met was from Germany. “He was really fat, and he had a white beard,” she said.
In the history of St. Nicholas and the story of Santa Claus, there is the common thread of selfless giving, the spirit of this season.
