LONDON — Lloyds Banking Group will buy Bank of America’s British credit card business for about $2.4 billion, signaling a major turning point for Lloyds eight years after a government bailout.
The deal for the business, called MBNA Limited, will bolster Lloyds’s consumer finance business in Britain by adding about 7 billion pounds, or $8.7 billion, in assets. Lloyds also said its market share in the British credit card market would rise to more than a quarter from 15 percent, a level that would bring it closer to Barclays, the largest provider of credit cards in Britain with a share of nearly 30 percent.
The deal culminates years of upheaval and reorganization at the bank, which the British government bailed out in the middle of the 2008 global financial crisis. The British government at one point owned more than 40 percent of Lloyds.
The purchase of MBNA is the latest in a series of milestones achieved since António Horta-Osório, the chief executive of Lloyds, joined the lender in 2011 after leading Banco Santander’s business in Britain.
Lloyds returned to a profit in 2014 and paid its first dividend since its bailout last year. The government now owns less than 7 percent of Lloyds after announcing plans in October to resume sales of its shares.
The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2017 and is subject to regulatory approval.
Lloyds said the deal is expected to increase its revenue by £650 million a year. In the first half of 2016, the assets being sold generated post-tax profits of £123 million, Lloyds said.
UBS advised Lloyds on the MBNA transaction.
