Well, that’s the way it used to be back in the 1970s, but much less so today. Back then, only 3 percent of former members of Congress stayed in Washington as lobbyists; today almost half do.
Being a good citizen can provide psychic income, and that used to be, it seems, what drew more idealistic women and men to serve in Congress. Today, many more former members are willing to trade in — and on — their public service stints for lucrative corporate lobbying jobs.
Out in the country, “Washington lobbyist” is a symbol of a rigged political system to many on the right and the left. What makes the rigging especially dispiriting is that so many former members of Congress are part of it.
