Is Snapchat a Revolutionary Form of Social Media?
Do you use Snapchat?
From the time it came out in 2011, Snapchat has been dismissed by many as a passing fad. Recently, Snapchat and its parent company, Snap, Inc., have added more serious news stories to Snapchat’s roster of celebrity news, and featured stories from all over the world. The company has just released its Spectacles video eyeglasses and plans to go public with an initial public offering next year.
What do you think? Is Snapchat worthy of respect as a revolutionary form of social media?
— What is it about Snapchat that appeals to people younger than 25? What makes it different than other forms of social media, in your opinion? How would you improve it or change it, if you could?
— The Times technology writer Farhad Manjoo writes, “Snap can free itself from Silicon Valley’s accepted norms because it doesn’t think of itself as just another Silicon Valley tech company. It’s time we all started to see it that way, too.” Do you agree with Mr. Manjoo? Why or why not?
—In addition to a new way to report news all over the world, what are some of Snap’s other innovations that make it especially noteworthy and enjoyable or valuable to users? If you have the opposite opinion, that these innovations are not noteworthy to you, explain why.
