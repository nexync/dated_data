So it’s unlikely that Apple is misunderstanding the significance of the term when it says Nokia is employing the tactics of a patent troll in a long-running licensing fight now heading to courts all over the world, as Vindu Goel and Mark Scott write.
A patent troll is a term for a company whose business is solely based on licensing the use of patents to other companies. Sometimes these licensing deals are negotiated amicably, and sometimes they’re settled in a protracted legal battle.
Trolls have been around for some time, and a few years ago, many in Silicon Valley argued that trolls were a crippling drag on the industry, particularly on start-ups that don’t have the financial resources to fight. But there was thought by people in the tech industry that the most egregious examples of their patent exploitation had eased in recent years, which brings us back to Apple and Nokia.
There is little dispute that most of the Nokia patents are legitimate. Before the company came undone mostly because of competition from outfits like Apple, Nokia was a pioneer in mobile phones.
The issue, as is usually the case, is money. For the last five years, Apple has licensed a portfolio of Nokia products. But the two companies have not been able to negotiate a new deal.
Adding another wrinkle is Nokia’s intellectual property partners. Nokia has divided its portfolio and transferred parts of it to Acacia Research and Conversant Intellectual Property Management: Both companies find ways to make money from the patents, and then share the proceeds with Nokia.
Apple says Acacia and Conversant have filed 52 cases against it around the world, many of which assert violations of Nokia patents. Apple also says that’s an attempt to unfairly increase costs; it has filed an antitrust suit to stop Nokia. But it seems unlikely the fight will be over anytime soon.
