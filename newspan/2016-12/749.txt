There is a complex tension for many New Yorkers between sharing information with the police for their own safety, and the fear of being targeted by the same police force once they share that information.
As an attorney for Bronx Defenders, I was struck by the article. My office is only two blocks from the Melrose and Jackson Houses, near where Mr. Maldonado was killed, and I often walk past them on my way to and from the office. I have had several clients who called 911 to report a crime or ask for help only to be arrested when the police arrived.
As a former organizer, I have led door-knocking drives in those same buildings to recruit residents to join police-reform campaigns, and heard story after story of aggressive officers patrolling hallways on “vertical sweeps” and harassing residents and their neighbors, demanding identification and a stated purpose for being there.
If you were questioned by officers every time you walked into your own home, got arrested after calling 911 in a crisis, and watched your children grow up being stopped and frisked with the fear that they might be harmed or killed by the very people sworn to protect them, would you want to talk to the police?
