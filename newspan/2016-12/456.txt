Rupert Murdoch’s already vast empire now encompasses even more of the British media.
On Thursday, 21st Century Fox reached a deal to take full control of the satellite television company Sky, paying $14.8 billion for the shares it did not own.
The company had tried to buy Sky in 2010, but withdrew its offer when a phone hacking scandal erupted in the British news media. At the time, 21st Century Fox and News Corporation — which owns The Sun and The Times of London — had not yet been separated.
The latest deal has already attracted scrutiny.
Politicians have called for the British government to review the transaction because of concerns over concentration of media power. It is already expected to come under review by European Union antitrust regulators.
For sale: data from more than one billion Yahoo users, including several million military and civilian government employees from dozens of nations.
The cost: about $300,000 for each copy of the database, according to Andrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer at InfoArmor, an online security firm.
Mr. Komarov monitors the dark corners of the internet inhabited by criminals, spies and spammers, and said three buyers paid for a complete copy of the information.
Yahoo’s stock plunged 6 percent on Thursday as investors worried that the disclosure of the huge security breach would put at risk the deal for it to be sold to Verizon.
Mr. Komarov said his company alerted military and law enforcement authorities in several countries about the hack, but did not go to Yahoo directly because it had been dismissive of InfoArmor when it was approached by an intermediary.

Trump, not to go too far in restricting immigration. The auction has raised questions because of the prominent role that the president-elect’s children have in the transition process.
After a bleak January for stocks, major American markets have been at or near record highs as we near the end of the year.
More recently, the dollar has surged and Treasury prices have tumbled after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, as The Wall Street Journal reports. This could hamper earnings, but stock markets seem to have taken it in stride.
It can be tricky to predict what will happen on the stock market, especially if you’re not sure what lies ahead in a Trump administration.
