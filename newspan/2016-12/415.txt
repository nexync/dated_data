Madonna takes the world by storm in her “Rebel Heart” tour. “Mozart in the Jungle” travels to Italy as Season 3 begins.
MADONNA: REBEL HEART TOUR (2016) 9 p.m. on Showtime. An unapologetic, lingerie-clad Madonna works the runway and the stripper pole in this concert special, which ventures onstage and behind the scenes of her seven-month, 55-city “Rebel Heart” tour. The playlist runs from “Like a Virgin” and “True Blue” to “Iconic” and “Bitch I’m Madonna.” Katy Perry dances along.
MOZART IN THE JUNGLE on Amazon. Season 3 of this Golden Globe-winning series, spun from Blair Tindall’s memoir, finds the fictional New York Symphony shattered in the midst of a lockout — and Rodrigo, its enfant terrible music director (Gael García Bernal), on a tempestuous Italian adventure with the opera diva Alessandra (Monica Bellucci). The oboist Hailey (Lola Kirke, Ms. Tindall’s onscreen doppelgänger) is touring Europe and discovering her own passion for conducting. For the full Italian experience, pair it with “Medici: Masters of Florence” (Netflix), a historical drama about that Renaissance dynasty, starring Dustin Hoffman and Richard Madden.
