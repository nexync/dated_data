A soft snow was falling outside the Apollo Theater as the crowds arrived late Sunday afternoon, and the lobby inside was decked out for the holidays. When the lights dimmed in the gilded auditorium, and a small choir walked onstage to sing “The First Noel,” the a cappella sound was glorious.
That was the prologue to the Classical Theater of Harlem’s Christmas musical, also called “The First Noel,” which had its premiere last year on the upstairs soundstage at the Apollo and has now moved onto the main stage. The good news is that the vocalists and the five-piece band are still terrific.
But the show — which has a book, music and lyrics by Lelund Durond Thompson and Jason Michael Webb — has also retained the flaws it had the first time around, and gained some new ones in the larger space.
The premise of “The First Noel” is grim. Noel (Nia Bonita Caesar), an 8-year-old named after the sister who died before she was born, longs to celebrate Christmas. Her still-mourning mother, Deloris (Soara-Joye Ross, in a curiously harsh performance), has never allowed that.
Directed by Steve H. Broadnax III, this is a memory musical, with the grown-up Noel (Ashley Ware Jenkins) returning to the brownstone where she grew up. She thinks back on the Christmas of ’85, when her father (a warm and lovely Ken Robinson) was a steadying presence, and her glamorous grandmother (Tina Fabrique) reappeared in her life.
The score, a pop-gospel-jazz mix of original and classic songs, is the pulse of the piece. But when the music stops, the show feels like a 1980s sitcom crossed with an after-school special. Dream sequences are not as lucid as they were last year, and genuinely comic elements don’t pop the way they did.
“The First Noel” wants to become an annual tradition. But to do that, it needs to grab us by the heart.
