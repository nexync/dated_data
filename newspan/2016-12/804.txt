The standoff over an oil pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in the American Midwest took a turn this week when the Army Corps of Engineers said it would reconsider the pipeline’s route.
As a part of the Department of the Army, its early projects involved forts. But the Corps’ most notable legacy may be making Great Lakes harbors safer and reducing river obstacles, a boon to the growing nation’s economy.
The Standing Rock protest stems from the pipeline’s planned routing under the Missouri River, raising Native American fears of an environmental catastrophe. When those happen, the Corps often responds, as it did in the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989.
The Corps has often been credited with a marvel that it didn’t actually build: the original Panama Canal, which transformed global trade.
The canal’s construction was, however, overseen by a famous member of the Corps, Gen. George Washington Goethals.
When he died in 1928, officials called the canal “a monument to one of the world’s greatest engineers.” He was buried at the United States Military Academy in New York, overlooking the Hudson River.
