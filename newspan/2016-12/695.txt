Blue-collar workers are losing their manufacturing jobs. Some are blaming immigrants. Politicians seem far away and out-of-touch.
That might sound like the news of the day, but it is also the subject of a play that is now heading for Broadway: “Sweat,” by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage.
The play, scheduled to begin performances at Studio 54 on March 4 and to open on March 26, will be a long-awaited Broadway debut for Ms. Nottage, whose searing drama about women in the Democratic Republic of Congo, “Ruined,” did not make it to Broadway despite winning the 2009 Pulitzer Prize.
Ms. Nottage said she was hopeful that a Broadway production would introduce her work to a wider audience.
“Sweat” has previously had productions at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and at Arena Stage in Washington. All of the productions have been directed by Kate Whoriskey, who will also direct the one on Broadway; the lead producers are Stuart Thompson and Louise Gund. Casting has not been announced, but the cast at the Public is expected to remain with the show.
