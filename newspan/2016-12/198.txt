Re “Nearly Half From U.S. in Poll Say Torture Can Be Useful” (news article, Dec. 5): It is troubling that 46 percent of Americans believe that torture can be used to extract information from an enemy combatant. In 1764, Cesare Beccaria’s founding work of modern legal philosophy, “On Crimes and Punishments,” called for the abolition of torture not only because it is immoral but also because it simply doesn’t work.
Thanks to Beccaria’s writings and those of other Enlightenment philosophers, many countries abolished torture in the 18th century, and it is now prohibited by international law. That so many Americans do not seem to be aware of this is alarming and suggests that our country is at risk of abandoning fundamental principles of justice.
We must educate and remain vigilant. As a historian of the 18th century, I think that it’s important to speak out.
