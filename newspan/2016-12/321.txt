It was a December some years ago when I hopped into a taxi on the Upper East Side, headed for a meeting across town.
I had a folder in my lap, filled with notes I needed to review before arriving â€” but, just my luck, a chatty driver. He peppered me with questions, about the weather, the holidays, the Rockefeller Center tree.
Finally, he took the hint, and we drove silently, me with my eyes fixed on my notes.
When the cab stopped, I reorganized my folder and reached for my wallet. Then I looked up. The Rockefeller Center tree in all its splendor, right there.
Quietly, together, we gazed. We smiled.
