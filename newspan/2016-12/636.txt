Mostly, I think, it would be particularly difficult for Ms. Merkel, whose decision to accept vast numbers of refugees from a troubled region increased Germanyâ€™s vulnerability to this kind of incident.
A wiser choice would have been to fund properly the refugee camps in countries near Syria, thus avoiding both the issue of economic migrants masquerading as refugees and the unwitting importation of the terrorism that currently afflicts the Islamic world.
Call it humanity with a brain.
