In “The Thin Gene” (Sunday Review, Nov. 27), Pagan Kennedy describes how research on a rare genetic mutation may improve our understanding of obesity: In people with this syndrome, a genetic deficiency of the hormone asprosin leads to low hunger levels, and researchers hope that a drug blocking this hormone, mimicking the genetic deficiency, could help people who are inclined to overeat stop overeating.
While such a drug may help some, people overeat for different reasons. Many hormonal and mechanical signals contribute to hunger and satiety, and physiological hunger signals are just one reason people eat. Psychological and social factors, some worsened by our diet-obsessed culture, also contribute to overeating.
Some people are able to decrease overeating by learning to “listen” for, detect and act on their natural hunger and satiety signals. This process defies the certainties of an effective drug, yet provides lifelong tools for health and self-care.
We must remember that genetics are just one dimension of a multidimensional issue.
