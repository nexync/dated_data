‘THE BAD SLEEP WELL’ at IFC Center (Dec. 23-27). Having married into a corporate family, an executive (Toshiro Mifune) masterminds a byzantine plot to avenge his father’s death in this 1960 thriller from Akira Kurosawa. The plot has a light dusting of “Hamlet,” but the movie — with its wide-screen, black-and-white compositions and its corrosive indictment of the Japanese business world — teems with a tragic grandeur distinct to Kurosawa.
‘CASABLANCA’ at Film Forum (Dec. 28-Jan. 3). To paraphrase Claude Rains’s Captain Renault: We suspect that Film Forum’s programmers, under their cynical shells, are at heart sentimentalists. “Casablanca” turns 75 in 2017, and to celebrate, the theater is hosting this weeklong revival engagement. On the heels of Robert Zemeckis’s underrated homage, “Allied,” which opened in November, it’s not a bad time for a rewatch. And the movie is showing on 35-millimeter film — a format we’ll be lucky to have around as time goes by. Noah Isenberg, a professor at the New School and the author of a book on “Casablanca,” will introduce the 7 p.m. screening on Dec. 29.
‘THE PRIVATE LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES’ at the Metrograph (Dec. 28, 5:30 p.m.). Arthur Conan Doyle and Billy Wilder might not sound like the most natural of combinations, but the author and director prove a harmonious match in this lovely, semi-revisionist 1970 look at the detective (Robert Stephens) of 221B Baker Street. At times a witty, even parodic film — Holmes considers the amount of dust that’s gathered on his desk to be an essential timepiece in his filing system — “The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes” naturally comes to involve a mystery, including a possible appearance by the Loch Ness monster. Still, the emphasis is more on Holmes the man, who troubles Dr. Watson (Colin Blakely) with his cocaine habit and is portrayed as having an ambiguous sexuality. Miklos Rozsa wrote the melancholy score.
