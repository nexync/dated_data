BEIJING — What if the Great Wall was built not to keep out northern invaders but to defend against mythical monsters?
Set in ancient China, the film centers on William Garin (Mr. Damon), a foreign mercenary who is taken captive by a secret army of elite fighters on the Great Wall called the Nameless Order. Garin and his sidekick (played by Pedro Pascal) soon learn that the wall was built to protect against mythical flesh-eating monsters called the taotie, who rise up every 60 years to devour humanity.
Reviews of the movie in China have so far been mixed. On Douban, a popular book and movie review website, the movie has an average rating of 5.4 stars out of 10 based on more than 82,000 ratings. Many of the reviewers — both professional and amateur — have expressed disappointment with Mr. Zhang, lamenting his turn from art house hits like “Raise the Red Lantern” to blatantly commercial, popcorn movies.
Still, other reviewers applauded the film for its dazzling effects and expressed excitement about the film’s potential to export Chinese culture to the rest of the world.
We rounded up reactions from Chinese filmgoers and critics writing for Chinese and Western outlets. Here are excerpts (including in some cases translated passages) from reviews from the upbeat to the negative.
I don’t care, I just want my Chinese style.
