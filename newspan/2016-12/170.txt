Nothing good has ever come of a bachelor party, but the one in “Siren” goes particularly awry. The movie is a not-great horror flick, but if it discourages one future groom from having a final ill-advised night of debauchery, it will have served a purpose.
The young man in question is Jonah (Chase Williamson), who is dragged out for a premarriage night on the town by some friends. The club they end up at is kind of drab, so they willingly follow a strange man (Justin Welborn) who promises them a livelier time.
He leads them to private quarters where Jonah encounters a woman, Lily, who seems as if she is being held as a sex slave, so he frees her. Big mistake; turns out she was locked up for a reason, and the men are soon running for their lives.
The film, directed by Gregg Bishop and released by the Chiller Films horror factory, has a few good special effects, but it’s too noisy and scattershot to be suspenseful. The movie is of interest primarily as an experiment in extrapolation. It’s an effort to make a full-length feature loosely based on one of the segments (“Amateur Night”) in the 2012 horror anthology “V/H/S,” with Hannah Fierman reprising her role as Lily. Fans of “V/H/S” will probably prefer that found-footage version to this standard-issue scripted one.
