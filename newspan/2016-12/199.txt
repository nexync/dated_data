I have experience as an attorney volunteer doing nonpartisan poll watching over the past 20 years in Albuquerque, Cleveland and San Francisco. Since every county conducts its own election under its own rules, with its own employees and trained volunteers, the idea of an overarching conspiracy that would allow millions of people to cast “illegal” votes in counties all over the country is logistically not possible.
Furthermore, the poll workers I have had the pleasure to know could not have been more hardworking, careful and observant of the exacting rules under which they operated. In order for millions of people to have voted illegally, many of these public servants would have had to consciously neglect their duties.
The willingness of prominent Republicans to throw poll workers under the bus to assuage Donald Trump’s fragile ego is beneath the dignity of their positions. An apology would be appropriate.
