1. The Box. Beginning in the 1960s the artist Donald Judd created a new vocabulary for sculpture by taking it off the plinth and placing it directly on the floor, making the space around the work part of the experience of seeing it. His signature was the box, often deployed serially with subtle variations to emphasize the geometric volumes. Unpainted plywood was a staple of his work, along with Plexiglas and metals like anodized aluminum.
2. 101 Spring Street. The cast-iron SoHo building that Judd bought in 1968 and transformed into one of the most understatedly stunning homes and studios in the city. Preserved as he left it, with his own pieces and those by artists he loved (Dan Flavin, David Novros, Frank Stella), the building is now open for public tours and hosts temporary art installations. More information is at juddfoundation.org.
3. Marfa. Judd established extensive permanent installations of his work and the work of artists he admired (John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, Ilya Kabakov) in this Texas town far from cities and airports, overseen by the Judd Foundation and the Chinati Foundation. Chinati.org.
4. Dia:Beacon. One of the largest collections outside Marfa of Juddâ€™s boxlike floor and wall sculptures, some made from plywood that seems almost too perfect and geometrically formed to be real. 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y. Diaart.org.
