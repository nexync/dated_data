FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Tom Brady says Michael Floyd’s fast-paced introduction to the New England Patriots’ offense is coming along well.
Floyd, a fifth-year receiver who was picked up by the Patriots (13-2) after the Cardinals released him following his arrest in Arizona on charges of driving under the influence, caught one pass late in last week’s 41-3 blowout of the Jets.
His contributions could increase on Sunday in Miami, with the rookie receiver Malcolm Mitchell questionable after missing practice all week with a knee injury, and Danny Amendola still out with an ankle sprain.
Brady said he could “definitely” feel Floyd’s experience factor after the receiver arrived.
“We’ve had a lot of guys come here who have been veterans and played a lot of football and played in the N.F.L., and there’s a big part of that, too, that you’ve got to gain confidence in,” Brady said.
There have been veteran receivers, like Joey Galloway and Chad Johnson, who have come to New England and failed to grasp the complicated playbook. Floyd seems to be doing fairly well.
Floyd, who has been putting in extra time with the third-string quarterback Jacoby Brissett, said he thought things had been progressing.
