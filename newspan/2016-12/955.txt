An art gallery, to open this month, has signed a five-year sublease for an 872-square-foot gallery space, with 30 feet of frontage, on the ground floor of this 12-story co-op built in 1935. The space, which sits across from the Museum of Modern Art, was formerly occupied by a rare-book shop.
This 27,340-square-foot seven-story building, with a basement, was originally built in 1913 as an eye surgery center, and has been occupied by a substance abuse treatment center since the 1980s. The tenant, whose approximate annual rent is about $900,000, is responsible for electricity, taxes and insurance costs. The cap rate is about 2.6 percent.
