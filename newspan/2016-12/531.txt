Natalie Gonnella-Platts, 32, is a deputy director of the George W. Bush Institute in Dallas.
Q. What is the George W. Bush Institute, and what is your role there?
A. We’re the nonpartisan, public policy arm of the George W. Bush Presidential Center, which also includes the presidential library and museum. I lead the Women’s Initiative, which promotes access to education, health care and economic opportunities for disadvantaged women.
I was always very interested in the world around me. When my mother and I would go to the library, I’d pull out a huge, atlas-type book to take home. I’d look at the pictures of the countries outside the U.S. and ask questions.
 My great-grandmother, a spitfire, co-founded a candy store in 1947 in Buffalo, where I was born. My mother always told me to follow the beat of my own drum, and my great-grandmother set a great example.
Initially I wanted to work in television journalism at the BBC. In college I majored in communications and international studies and minored in history and political science. I attended graduate school at the University of Sussex in England, where I got a degree in war, violence and security studies. After that I worked as an intern at the White House, where I was assigned to the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. I also volunteered at events like the Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn and Pope Benedict’s visit.
Have you traveled much since working here?
This year I’ve traveled to Tanzania, Ethiopia, Denmark and England for the First Ladies Initiative, which includes first ladies from around the world. We’ve held events like round tables, summits and workshops. I’ve come away from these visits realizing the value of women’s leadership to change lives.
What have you gotten personally from your work with first ladies?
To hear what these women have accomplished before assuming their role and how they’ve applied their expertise and passion to make a difference has been so inspiring.
