The Giants have every reason to think they will clinch their first playoff berth since the 2011 season. They have won eight of their last nine games, and they are playing a team that has ridden a five-game losing streak straight out of contention.
But Philadelphia has been neither brotherly nor loving to Giants quarterback Eli Manning, who has a 10-17 career record, with 29 interceptions, against this N.F.C. East rival. He has lost in five of his past seven trips to Philadelphia.
Then again, the Eagles have given up at least 26 points in each game of their free fall. A short practice week does not allow the time needed to shore up holes that size.
