DAKAR, Senegal — Gambians on Saturday braced themselves for a period of tense uncertainty after President Yahya Jammeh announced that he rejected the results of an election that ousted him from office and demanded a new vote.
Last week, Mr. Jammeh conceded in a televised address to Gambia’s population that he had lost the race to Mr. Barrow. Then late Friday night, Mr. Jammeh appeared again on state television and suddenly reversed himself, citing what he said were voter irregularities that he said sullied the race’s results.
Criticism of Mr. Jammeh’s announcement has poured in from human rights groups, the African Union and the United States. The government of Senegal, a nation that surrounds Gambia on three sides, called for an emergency United Nations Security Council meeting.
Reports that the Senegalese military might intervene circulated in Gambia, but a Senegalese military spokesman, Sgt. Moustapha Diatta, disputed that any plans for intervention were in the works.
Isatou Touray, a member of Gambia’s opposition coalition, called on Mr. Jammeh to step down immediately.
On Friday, a top military intelligence official close to the president said many high-ranking military and police officers favored handing over power to Mr. Barrow. But, he added, at least some stationed near the president were aligned with Mr. Jammeh.
In the hours after results came in last week, Mr. Jammeh was reluctant to accept that he was losing, according to the military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the issue. Mr. Jammeh had even asked key advisers to annul votes.
When he appealed to a gathering of top advisers and officials and asked them to discredit the results, they told him chaos would break out if they did so. A heated argument broke out, but eventually, Mr. Jammeh agreed to concede, according to the official.
