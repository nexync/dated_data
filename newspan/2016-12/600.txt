The Office of Government Ethics, charged with helping executive branch public servants avoid criminal conflicts of interest, heralded this decision. Mr. Trump canceled his big sell-off presser early this week, saying he was too busy building his cabinet. Instead on Thursday, another tweet, in which he said absolutely nothing about divesting himself of his interests and instead blamed the news media for making it an issue in the first place.
In minimizing the problem, Mr. Trump shows he’s in no mood to give up his businesses. At least not now. Maybe after the Electoral College votes on Monday. Maybe after the inauguration. Maybe never.
Mr. Trump has to know that divesting is more, much more, than “visually important.” Shortly after the election, his lawyer visited the Office of Government Ethics. The agency told the lawyer that keeping his businesses, while legal, would present Mr. Trump with multiple conflicts and create fodder for investigations that could cripple his administration. Its advice was to sell the businesses and not use family members as a fig leaf to hide continuing involvement.
It appears now that the only thing Mr. Trump absorbed from this advice was that it is legal for him to keep his holdings — holdings that exist in many countries and in many industries with foreign partners who are already currying favor with him. He’s noted that after years of ups and downs, his election victory is bringing big money into his businesses. And he seems not at all worried that these involvements could lead him to break the law, by accepting improper gifts or payments from foreign governments.
As of now, Mr. Trump aims to keep every asset in the family, to the great detriment of what he rightly identifies as the “far more important task” of his presidency.
