Mike Dunleavy, a former N.B.A. coach, was looking to get back into coaching in March 2015 when he heard that St. John’s had parted ways with Steve Lavin. Five years removed from his last job on a bench, he reached out to an old friend, Chris Mullin, about the opening, to see if Mullin would vouch for him as a reference.
Dunleavy, 62, who ended up at Tulane, and Mullin, 53, renewed their acquaintance Friday night when St. John’s (3-5) beat Tulane (1-7), 95-75, in New Orleans. Both teams had five-game losing streaks entering the game.
Even though Dunleavy is nine years older than Mullin, the men have much in common.
Both are from Brooklyn and played in the N.B.A. Both went on to become Western Conference executives in the N.B.A., Dunleavy as the Los Angeles Clippers’ general manager and Mullin in the front offices of the Golden State Warriors and the Sacramento Kings. Both were eventually hired to restore prominence to a college program.
And both are now struggling for wins.
Dunleavy, who spent more than two decades as an N.B.A. coach, has coached only eight games in college, and he acknowledged that he was still getting his feet under him while trying to establish a culture and recruit effectively.
Mullin, who was 8-24 in his first season as the St. John’s coach, is off to another rough start this season. The most recent indignity? A 79-72 loss Tuesday to a Delaware State team that had not beaten a Division I opponent this season.
Mullin was 98-30 as a player at St. John’s. His next defeat, will be his 30th as the program’s coach.
Perhaps not surprisingly, given their coaches’ roots, Tulane and St. John’s are looking to build their teams — at least in part — via an infusion of talent from the New York area. Dunleavy has scored two major steals by winning commitments from the 6-foot-9 Bul Ajang and the 7-foot Buay Koka of the Patrick School in Hillside, N.J., which produced the N.B.A. players Kyrie Irving and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist when it was St. Patrick High School. At St. John’s, Mullin is pursuing several highly regarded, but younger, prospects from the region.
Dunleavy and Mullin are also part of a larger trend in which colleges seek out coaches with N.B.A. experience. The former Dallas Mavericks and Nets coach Avery Johnson is in his second year at Alabama. Eric Musselman, who had jobs with six N.B.A. franchises, is in his second season at Nevada, and the former All-Star guard Mark Price is in his second season at North Carolina-Charlotte.
The results have been mixed. Johnson took Alabama to the National Invitation Tournament in his first year and is 4-2 this season. He also has the fifth-ranked recruiting class in the nation for 2017, according to Scout.com.
Under Musselman, Nevada won the College Basketball Invitational, a lower-tier postseason tournament, last season. And while Price and Charlotte were 14-19 a year ago, they are off to a 5-2 start now.
Mullin and Dunleavy, meanwhile, are, for the moment, struggling to find their footing.
“We’re both from Brooklyn, we both grew up in the playgrounds there, we’re both really competitive guys,” Dunleavy said. “We both probably played the game, not professionally, but a lot longer than most people. I think he probably still plays. My knee is not good enough to allow me to play, but I go out and shoot, fool around because I just love it.
