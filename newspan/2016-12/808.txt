The play, Reuters reported, features a profane 45-year-old woman who recently served time in prison for murdering her husband, the Grinch, with whom she has a daughter.
Mr. Lombardo, whose play “High” ran on Broadway in 2010 starring Kathleen Turner, is seeking $130,000 in damages, including costs for the cancellation of “Who’s Holiday!” It was to begin performances Off Broadway at New World Stages on Nov. 2.
