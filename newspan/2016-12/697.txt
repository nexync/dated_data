Milt Moss, a comic actor who delivered the rueful catchphrase “I can’t believe I ate that whole thing” in a memorable commercial for Alka-Seltzer in 1972, died on Sept. 26 in Manhattan. He was 93.
His nephew Roger Fox announced the death last Wednesday.
Mr. Moss was a nightclub comedian and master of ceremonies in the tradition of Henny Youngman. His comedy was based around well-trodden one-liners, bits and impersonations.
He opened for performers like the singer Robert Goulet and appeared on television with Milton Berle, Merv Griffin and Johnny Carson. He was also known as a master of the put-on, convincing unwitting audiences at official events that he was a legitimate speaker, like a chief executive or an ambassador, and then slowly veering from the reasonable into the absurd before revealing that he was a comedian.
The commercial struck a chord with dyspeptic viewers around the country, and in 1977 it was admitted to the advertising industry’s Clio Awards Hall of Fame. The advertisement made Mr. Moss recognizable to a national audience, helping him book more conventions, club dates and TV appearances.
“That commercial changed my whole life,” Mr. Moss told the television historian Kliph Nesteroff in an interview in 2011.
Milton Moss was born in the Bronx on Oct. 25, 1922, to Anton Moss and the former Eva Goldstein. His father was a comedian who performed as Eddie Clarke.
Mr. Moss attended N.Y.U. after graduating from high school. He then served in the Army from 1942 until 1945, entertaining troops at a facility in Belgium during World War II, and after his discharge turned to comedy and acting full time.
He married Dorothy Gorman in 1956. She died in 2000. No immediate family members survive.
