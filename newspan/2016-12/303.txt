THE HOLLOW CROWN: THE WARS OF THE ROSES 9 p.m. on PBS. Benedict Cumberbatch, in the title role of Shakespeare’s “Richard III,” maneuvers his way to the throne by plotting the murder of his brother George. Then there’s the problem of the two little princes in the tower. “Call the Midwife Holiday Special,” in which the nuns of Nonnatus House travel to South Africa to save a free clinic threatened with closure, leads in at 7:30.
I LOVE LUCY CHRISTMAS SPECIAL 8 p.m. on CBS. Two classics — “The Christmas Episode” and “Lucy Gets in Pictures” — are colorized in vintage hues.
THE RETURN OF DOCTOR MYSTERIO 9 p.m. on BBC America. This “Doctor Who” Christmas special pairs the Doctor (Peter Capaldi) and Nardole (Matt Lucas) with a mysterious superhero to save Manhattan from brain-swapping aliens. But what lurks behind the mask?
CATASTROPHE on Amazon. Season 1 of this sweet and filthy British comedy found Sharon and Rob — the Irish schoolteacher (played by Sharon Horgan) and the American ad man (Rob Delaney) — consciously coupling in London after a weeklong hookup led to an unplanned pregnancy. In Season 2 they’re coping with a baby sister for the toddler, Frankie, and the attendant struggles: postpartum ick, a visiting monster-in-law (Carrie Fisher) and a languishing career. And sex, or the lack thereof. “‘Catastrophe’ has the raw honesty of a mom on her second martini at a play date,” James Poniewozik wrote in The Times.
