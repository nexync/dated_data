This week on the Billboard album chart, Alexander Hamilton topped Mick Jagger, and a ukulele-playing 12-year-old cracked the Top 10.
“The Hamilton Mixtape” (Atlantic), a long-awaited album featuring a variety of artists — including Kelly Clarkson, Chance the Rapper, Sia and the Roots — performing songs from the Broadway smash “Hamilton,” opened at No. 1 with 169,000 sales and 21 million streams in the United States, according to Nielsen. That was more than enough to beat the Rolling Stones’s latest, “Blue & Lonesome” (Interscope), which landed at No. 4 with 120,000 sales and 2.8 million streams.
The new “Hamilton” album has been long anticipated by fans, and reached higher on the chart than the original cast album had. That album, which came out in September 2015, peaked at No. 3, although it has been a steady hit, selling 876,000 copies and reaching No. 11 on this week’s chart.
Also this week, Pentatonix, the quirky a cappella group, has two holiday albums in the Top 10. Its latest, “A Pentatonix Christmas” (RCA), falls one spot to No. 3, while “That’s Christmas to Me” (RCA), released two years ago, is now No. 7.
Childish Gambino, the hip-hop stage name of the actor Donald Glover, opens at No. 5 with his new “Awaken, My Love!” (Glassnote). Two other new releases reached the bottom rungs of the Top 10: “Perfectly Imperfect” (Columbia/Syco), the debut mini-album by Grace VanderWaal, the 12-year-old winner of the most recent season of “America’s Got Talent,” bows at No. 9, and the country singer Kane Brown opens at No. 10 with his self-titled release, on RCA Nashville/Zone 4.
