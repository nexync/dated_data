The holiday season can be both a time to count blessings and a period that heightens feelings of sadness, which makes this a fitting moment for “Every Brilliant Thing,” a filmed version of the one-man stage show that the British comedian Jonny Donahoe has been performing for several years.
The broadcast, Monday, Dec. 26, on HBO, captures Mr. Donahoe’s performance last year at the Barrow Street Theater in New York as he narrates the story of a young boy whose response to his mother’s first suicide attempt is to start making “a list of everything that’s brilliant about the world.” By the time the boy has reached adulthood the list has thousands of entries, but he is dealing with his own demons. The piece isn’t autobiographical — it’s adapted from a short story by Duncan Macmillan — but Mr. Donahoe’s heartfelt performance earns him the credibility to speak on a difficult subject. And, surprisingly, the show is full of humor, not to mention delightful audience participation.
