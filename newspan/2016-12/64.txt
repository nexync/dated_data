BEIJING — A well-known Chinese human rights activist who had not been seen or heard from for more than three weeks is in police custody, accused of possessing secret government documents and spiriting them abroad, state-run news outlets said on Friday.
The activist, Jiang Tianyong, is a disbarred lawyer who has energetically supported the families of human rights lawyers caught in a crackdown that began in July 2015. Mr. Jiang’s family and friends lost contact with him on Nov. 21.
It appears likely that Mr. Jiang, 45, will join a long list of Chinese rights advocates who have been detained, discredited and in some cases imprisoned as a warning to others not to embrace dissent.
About 250 lawyers and activists were detained in the crackdown last year. Most were released, but about 17 were arrested and in some cases tried and imprisoned on subversion and other charges, according to estimates by Amnesty International.
The Chinese news reports said Mr. Jiang had been held under “criminal coercive measures” since Dec. 1. Those measures give the police vaguely defined powers to hold suspects secretively.
The reports said the police had notified Mr. Jiang’s family about his case. “That’s simply a lie,” Mr. Poon said.
