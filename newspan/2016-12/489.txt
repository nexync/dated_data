Reporters are debating how to handle Donald Trump’s tweets. Surely this is the first time in history that the press has been forced to consider whether to take seriously the statements of any current or future president. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t understand the consequences.
There will come a time when he will have to deliver a serious message to the American people from the Oval Office. It may be about a horrible tragedy, a natural disaster, an armed conflict, a terrorist attack, a change in policy or some national emergency.
At that time, we won’t know if he is telling the truth, if he knows the truth, if he understands what he is talking about, or if he is trying to manipulate us or bully someone. We will have to wait for people whom we can trust and believe to vet and confirm or correct anything he says.
How can he lead us or protect us if we can’t believe him or trust his judgment? This cyberbullying just erodes what little credibility he has left.
As he heads to the White House, Donald Trump should stop tweeting and start studying.
