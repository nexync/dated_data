“They’re Harvesting Government History, One Web Page at a Time,” by Jim Dwyer (About New York column, Dec. 2), draws attention to a critical issue in government transparency and accountability.
This effort by a group of librarians and archivists to ensure that federal government websites are preserved for current and future use is laudable. But given the enormous presence of electronic government documentation, it is essential to our democracy that systematic attention be given by the government to ensuring that this information is captured rather than relying on individual citizen initiatives.
Further, we need to ensure that state government and local government websites are comparably addressed. Some states, including New York, Virginia, North Carolina and Kentucky, already conduct active programs harvesting state government websites. Nonetheless, many more go undocumented, and very few local governments are attending to this issue.
Individual citizens should urge their respective state and local governments to ensure the preservation of essential government documentation provided through their websites and then be vigilant in demanding accountability from those governments on this issue.
