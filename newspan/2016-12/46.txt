Thank you to Janet Napolitano for “The Truth About Dreamers” (Op-Ed, Nov. 30). My experience has been with Dreamers who have made it to medical school and who want to give back to the country that has been their home since childhood.
We should all welcome a softer stance by President-elect Donald Trump on their status; many contribute to our society in constructive and even essential ways.
The Dreamers I know are working very hard to care for the poor in free clinics, to fix the congenital deformities in children similar to the ones they had that led to their parents’ decisions to bring them to the United States, and to treat mental illness in areas sorely lacking in such care.
They are not here to take or hurt or damage. They are compassionate contributors. It would be a loss to all of us if they are sent away.
