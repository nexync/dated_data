Last month’s presidential election exposed the gulf between the technology industry and much of the rest of the country. It put the spotlight on how Silicon Valley tech companies have lived in a bubble in recent years, with job and wealth creation from the industry largely confined to a narrow geographic region around the San Francisco Bay Area.
So Quentin Hardy, a tech reporter at The New York Times, traveled to Oklahoma recently to report on how Google’s building of data centers there may have spread tech’s largess beyond Silicon Valley. What he found was a very uneven scene.
In the town of Pryor, Okla., about 40 miles from Tulsa, Google has a giant computing complex that was built in 2010 and will be expanded. While the center does not bring a lot of jobs because it is highly automated, Google has become the local county’s biggest taxpayer. The company has also worked to create ties with the community, donating Chromebooks to schools, money toward education programs and other perks.
That enabled Pryor to give accredited teachers a bonus recently. Pryor’s schools have Wi-Fi and collaboration software and sparkling new classrooms. They hold academic competitions and other events.
All good, right? Yet Quentin also found that this tech largess quickly reaches its limits.
Just 25 miles south of Pryor, in the town of Wagoner, the situation is very different. Without the Google jackpot, schools there have few resources, and classrooms are crowded. The schools are struggling just to supply the basics, such as textbooks.
“It’s pretty obvious that we are the have-nots,” Randy Harris, superintendent of Wagoner schools, told Quentin.
