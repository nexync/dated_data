But that is the challenge for an all-star team making a musical version of “Mean Girls,” a 2004 cult teen comedy movie. The show is scheduled to have a world premiere production in the fall at the National Theater in Washington, a spokesman for the musical said on Friday.
The creative team includes the comedic writer and actress Tina Fey, who wrote the film’s screenplay; “Saturday Night Live” producer Lorne Michaels, who produced the film and will produce the show with Broadway veteran Stuart Thompson (“The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time”); and the director Casey Nicholaw (“Aladdin,” “The Book of Mormon”).
Setting to music so many memorable bits of high school banter — “You can’t sit with us,” “That’s why her hair is so big, it’s full of secrets” and “On Wednesdays, we wear pink” — will be the composer Jeff Richmond, who is married to Ms. Fey. Nell Benjamin (“Legally Blonde”) is writing the lyrics. The musical will have a developmental lab in April.
All of which means this team may not have much time to realize the wishes of the film’s star, Lindsay Lohan, who expressed her desire this week to pursue a sequel.
