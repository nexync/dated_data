James Elrod, an all-American defensive end on Oklahoma’s 1974 and 1975 national championship teams, died in a car crash on Monday. He was 62.
The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said Elrod was killed when his car struck a guardrail about 3:45 a.m. on Interstate 44 near Chandler, Okla. He was thrown through the sunroof. His wife, Diana, was in the car and was hospitalized in serious condition, the University of Oklahoma said.
Elrod was not wearing a seatbelt, the patrol said, but his wife was.
His coach at Oklahoma, Barry Switzer, told The Tulsa World that Elrod and his wife had traveled to Las Vegas with the country music star Toby Keith. After watching Keith’s performance, the Elrods returned to Norman early Monday on Keith’s private plane and began their drive home to Tulsa.
Elrod, who was known as Jimbo, played three years in the N.F.L. with the Kansas City Chiefs as a middle linebacker. He also spent one season with the Houston Oilers.
Under Switzer, Oklahoma’s 1974 team went undefeated, with a record of 11-0. The 1975 squad went 11-1, defeating Michigan in the Orange Bowl.
Elrod was also a member of Oklahoma’s 1974 national champion wrestling team.
James Whittington Elrod was born on May 25, 1954, in Memphis and grew up in Tulsa, where he was a standout player at East Central High School.
There was no immediate information on his survivors besides his wife. The Tulsa World said he had a daughter, Chanel, who was recently a cheerleader at Oklahoma.
