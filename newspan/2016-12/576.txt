Here’s a look at some of the key figures from the new report.
That’s the total number of fatal workplace injuries in 2015, the highest since 2008, when such injuries resulted in 5,214 deaths.
That’s the number of transportation-related episodes that resulted in fatalities, accounting for about 42 percent of all workplace deaths.
That’s the number of Hispanic or Latino workers who died in 2015, approximately two-thirds of them foreign-born. More Hispanics or Latinos died from workplace injuries in 2015 than in any year since 2007, when the number for the group was 937.
Workers 65 years and older died at higher rates last year than their peers in any other age group. With 650 deaths for those senior workers, 2015 was the second-worst year for the age group since the data was first collected in 1992. Only last year’s total, 684, was larger.
That’s the decline in the number of workplace suicides from 2014. The homicide rate rose 2 percent. Over the last five years, both declined.
