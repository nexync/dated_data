NEW ORLEANS — Anthony Davis is scoring less lately and could not be happier about it.
Davis had 23 points and 18 rebounds, and the New Orleans Pelicans won their fourth straight game, 104-92, over the Knicks on Friday night.
Carmelo Anthony had 26 points and 13 rebounds but could not prevent the Knicks from dropping their third straight. Kristaps Porzingis had 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Derrick Rose added 20 points. No other players contributed more than 8 points for the Knicks, who shot just 37.6 percent.
But Rose did not sound as concerned with the Knicks’ offense as with how they played on the other end.
Joakim Noah, who did not score in 16 minutes and finished with six rebounds, was limited by early foul trouble and had difficulty guarding Davis.
There have been 10 games this season in which Davis scored between 31 and 50 points in a loss. His high during New Orleans’s current winning streak is 28 points.
Six New Orleans players scored 10 points or more, including the reserve guard Tyreke Evans, whose 16 points were his best output in seven games since returning from right knee surgery. Jrue Holiday had 12 points and 11 assists.
The Pelicans led by as many as 15 after a 13-0 run early in the second half during which the Knicks missed 11 straight shots, including four misses by Anthony.
