Samantha Robin Zins, the daughter of Patricia Corren Zins and Dr. Jonathan H. Zins of Westport, Conn., was married Dec. 10 to Logan Stewart Lowe, a son of Lauren Silbert Lowe and Dr. Franklin C. Lowe of Manhattan. Rabbi Robert N. Levine officiated at the Lighthouse at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan.
Mrs. Lowe, 29, is a director in the business development and investor relations group at Solus Alternative Asset Management, a hedge fund in Manhattan. She graduated from Washington University in St. Louis.
The brideâ€™s father, a retired radiologist, was a partner in Advanced Radiology Consultants of Bridgeport, Conn., and worked in its Fairfield County offices.
Mr. Lowe, 31, is a partner and a portfolio manager, focusing on mortgage-backed securities, at the Manhattan office of Prophet Capital Asset Management, a hedge fund in Austin, Tex. He graduated cum laude from Princeton.
His father is a professor of urology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the director of urologic services at Jack D. Weiler Hospital, which are part of Montefiore Medical Center, both in the Bronx.
The couple met in summer 2011 through mutual friends at a party, but they did not begin dating until two years later, when those friends organized a group dinner at SushiSamba, a Japanese-Peruvian restaurant in Manhattan.
