In the days after the presidential election, Jessa Blades, an herbalist and makeup artist in Brooklyn who supported Hillary Clinton, was devastated. “All I could think to do was blend a tea to control my stress,” she said.
Ms. Blades, 37, mixed three pounds of lemon balm, nettle, chamomile, rose and oats together “for soothing the nervous system, calming, giving the right amount of boundaries and opening the heart” and put it in brown paper bags with “love for you and the world” written on the front. She gave them out to friends with instructions to use the combination for self-care.
In recent weeks, though, self-care has often been invoked as a way of dealing with open-ended anxiety.
The term has been inescapable online. A search on Google Trends showed that self-care peaked in search interest popularity from Nov. 13 through Nov. 19, the largest increase in the last five years.
The singling out of self-care as a concept is hardly recent. In 1976, the French philosopher Michel Foucault, in his treatise “The Care of the Self,” wrote that “the idea that one ought to attend to oneself, care for oneself” was a theme in the classical world and a practice that conditions one to care for others.
