A. The protective reflex of sneezing when exposed to bright light has not been heavily researched, even though it affects an estimated 18 percent to 35 percent of the population. That is because most people do not find it to be a serious problem, with many ignoring it, assuming that everyone reacts the same way they do.
A 2005 study of electroencephalograms of brain activity, in the journal PLOS One, suggested that the reflex is unusual in involving specific higher brain areas governing vision and sensation, rather than a classical reflex that happens at the level of the brainstem or spinal cord.
