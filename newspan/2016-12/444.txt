Petra Kvitova could return to tennis in about six months, the surgeon who operated on her left hand said Wednesday.
Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, was injured Tuesday when a knife-wielding intruder attacked her at her home in Prostejov, Czech Republic. The attacker is still at large, and the police have asked the public for help.
Kvitova underwent nearly four hours of surgery on Tuesday at a specialized clinic in Vysoke nad Jizerou.

Malik Monk’s 3-point attempt to tie the score for Kentucky (10-2) bounced off the front of the rim with three seconds left, and Deng Adel grabbed the rebound to seal the win for Louisville (11-1).

FOOTBALL SPAT LED TO KILLING, POLICE SAY The authorities in Austin, Tex., said a woman’s exuberance over the Dallas Cowboys’ victory Sunday night led her stepson to fatally stab her.

Detectives said that her stepson, Pontrey O’Neal Jones, 20, believed she was disrespecting his father, so he walked behind a couch, lunged at his stepmother and stabbed her several times.
It seems that University of Texas football fans turned to alcohol to cope with a less than successful product on the field at Royal-Memorial Stadium.

The Longhorns finished 5-7 this season, in sixth place in the Big 12.
