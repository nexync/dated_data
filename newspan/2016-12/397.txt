J. A. Bayona has made a specialty of slyly inserting family dramas into genre films. This Spanish filmmaker spun a creepy horror movie with a family drama at its center for his first feature, “The Orphanage.” And he staged a destructive tsunami that pulls a family apart (and together) in the thriller “The Impossible.” In “A Monster Calls,” in theaters Friday, Dec. 23, he returns to family drama again, this time mixing in fantasy to tell the story of how the 12-year-old Conor copes with his mother’s terminal illness when he is visited by a treelike monster.
What all of his films have in common is a strong sense of the visual. The new movie includes devastating images of destruction and beautiful, imaginative images of candy-colored skies in a majestic kingdom.
Here is a closer look at the film’s visuals and how Hollywood musicals and Goya paintings inspired them.
Conor is obsessed with drawing and creates illustrations to deal with his anger. Those drawings, lining the wall by his desk, include wild animals, terrifying creatures and heroic figures fighting adversaries. This story arc wasn’t in the novel; Mr. Bayona added it to give Conor a way to connect “the spiritual side of his psychology with the world of fantasy,” he said, explaining that the film uses art as a way to combat death. The first time the monster visits, there’s a close-up of Conor’s pencil as he draws, the sound of the pencil almost summoning the monster. As the film progresses, his drawing becomes even more inventive, including a sketch that uses shavings from a sharpened pencil as a kind of pop-up crown for a regal figure.
