Q. I am on the board of a small co-op in Midtown Manhattan. For the past year, a shareholder has had frequent and noisy sexual encounters in his apartment, making it difficult for the superintendent, who lives in the apartment below, to sleep. After the super complained to the shareholder and to the board, the shareholder began harassing her. He would ring her bell as he entered the building, sometimes at 3 or 4 in the morning, awakening her before his noisy assignations began. Because the shareholder is a lawyer, the board members are afraid that if we confront him he will retaliate against the board and individual members. How can we stop his uncivil behavior?
A. I understand your fear of retribution from a person who has shown a tendency to bully others, but the board has a responsibility to protect its employees. Your neighbor’s loud trysts might violate your building’s noise rules, but more important, his behavior toward the super could violate the law.
The shareholder’s actions could potentially be considered harassment, which is a crime. The board is the super’s employer. So, if the board knows that its employee is being harassed in the workplace and does nothing to address a hostile work environment, it could be held liable.
It does not matter that the shareholder is a lawyer or litigious — he needs to be confronted. The super could call the police the next time she is awakened by late-night partying, but the board should also intervene. The board’s lawyer or property manager should send the shareholder a firm letter addressing both the harassment and the late-night escapades.
Another point to consider: “Loud sex violates the prohibition against making disturbing noises,” and ringing the doorbell violates the rights, comforts and convenience clause of the proprietary lease, said Marc J. Luxemburg, a partner at the law firm Gallet Dreyer & Berkey.
