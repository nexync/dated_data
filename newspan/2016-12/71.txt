A plane bound for Germany was diverted to Kennedy International Airport on Monday as the authorities investigated a bomb threat called in about the flight.
Officials evacuated about 500 passengers from Lufthansa Flight 441, which was headed from Houston to Frankfurt before it landed at Kennedy just after 8:30 p.m.
“They’re searching the plane from top to bottom,” said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
The flight was canceled, Mr. Coleman said.
The plane was diverted after a bomb threat was called in to a Lufthansa office, Mr. Coleman said. It was moved to a remote area of the airport for a search, and the evacuation did not disrupt activities or other flights at the airport, he said.
The passengers were taken to a terminal while the aircraft was searched, the airline said. “The safety and security of our passengers, crew and aircraft are always our highest priority,” Lufthansa said.
The threat was being investigated by the Port Authority Police Department Emergency Services Unit and the New York Police Department Bomb Squad, Mr. Coleman said.
