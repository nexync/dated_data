It was an innocent enough idea, but became more complicated in practice. Unsurprisingly, there were logistical problems — an “Autopsy” party had to be delayed because “we were having a really hard time getting a dead body,” McGinness said — and the usual riffraff. (“‘Vogue Ball’ got a little out of control.”) But there were also a few more unexpected problems. The second party McGinness hosted was called “Shoot the Freak,” based on an attraction at Coney Island that is more or less what it sounds like. The artist set up a shooting range and equipped visitors with paintball guns.
