Deshaun Watson bolstered his Heisman Trophy hopes by passing for three touchdowns and running for two more on Saturday night to lead No. 3 Clemson to a 42-35 victory over No. 19 Virginia Tech in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game in Orlando, Fla.
The victory, which gave Clemson consecutive league titles for the first time in 28 years, is likely to send the Tigers (12-1, 7-1) back to the four-team College Football Playoff for the second straight year, providing Watson with an opportunity to resolve unfinished business from last January, when his team lost to Alabama in the national championship game.
Watson completed 23 of 34 passes for 288 yards, including touchdowns of 21 and 10 yards to Jordan Leggett and one of 15 yards to Hunter Renfrow for a 42-28 lead midway through the fourth quarter. Watson rushed for 85 yards on 17 attempts for the Tigers, who won back-to-back A.C.C. titles for the first time since taking three straight from 1986 to 1988.
Virginia Tech quarterback Jerod Evans was just as impressive. The 6-foot-3, 238-pound Evans ran for two touchdowns and rallied the Hokies from a 21-point deficit to make it close at the end.
The Hokies (9-4, 6-2) scored on three straight possessions, trimming a 35-14 deficit to 7 points on Evans’s 5-yard run early in the fourth quarter and Cam Phillips’s 26-yard touchdown reception with a little less than six minutes remaining.
Virginia Tech got the ball back with a chance to force overtime. Evans drove the Hokies to the Clemson 23-yard line, where the drive stalled when Tigers cornerback Cordrea Tankersley intercepted a pass on fourth-and-6.
ALABAMA 54, FLORIDA 16 This was merely an annoyance for Alabama, a chance to add another prize to its overflowing trophy cases. The Crimson Tide did just enough things wrong to give Coach Nick Saban something to complain about during the next month, but in the end, it was another dominating victory for the nation’s No. 1 team.
Florida Coach Jim McElwain was impressed after his No. 15 Gators absorbed a whipping in the Southeastern Conference championship game in Atlanta. He called it Saban’s best team yet in a dynasty that shows no signs of stumbling.
“I don’t see a lot of weaknesses,” said McElwain, who was Saban’s offensive coordinator from 2008 to 2011.
Alabama (13-0, 8-0) unleashed all its weapons against the overmatched Gators, scoring on an interception and a blocked punt in the first half, snuffing out Florida’s last gasp with a goal-line stand, and wearing down the Gators at the end with a dominant running game.
The Tide now head to the College Football Playoff for the third year in a row, most likely returning to Atlanta for a semifinal game on Dec. 31. Alabama will be seeking its second straight national title and its fifth in eight seasons. Saban already has five national titles, counting his first at Louisiana State, and is one short of Bear Bryant’s record for the most by any coach.
The Crimson Tide raced to a 16-9 lead in the first quarter, despite being held to minus-7 yards and no first downs. Minkah Fitzpatrick returned an interception 44 yards for a touchdown, and Josh Jacobs went 27 yards for a score after a blocked punt. A field goal was set up by another interception, one of three thrown by Florida quarterback Austin Appleby in the first half.
The Tide led, 33-16, at halftime, and iced the win with scoring drives of 98 and 91 yards, keyed by a goal-line stand that finished off the Gators (8-4, 6-2). It was the most points surrendered by Florida since a 62-24 loss to Nebraska in the January 1996 Fiesta Bowl.
A 24-point underdog, the Gators marched the length of the field on their opening possession, the first touchdown given up by the Tide in more than 17 quarters. They had another long scoring drive near the end of the first half.
OKLAHOMA 38, OKLAHOMA ST. 20 Baker Mayfield passed for 288 yards and three touchdowns at home, and No. 7 Oklahoma (10-2, 9-0) defeated No. 11 Oklahoma State (9-3, 7-2) in a matchup that decided the Big 12 champion and most likely guaranteed the Sooners a trip to the Sugar Bowl.
Mayfield, a Heisman Trophy candidate, performed well, despite finishing the game without his top receiver, Dede Westbrook, who is a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award. Westbrook caught four passes for 111 yards before being knocked out of the game with concussion-like symptoms after a hard hit by Cowboys safety Jordan Sterns.
Oklahoma’s response to Westbrook’s injury was similar to way the Sooners have bounced back throughout a season plagued by injuries.
“I’m just incredibly pleased with our team, their resilience through the season and in this game,” said Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops.
Samaje Perine ran for 239 yards on a career-high 37 carries, and Joe Mixon caught a touchdown pass and had a 79-yard touchdown run for the Sooners.
TEMPLE 34, NAVY 10 Phillip Walker threw two touchdown passes, visiting Temple’s defense stuffed Navy’s running game, and the Owls (10-3, 7-1) claimed their first American Athletic Conference title by crushing the No. 20 Midshipmen (9-3, 7-1).
After Temple scored touchdowns on its first three possessions, protecting its 21-0 lead became easier when Navy lost quarterback Will Worth to a second-quarter ankle injury.
The Midshipmen’s coach, Ken Niumatalolo, said Worth is done for the season, along with running backs Toneo Gulley and Darryl Bonner, both of whom left with first-half injuries.
Although the defeat took Navy out of the running for the Cotton Bowl, the Midshipmen are expected to play in the Armed Forces Bowl after their game against Army next Saturday.
The Owls extended their winning streak to seven games and earned their first league title since finishing atop the Middle Atlantic Conference in 1967.
“It showed we have a really good team that is capable of doing a lot of good things,” said Walker, who finished 16 of 25 for 199 yards.
Temple lost to Houston in last year’s A.A.C. championship game. This time, the Owls dominated from the outset.
Not only did Temple open with touchdown drives of 75, 59 and 70 yards, but its defense derailed a Navy attack that was averaging 61 points in its previous three games.
The Midshipmen had scored on 34 of 38 drives — including 33 touchdowns — before being denied on their first three possessions by the Owls. Worth was injured at the end of the third drive and did not return.
That spelled doom for an offense that produced more than 500 yards in each of its past three games. Navy finished with 306 yards, 168 on the ground.
SAN DIEGO ST. 27, WYOMING 24 Rashaad Penny rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns, Donnel Pumphrey added 110 yards and a score, and San Diego State (10-3, 6-2) edged host Wyoming (8-5, 6-2) to win its second consecutive Mountain West Conference title.
Penny also gained 113 yards on two kickoff returns and added 13 receiving yards for a total of 243 all-purpose yards for the Aztecs.
W. KENTUCKY 58, LA. TECH 44 Anthony Wales rushed for 209 yards and four touchdowns, Mike White threw for 421 yards and three more scores, and Western Kentucky (10-3, 7-1) defeated Louisiana Tech (8-5, 6-2) in the Conference U.S.A. championship game in Bowling Green, Ky. Louisiana Tech won the regular-season matchup, 55-52, on Oct. 6.
