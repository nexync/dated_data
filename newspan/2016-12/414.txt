The Joffrey Ballet, which was once based in New York but moved to Chicago in 1995, will return to its hometown next spring to perform “Romeo and Juliet” at Lincoln Center. It is the first time the entire troupe will perform in New York, where it was founded by Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino in 1956, since it left the city amid financial woes 21 years ago.
The Joffrey gave the United States premiere of Mr. Pastor’s “Romeo” in 2014. The staging is a departure from the traditional Kenneth MacMillan version that New York audiences most often see at American Ballet Theater. Mr. Pastor keeps the star-crossed lovers in Italy, but places them against a backdrop of 20th-century Italian political strife.
Act 1 is set in Mussolini’s Italy of the 1930s, Act 2 takes place in a context of political terrorism in the 1950s and Act 3 unfolds during the political rise of Silvio Berlusconi in the 1990s. The Capulets are a stiff, conservative upper-class family, while the Montagues represent the liberal middle class.
Accompanying the dancers will be members of the Joffrey’s orchestra and the Chicago Philharmonic, which also performed Prokofiev’s “Romeo” score for the 2014 premiere.
