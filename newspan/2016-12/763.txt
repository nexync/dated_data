Monroeville, Harper Lee’s Alabama hometown, inspired the depiction of fictional Maycomb in Ms. Lee’s novel “To Kill a Mockingbird,” and now her former lawyer hopes to transform part of the town’s square to honor the author under a new plan.
According to the website al.com, a proposed Harper Lee Trail would include a museum to be located in a refurbished 1909 bank building, where Ms. Lee’s father kept a law office. Other plans include building replicas of homes in Ms. Lee’s novel and renovating her house on West Avenue in Monroeville.
Tonja Carter, Ms. Lee’s former lawyer, and the industrialist and philanthropist George Landegger have begun putting together preliminary plans for such a trail, according to the Alabama news site. A public, charitable foundation would fund the trail.
“In its purest form, it will be tourism for our county, and that’s a green industry,” said Monroe County Probate Judge Greg Norris, who has spoken to the principals about the plan. This summer Mr. Norris and Ms. Carter made separate visits to William Shakespeare’s birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, where they saw how much of that town and its business revolved around Shakespeare’s legacy. .
Monroeville attracts thousands of visitors annually who attend the local theater production of “To Kill a Mockingbird” and visit Ms. Lee’s exhibits at the Monroe County Heritage Museum. Judge Norris said he hopes the trail will lure more than 100,000 people a year to the town of 6,300.
“We’re going to be limited to our imagination and, as always, funds,” Mr. Norris said.
Ms. Lee died in Monroeville in February at 89.
