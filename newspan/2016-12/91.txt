HONG KONG — Wall Street money is helping fuel a potential bidding war over gambling in Australia.
A group of financial investors on Wednesday offered as much as $5.5 billion for Tatts Group, the Australian gambling operator. The investors include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the giant American private equity group.
The rival bid threatens to complicate a deal to combine two of Australia’s biggest betting companies. Tatts had agreed in October to be acquired by Tabcorp, a rival Australian betting company.
Shares of Tatts jumped more than 10 percent in Sydney on Wednesday — reaching their highest level in nearly a decade — and traded higher than the price offered by the new bidders, suggesting investors expect more bidding to come.
Tatts operates a lucrative lottery business as well as betting on horse racing and sports matches across Australia and New Zealand.
Australia is one of the biggest gambling markets globally. Revenue from gambling in all forms including lottery, poker machines and sports betting last year totaled 191 billion Australian dollars, or about $143 billion at current exchange rates, according to one comprehensive study.
In addition to K.K.R., the new bidding group includes Australian funds that manage pension and infrastructure investments and Macquarie, the big Australian bank.
In a stock exchange filing in Sydney on Wednesday, Tatts said it would compare the new offer with its planned sale to Tabcorp.
“Tatts has not yet formed a view on how the indicative proposal compares to the proposed Tabcorp merger,” the statement said. It added that the board of Tatts would evaluate the new bid, but it continued for now to recommend the deal with Tabcorp.
At the time the Tabcorp deal was announced in October, it implied a value for Tatts of 4.34 Australian dollars, or $3.32 at the time, per share. That compares with the offer of 4.40 to 5.00 Australian dollars per share that the rival bidding group submitted on Wednesday. Both offers include a mix of cash and shares, meaning their values can fluctuate.
