Laura Owens, one of the most celebrated painters of her generation and a force in the Los Angeles art world, will have her first major New York retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art opening in November, the museum announced.
The show will feature approximately 60 paintings, from the mid-1990s until recently — drawn from the museum’s own collection and many others — as well as custom-printed wallpaper and artist’s books made specifically for the show.
Ms. Owen’s work was featured prominently at the Museum of Modern Art in the 2014 exhibition “The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World,” and she has long shown with the New York gallery Gavin Brown’s Enterprise. But the Whitney show, running through February 2018, will represent her most significant presence in New York and her first major museum exhibition in the United States since an early career survey organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 2003.
