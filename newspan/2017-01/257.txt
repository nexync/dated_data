Fredrik Colting, a Swedish author who was sued by J. D. Salinger’s estate several years ago for publishing an unauthorized sequel to “The Catcher in the Rye,” has once again been sued for repurposing an iconic work by a dead writer.
This time, he is facing a legal complaint from four literary estates, representing a pantheon of influential 20th-century novelists.
The estates of Arthur C. Clarke, Jack Kerouac, Truman Capote and Ernest Hemingway, with the publishing houses Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster, have filed a copyright lawsuit against Mr. Colting and his partner, Melissa Medina, for releasing illustrated children’s books based on those authors’ works.
Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster, two of the country’s biggest publishers, joined the suit “to stand with the authors and their heirs to protect the authors’ reputations and the spirit and integrity of their novels,” the complaint said.
The lawsuit was reported earlier by The Hollywood Reporter.
In an interview with The New York Times last year, Mr. Colting and Ms. Medina said that their aim was to make classic adult novels accessible to children.
The creators of the KinderGuides series based on classic novels have been accused of copyright infringement.
Given the suit filed by the Salinger estate, some in publishing were surprised that Mr. Colting would publish children’s versions of copyrighted works. The suit, over Mr. Colting’s novel “60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye,” a sequel to “The Catcher in the Rye,” was settled in 2011. Mr. Colting was required to stop selling copies in the United States.
In an email on Thursday, Mr. Colting argued that KinderGuides were intended as educational guides, similar to SparkNotes and CliffsNotes, and as such bring added value to the works and do not violate copyright.
But the two publishers and the authors’ estates took a dim view of that reasoning.
