Brutally rejecting the people’s will, South Dakota’s Republican-controlled Legislature is rushing to repeal a vital ethics reform referendum approved by voters in November.
The 52 percent of voters who approved the anticorruption referendum were “hoodwinked by scam artists,” Gov. Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, brazenly insisted, as he promised to sign the repeal. The referendum called for the creation of an independent ethics commission to investigate abuses by statehouse politicians and lobbyists, a public financing option to reduce election spending and a $100 annual limit on lobbyists’ gifts to elected officials.
The Republican-dominated committee that approved the repeal bill did so under South Dakota’s “state of emergency” provision that would prevent voters from reversing the repeal with another referendum.
This was not only shameless but cunning. In 2014, lawmakers excluded teenagers from a voter-approved referendum to raise the state minimum wage, claiming (as they did this time) that South Dakota’s citizens did not know what they were doing. To their dismay, voters overruled them by a huge majority in a subsequent referendum in November, successfully raising the minimum wage for all workers.
Republican legislators — more eager for political revenge than mindful of the voice of the people — are now debating a bill that would double the number of signatures required to place referendums on the state ballot. Anyone wondering why South Dakota is ranked 47th in the nation for public accountability by the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity need look no further than these multiple efforts to subvert the public will.
As the rollback moved this week toward approval, Republican lawmakers sounded hollow in promising their own ethics substitute. “We are pretty squeaky clean,” a Republican state representative, Larry Rhoden, ludicrously maintained as the G.O.P. machine snuffed out the democratic process.
