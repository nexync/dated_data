Thailand’s resort island of Phuket is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Southeast Asia, with a well-earned reputation as a playground for the ultrarich.
Starting today, millionaires and billionaires will gather at the Royal Phuket Marina to party at one of the largest and most exclusive yacht shows in the world.
While the posh atmosphere has helped the island flourish in modern times, Phuket partly owes its existence to the heroic acts of two women.
In 1785 Burmese forces were at the gates of Thalang, then the largest city on Phuket. The governor had just died, and the defenders were hopelessly outnumbered. That was when Lady Chan, the governor’s widow, and her sister, Lady Mook, persuaded Thalang’s women to impersonate male soldiers and hold positions on the city’s walls.
The invaders were tricked and retreated. The brave sisters were revered as national heroes and given honorary titles from the king.
To this day, many Thais leave incense and offerings at a monument to the two, above, asking for protection before leaving the island, whether for work, an education or maybe a quick jaunt on a yacht.
