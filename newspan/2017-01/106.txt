The question came at the end of Donald Trump’s news conference yesterday, from Cecilia Vega of ABC News. He did not answer it.
The country needs a clear answer.
Top leaders of a hostile foreign government — Russia — approved an effort to influence an American presidential election. They did it by stealing emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign, and they did it with the intention of helping Trump win. Given the closeness of the outcome, he may well have lost without the help.
The biggest unanswered question now is whether the Trump campaign played any role in Russia’s effort. If it did, it committed a version of election interference that makes Watergate look meager by comparison.
Mr. President-elect, we need an answer.
