Fuentes’s namesake gallery celebrates its 10th anniversary this January, and he’s in the midst of preparing for an exhibition dedicated to those who have supported his gallery over the last decade — but haven’t necessarily been exhibited there. “I knew I wanted to do a group exhibition to commemorate the moment where I’m at,” Fuentes says. “I thought it would be interesting to feature artists who have had little to no presence in the program but are almost the invisible artists around the gallery, those that have really buttressed my program.” That group encompasses everyone from loyal opening attendees and customers to friends and friends of friends.
