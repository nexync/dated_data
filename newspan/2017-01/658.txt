The idea of using electronic devices in holistic skin care might seem counterintuitive: The rise of essential-oil-based beauty offerings and face massage seems to suggest that natural beauty is rooted in wholesome ingredients, applied topically. But among a certain set of all-natural-everything types, microcurrent facials have as much a place in a holistic beauty regimen as regular exercise and good nutrition.
Adams says the technology emits “a mild electric current” that can render products nearly three times more effective than just rubbing them on your face. (She endorses natural and nontoxic brands like Sonage and DNA.) At different frequencies, these currents can also help clear up scars, smooth wrinkles, improve elasticity and tighten skin. Next, she’ll begin offering microcurrent treatments that contour skin below the neck (on the breasts and buttocks).
When a client needs help outside of her services, to improve their lifestyle (and appearance) from the inside out, Adams often refers them to Gail Ingram NP for a blood test. “I promote eating for your blood type, and making sure that you know what your allergies are, because what is good for someone, could not be good for someone else.” She also refers clients to a variety of professionals, all women, to help cure what ails them.
