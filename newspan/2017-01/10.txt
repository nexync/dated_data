Concerns about regulatory approval have weighed on Walgreens Boots Alliance’s bid to buy a top drugstore rival, Rite Aid, as the two cut the price of the deal while pushing back the expected closing date by six months.
Shares of Rite Aid tumbled nearly 15 percent in morning trading on Monday, to $5.91.
In a joint statement on Monday, the retailers said that they would cut the price of the takeover to between $6.50 a share and $7 a share, potentially revaluing the transaction to as little as $6.8 billion. When the transaction was announced in 2015, Walgreens had agreed to pay $9 a share, or $9.4 billion.
The ultimate purchase price will be determined by how many more Rite Aid stores the combined company will sell to win antitrust approval above the 1,000 that Walgreens had previously agreed to. Under the new agreement, Walgreens said that it was willing to sell up to 1,200 stores.
Last month, Walgreens said that it planned to sell 865 stores to another drugstore operator, Fred’s.
Moreover, the companies pushed back the expected close of the deal to July 31, from last Friday. Walgreens had already postponed the merger deadline before.
This month, Bloomberg News reported that the Federal Trade Commission was dissatisfied with the companies’ plan to sell stores to Fred’s, worrying that it did not go far enough to preserve competition within the drugstore industry.
