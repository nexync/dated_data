Twitter trolls have called Jackie Evancho, 16, a “traitor” for agreeing to sing the national anthem at Donald Trump’s inauguration because her 18-year-old sister, Juliet, is transgender and Vice President-elect Mike Pence has supported anti-L.G.B.T. legislation.
Perhaps it should have been obvious that invitations to participate in Mr. Trump’s inauguration would become as polarizing as everything else around him.
The entertainment world has largely responded to Mr. Trump’s invitations with fan-pleasing rebukes. Rebecca Ferguson, the British singer, tweeted that she would perform only if she was allowed to sing the 1937 African-American anthem “Strange Fruit.” Ice-T, the rapper and actor, said that when he got the call, “I didn’t pick up and blocked the number.” George Lopez, the comedian, tweeted a Spanish insult. Elton John issued a less colorful but definitive no.
While some high-profile artists are refusing on moral grounds, there’s no professional upside to their performing, either. That may be why even pro-Trump artists like Ted Nugent, Kid Rock, Gene Simmons of Kiss, and Loretta Lynn have been refusing to say publicly whether they will perform.
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir will sing at the inauguration, as they have at six times previous inaugurations — though one member, Jan Chamberlin, resigned in protest. Participation in the inauguration is voluntary, but thousands of Mormons have signed a petition urging the choir to stay home.
But what would be an honor in any other year is this year cause for controversy.
