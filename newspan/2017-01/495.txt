Self-Care|Are You Not Washing Your Hair Enough?

Who knew hair-washing could be so … complicated?
A lot of women, warned by beauty editors and websites that shampooing too often was the culprit for their parched strands and out-of-whack scalps, have cut back on their shampoo regimen. Instead of regularly lathering up at home, a weekly routine might now go like this: a blowout at a blow-dry bar, dry shampoo, dry shampoo, dry shampoo, followed by another professional styling session, and so on.
Mr. Robin, who is based in Paris, has also noticed scalp problems at his salon, but he thinks the issue is not under-shampooing but rather that women are not cleansing properly.
“Women are in too much of a rush,” he said. “You need to rinse very thoroughly the products out of your hair.” He suggests this routine: Take 15 minutes and wash with your hair upside down (to improve circulation), then rinse very well. Add a conditioner or masque and work from the roots to the ends, but avoid leaving product on your scalp. “Then rinse, rinse, rinse like crazy,” he said.
Some women who bought into the less-is-more mantra are reconnecting with their shampoo bottles precisely because they missed the regimen.
Stefanie Koenig, a consultant in Brooklyn, used to spritz on dry shampoo frequently, but since becoming a mother, her shower time has become precious. “It’s one of the few moments I get alone, so why not make it as frequent and extended as possible?” she said.
And Kitty Bromhead, a mom who also lives in Brooklyn, started using Oribe’s dry shampoo as a timesaver for styling her bangs but also because she had read that shampooing too much would strip her hair. But now she is back to washing every other day.
