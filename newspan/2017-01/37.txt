The abominable conditions in Australia’s refugee camps highlighted by Mr. Cohen are worsened by the poverty of the islands where the incarceration is off-shored. The poverty of these places is a proximate cause as to why they agree to situate such prisons.
Some interesting reasons that underlie this poverty may be discerned by shining a little light into some dark corners.
For example, the island nation of Nauru originally went from being the richest island in the South Pacific to the poorest, by selling its actual island off as phosphate rock, damaging its environment as well. This poor country then became even poorer because it was sued by a hedge fund, as reported in The New York Times a year ago.
The question then becomes, Who would give a hedge fund hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in such schemes? The answer is the only entities with that kind of money: large government pension funds and major university endowments.
If a scheme like trying to squeeze money from a place like Nauru is able to be sold to institutional investors, that in turn speaks volumes about how difficult it is to sustain the returns needed to prevent the kind of economically systemic insolvency where we all get to be in Nauru’s shoes.
