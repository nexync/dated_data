The Oval Office is often used as shorthand for the U.S. presidency, but fewer than half of American presidents have worked there.
During President Theodore Roosevelt’s administration (1901-9), the West Wing was added to the White House to hold the executive branch’s growing staff. He had a rectangular office in the addition; it’s now called the Roosevelt Room.
Earlier leaders had worked in the residence, mostly in what is now known as the Lincoln Bedroom. Roosevelt’s successor, William H. Taft, had the Oval Office built and was its first occupant.
The design wasn’t novel.
George Washington had oval rooms in Philadelphia in 1791, allowing him to seat guests around him. It mimics an English court tradition called the levée.
There was a precursor in the White House, too. The Blue Room, used for diplomatic receptions, is rounded. And in the family quarters, there’s a Yellow Oval Room.
On Christmas Eve of 1929, the Oval Office was badly damaged in a fire. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had it renovated, moving it closer to the residence so that the “commute” is under a minute.
Presidents can redecorate, but there are limits. One is that the presidential seal must remain on the ceiling.
And there’s another tradition: The departing president leaves a letter on the desk for his successor.
