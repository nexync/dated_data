For a year and a half, Benjamin Millepied led the Paris Opera Ballet, where among other things he worked to diversify the company and to rethink the institution’s hierarchy. At one point in “Reset,” the riveting documentary by Thierry Demaizière and Alban Teurlai that chronicles Mr. Millepied choreographing a new ballet, he grabs an injured dancer’s foot and vigorously massages the heel. “Softer is pointless,” he says, ignoring her whimpers.
Mr. Millepied, the choreographer for the Darren Aronofsky film “Black Swan” (where he met his wife, Natalie Portman) and former principal at New York City Ballet, doesn’t do soft. He may be French, but in “Reset,” Mr. Millepied — brash, funny, intelligent — is very much an American living in Paris. And most of us already know the job didn’t work out in the end: Last year he announced his resignation as director of dance there.
But “Reset” also fleshes out the creative process and shows how, for Mr. Millepied, pleasure must always be part of dance. Did the film make me want to see Mr. Millepied’s ballet, “Clear, Loud, Bright, Forward,” on the stage? Yes. And that’s high praise.
