WASHINGTON — A spate of violence erupted on Friday in the nation’s capital, as protesters damaged storefronts, threw rocks and bricks at police officers and lit a limousine on fire.
Phalanxes of police officers used pepper spray, flash grenades and other nonlethal crowd-control tools to disperse the protesters. By the end of the day, six police officers had sustained minor injuries and more than 200 people had been arrested.
Many of the protesters were dressed in black, wore face masks and carried flags associated with anti-fascist groups. They congregated on a series of streets just blocks from the parade where Donald J. Trump passed as he made his way to the White House for the first time as president, their activities creating a distraction as television networks played live footage of the clashes.
The violence was focused not only on the police. Richard B. Spencer, a leader of the so-called alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and anti-immigrant positions, was punched in the face by a protester as Mr. Spencer gave an interview on the street, according to a video posted on Twitter.
“We’re not peaceful,” said one of the masked protesters who, like many others who clashed with the police, ran away after being approached by reporters.
While the clashes occurred, thousands of peaceful protesters marched across the country as they voiced anti-Trump slogans. In New York, seven people were arrested when they blocked the sidewalk outside Trump Tower.
President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration is expected to draw thousands of protesters to Washington.
Protesters in San Francisco formed a blockade across train tracks, leading to eight arrests, and chained themselves to the downtown offices of Uber and Wells Fargo. In the central business district of Portland, Ore., banks, clothing retailers and a jewelry store boarded up windows and covered walls to limit vandalism. Chants in English and Spanish broke out in front of the Capitol in Phoenix.
“This is one of the darkest days in the history of our country,” said Adelle Wallace, 75, during a rain-soaked march in Los Angeles.
The violence in Washington began about an hour before Mr. Trump was sworn in at noon. Storefront windows at a Bank of America and a Starbucks several blocks from the parade route were smashed, leading to many arrests.
Around 2 p.m., as Mr. Trump ate lunch on Capitol Hill with lawmakers and supporters, the protests expanded and turned violent. Protesters hurled rocks and bricks at police officers several blocks from the parade route. Officers with helmets and riot shields tried to disperse the protesters by using flash grenades and pepper spray.
After being pushed back a block, protesters outside the Washington Post building lit a fire in the middle of the street, smashed the windows of a limousine and then lit it on fire. The police, using more flash grenades, cleared a path for fire trucks as protesters retreated to a park.
The violence attracted a throng of onlookers, journalists and peaceful protesters who had marched earlier in the day.
Reed Arahood, 34, of Massachusetts, who had come to Washington to be part of the peaceful protests, said she was ambivalent about the violence.
“I don’t think I have words to accurately describe how I feel about them,” she said about the protesters. She added that she felt “solidarity” but also was “absolutely” concerned about the image of violent protests.
But over all the scene of thousands of protesters gave her hope.
Along several access points to view the inauguration, the protesters hoped simply to put themselves in the way, locking arms, forming human blockades in front of both public and ticketed entrances. The police directed attendees around the corners of blockades, sometimes in single file, forcing some ticketed attendees to wait nearly an hour in line to trickle past the protests.
A few attendees drummed on buckets, nodding at the instructions. Some wondered about divine intervention as the day turned rainy. “It’s the earth crying about the climate-denial president,” said Elodie Huttner, 52.
Rallies have been planned all over the country all weekend, cresting with a women’s march in Washington on Saturday.
Despite the disruptions, some in Washington were able to find moments of normalcy.
Molly Schwizer, 52, a government employee who had the day off, left the quiet neighborhood in northwestern Washington where she lives to check out the chaotic and heavily policed streets of downtown, where protesters vied with Trump supporters.
By midafternoon, she had seen enough of the protesters (“they should clean up,” she said) and the Trump supporters (no comment — she does have a government job, after all). Also, it was raining — and so it was time to shop.
