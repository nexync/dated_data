The playwright David Ives has worn many hats over the years. He has written his own plays, both short and long, including the Tony-nominated “Venus in Fur.” He was for many years the go-to guy to condense the books of the musicals presented in the City Center Encores! series. And he is currently collaborating with no less than Stephen Sondheim on a breathlessly awaited new musical adapted from two Luis Buñuel movies. What’s more, in recent years he has been channeling the classical French theater, writing verse adaptations of plays by Molière (“The School for Lies”) and Jean-François Regnard (“The Heir Apparent”).
