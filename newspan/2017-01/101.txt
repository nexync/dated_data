Inside the museum, Mr. Wille unpacked his boxes, displaying items discovered around the Pequots’ homeland: George Washington inaugural buttons, musket and cannon balls, a gold ring, commemorative spoons, a 100-year-old military insignia and the triangle of brass.
At first Dr. McBride and Mr. Naumec tried to do some metal-detecting themselves on the battlefield in 2008. “We figured it wasn’t rocket science,” he said. But they learned that while it’s not hard to find a dime lying on the floor, it takes years of practice to recognize the sound of a musket ball eight inches underground and then determine its provenance.
This is why some archaeologists “start tearing their hair out and turning red” when approached by detectorists, he said. “A lot of important archaeological sites have been damaged beyond any future scientific use by metal detectorists,” Dr. Jones said. But he complimented Dr. McBride’s work, noting that it was in the vanguard of archaeologically responsible metal detecting.
When Mr. Wille returned with his detector, he set it to find large pieces of iron, at Dr. McBride’s suggestion. Within 10 minutes the machine made a loud squeal. Mr. Wille jabbed his shovel in a circle and pulled out an eight-inch-thick plug of earth. Digging a bit more and using a vibrating pin pointer, he extracted a flat oblong piece of iron about four inches long, wider and curved at one end, flat on the other.
If it is Tatuppequauog, Mr. Wille would be listed as the discoverer. While he displayed little emotion that afternoon during the search, afterward he was ecstatic that his pasttime might contribute to history.
