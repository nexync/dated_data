More than 130 artists and critics have signed a petition calling for cultural institutions to close on Friday, Jan. 20, the day of President-elect Donald J. Trump’s inauguration.
Cultural institutions around the country are still mulling their moves, with some, including the Museum of Modern Art, MoMA PS1 and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma) pledging to maintain their regular hours that day. “Our entire program and mission, every day, is an expression of inclusion and appreciation of every culture,” Miranda Carroll, Lacma’s director of communications, wrote in an email.
The Whitney Museum will also remain open, but will implement pay-what-you-wish admission for the day, hoping to encourage discussion. “The museum will offer programming that reflects our commitment to open dialogue, civic engagement and the diversity of American art and culture,” Danielle Bias, its senior communications manager, said in a statement.
Many universities will be closed anyway on Jan. 20 — it’s winter break.
