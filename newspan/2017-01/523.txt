Fifteen years after a failed attempt, New York City is getting all of its readers on the same page. On Wednesday the city announced its One Book, One New York program, in which residents of all five boroughs will be urged to read the same book starting in early March.
In addition to speaking with officials in other cities that have pulled off the concept — including Chicago, Philadelphia and Seattle — New York officials asked an advisory panel made up of heads of public libraries, publishers, academics and others to suggest possible books. They winnowed that list down to five, and now the public will vote.
The main voting mechanism will be online. In addition, readers will be able to vote on the interactive digital kiosks now in many subway stations.
The city is launching the project in partnership with the website BuzzFeed, and five celebrity actors are taking part, each of them supporting a different book in promotional videos during the monthlong voting process. They are Larry Wilmore, Bebe Neuwirth, William H. Macy, Danielle Brooks and Giancarlo Esposito.
In addition to an event planned in June at the main branch of the New York Public Library, at which the chosen book’s author will appear, there will be discussions and other associated programming in all five boroughs.
Ms. Menin said the publishers whose books are on the ballot will donate a total of 4,000 copies of the finalists to more than 200 library branches.
