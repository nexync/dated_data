The Park Service resumed posting messages to its Twitter account by midmorning on Saturday, apologizing for the “mistaken” retweets.
The messages in question, which the Park Service deleted, included one from Binyamin Appelbaum, a reporter for The New York Times, that showed side-by-side aerial photos of the National Mall during Mr. Obama’s first inauguration and Mr. Trump’s on Friday.
Based on similar photos, a crowd-size expert made an initial estimate that Mr. Trump’s inauguration drew a crowd on the Mall about one-third the size of the one at Mr. Obama’s event. Mr. Trump had predicted an “unbelievable, perhaps record-setting turnout” for his inauguration.
At an appearance on Saturday at the C.I.A. Headquarters, Mr. Trump spoke about the crowd at his inaugural ceremony and said the news media had created a misleading impression.
The Park Service account also retweeted a comment about the White House website, which was changed after Mr. Trump was sworn in to include the new administration’s goals and priorities. In the process, it eliminated the Obama administration’s sections on climate change and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues.
The Park Service stopped releasing crowd estimates for gatherings on the Mall after it estimated that 400,000 people had joined the Million Man March in 1995, which drew accusations of racism and threats of a lawsuit from the Nation of Islam, which thought the figure was too low.
Congress subsequently passed a bill barring the service from conducting counts of crowd sizes. The agency did not release a number after Mr. Obama’s first inauguration, but said it believed it was the “biggest crowd ever” to pack into the area.
