If you are reading this in China, congratulations. Not many people are.
That is because Chinese authorities instructed Apple late last month to remove The New York Times news app from the Apple app store. As Katie Benner and Sui-Lee Wee report, the move follows China’s 2012 blocking of The Times’s website. In 2012, the shutdown appeared to be the result of a series of reports in The Times on the extensive wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then China’s prime minister.
It is not clear why the app was removed. Apple would not even say what regulatory violation, if any, caused the removal; who in the Chinese government told Apple to do it; or whether any legal case had been made, or legal documents presented, before Apple acceded to China’s wishes.
The removal happened on Dec. 23. Earlier that day, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with Apple executives in conjunction with an article that would be published on Dec. 29 on the billions of dollars in perks and subsidies that China provides to the world’s largest iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, a manufacturing partner of Apple’s.
The move underlines the difficulty news organizations face in reporting on China, particularly when the country’s own people are also the readers.
Apple, which values China as both a manufacturing center and a consumer market, has in the past removed other news apps. Those of other major publishers remain available on the app store in China.
It is unclear whether Apple has ever resisted a Chinese order to remove an app, or otherwise broken with a request from the government.
Last year, Apple had an extended dispute with the United States government about helping to unlock an iPhone of a terrorist who had committed murders. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said the company would comply with any court order, but this became unnecessary when the United States employed hackers to open the iPhone.
