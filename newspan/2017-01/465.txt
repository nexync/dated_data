California’s new ban on using hand-held devices while driving takes only a baby step in the right direction. For a first infraction, the base fine is $20, less than a parking ticket in many towns. And the new law doesn’t prohibit such uses of digital devices as watching videos on dashboard-mounted smartphones. What message does that send about society’s attitude toward distracted driving?
In contrast, drunken driving is treated as a serious criminal offense, and carries a strong social stigma. Until we reach the point where the use of digital devices while driving is as unacceptable as drunken driving, new laws will not be tough enough, or taken seriously.
The national campaign to promote the use of designated drivers, conducted by the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and the television industry starting in the late 1980s, helped change social norms around drinking and driving. A similar campaign to promote the social unacceptability of driving while distracted might yield similar success.
The writer, an associate dean at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, created the designated driver campaign.
