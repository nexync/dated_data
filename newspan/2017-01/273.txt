Miranda Priestly is getting ready to sing.
The pop star Elton John and the playwright Paul Rudnick have signed on to write a musical adaptation of “The Devil Wears Prada,” the producer Kevin McCollum said Thursday.
The collaboration is a significant step for the project, which Mr. McCollum has been working on for two years. Mr. John has extensive Broadway experience, including as the composer for “The Lion King,” and he won a Tony Award in 2000 for writing the score for “Aida.” Mr. Rudnick has won praise as a comedic playwright (“The Most Fabulous Story Ever Told”), screenwriter and essayist.
The musical will be adapted from the 2003 novel by Lauren Weisberger and the 2006 film, from 20th Century Fox, that starred Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. The story is about the hellish tenure of a young woman working as the personal assistant to Ms. Priestly, the imperious editor of a fashion magazine.
The musical will be co-produced by Mr. McCollum (“Rent,” “Avenue Q,” “Something Rotten!”), Fox Stage Productions (the theatrical division of 20th Century Fox Film) and Rocket Entertainment (a company run by David Furnish, Mr. John’s husband). The producers did not announce a timeline for the project, but said it was being developed for Broadway.
