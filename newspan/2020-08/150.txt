Argentina secures a deal to restructure $65 billion in debt.
Under the agreement, creditors will be paid 54.8 cents on the dollar, according to an Argentine government official who has taken part in the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private negotiations.
Argentina would offer creditors new bonds in exchange for defaulted debt and unpaid interest. Investors who hold euro-denominated and Swiss franc-denominated bonds would also be able to swap these for new U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. The agreement also includes changes to payment dates.
The country has also been in talks with the I.M.F., after restoring ties to the institution with a 2018 bailout. The fund said Argentina’s debt pile was unsustainable as its currency plummeted and economic output kept falling. Martín Guzmán, Argentina’s economy minister, had told local media that he would look to the I.M.F. for an alternative way out of its debt crisis if the talks with private creditors failed.
