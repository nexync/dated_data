Tanzania hasn’t reported a single coronavirus case in three months, even as the African continent is expected this week to cross the threshold of one million reported cases.
In May, the head of Tanzania’s national laboratory was dismissed after Mr. Magufuli questioned the efficacy of testing kits supplied by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mr. Magufuli claimed that the kits had returned positive results on samples secretly taken from a goat and a pawpaw fruit. The Africa C.D.C. and the W.H.O. both rebutted those allegations, saying the tests were reliable.
With limited reporting, critics have accused the government of a cover-up, especially after videos of night burials with attendants wearing protective gear surfaced online.
