While many fossils have been flattened by time and the elements, a titanosaur found in an egg was preserved in three dimensions.
Some 20 years ago, someone smuggled dinosaur eggs from Argentina to the United States illegally. The smuggler probably had little clue that inside one of the eggs was one of the best-preserved skulls of a dinosaur embryo ever found, which is now giving us new insights into the facial appearance of one line of our planet’s erstwhile rulers.
“Just to have that sort of level of detail and preserved in 3-D was just astonishing to me,” he said.
Dr. Kundrát first saw the skull in 2011, and began making detailed 3-D scans of it. The scans let Dr. Kundrát and his team see the skull as a whole without damaging it, and it opened their eyes to something unusual about the embryo’s eyes: The sockets angle toward the front of the skull. This is different from older sauropods, where the eyes face to the sides.
Forward-facing eyes can give animals better depth perception, as with human eyes, Dr. D’Emic said. It’s possible that this feature somehow helped the animals survive after they hatched — especially because there’s no evidence titanosaur parents cared for their hatchlings. But why younger sauropods and not older sauropods needed to be good at gauging the distances between things isn’t at all clear.
Dr. Kundrát said he suspected that the hatchlings might have the horn for defense against predators, or to help them find food. But nothing is known about what titanosaurs ate, or what their interactions with predators were like, so, like the front-facing eyes, the horn’s exact function will remain a topic for future study.
Today, the skull sits in Los Angeles, in the hands of one of the new study’s authors, Luis Chiappe, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. But as soon as the coronavirus pandemic eases, Dr. Kundrát and his team plan to repatriate the skull back to Argentina.
