“It took us some time to analyze it and quantify it robustly, but it turned out to be another record melt year,” Dr. Sasgen said. In the previous record year, 2012, the net loss was about 460 billion metric tons.
That would take centuries. But since the 1990s, as the Arctic has warmed faster than any other part of the planet, ice loss from Greenland and its contribution to sea level rise have accelerated. At the current rate of loss, Greenland’s ice accounts for about one-quarter inch per decade of the global total increase of about one and a quarter inches per decade.
But ice loss can vary from year to year. In their paper, Dr. Sasgen and his colleagues found that net loss in 2017 and 2018 was about half the annual average since 2003.
Both 2017 and 2018 had colder-than-usual summers, Dr. Sasgen said, when cold air flowed from the north along the west coast of Greenland, reducing ice loss. But in 2019 that circulation pattern was reversed, with warm air coming from the south.
Similar reversals have happened before. “It was really fascinating that it jumped again from very cold historic conditions to a record melt year,” he said.
“Mass loss is not going away anytime soon,” Dr. King said. “But of course we have control over the rate" by taking steps to mitigate climate change.
