Interspersing found footage with original interviews, Ja’Tovia Gary makes poetic video works that elucidate the realities of racial injustice — and how the country might change.
“That’s good,” Gary says in response. “I hope you never ever feel like you are in danger, that you always feel safe and strong.” Gary’s interview with Beecher is one of many that she conducts with Black women and girls in Harlem that day, asking those passers-by — who differ in age, ethnicity and spiritual identification — if they feel safe in their bodies, and in the world. She includes their wide-ranging responses to her question in “The Giverny Document” (2019), an experimental film that explores what it means to exist in the world for Black women, and Black women only. The roughly 40-minute feature was part of a three-channel video installation presented at both Paula Cooper Gallery in New York and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles this year (both shows closed early because of Covid-19), but has also been shown as a stand-alone project at film festivals, garnering Gary awards and critical acclaim.
The power of her films comes in part from her intimate and involved process. Gary spends hours scouring the internet for archival footage — from live performances to interviews — and treats the material as a canvas, scratching or painting onto the film surface or even adhering flower petals to clear film strips before digitizing and editing them. In the case of the Facebook Live footage she uses in “The Giverny Document,” Gary obscures Castile’s bloodied body with leaves and petals she plucked from the plants in Monet’s garden to interrogate the ease with which society consumes images of Black death and violence.
