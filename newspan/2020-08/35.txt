Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is said to have sternly discussed payouts and red lines in a telephone call with Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister.
Mr. Trump said last week that he did not mention American intelligence assessments of the bounties program when he spoke this month with Mr. Putin. “That was a phone call to discuss other things, and, frankly, that’s an issue that many people said was fake news,” he said in an interview with “Axios on HBO,” even though the C.I.A. had placed medium confidence in the assessment.
“They’ve been giving me the Russia hoax — Shifty Schiff, all these characters — from the day I got here,” he said, using his nickname for Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.
The bounties operation is overseen by a Russian military intelligence unit, U.S. officials said. An obvious channel the Americans could use to address the issue is an important one between the top military officers in both nations, said Andrew S. Weiss, a former American official and Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But it is not known if the current officers, Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian general staff, have spoken of the bounties via that channel.
Robert C. O’Brien, the White House national security adviser, echoed Mr. Biegun in an op-ed article published last Sunday by The Washington Post that listed the Trump administration’s attempts to counter various activities by Russia.
