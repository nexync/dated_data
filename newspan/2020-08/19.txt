The first two webinars in our back-to-school series are all about using The Learning Network to help you bring the world to your students, for free.
We’ll be hosting dozens of professional development webinars for teachers during this school year on ways to teach and learn with The New York Times and The Learning Network — all for free. We know we’ll all need to be supporting one another through what promises to be a challenging year of teaching and learning amid a pandemic.
The Learning Network publishes about 1,000 teaching resources each school year, all based on using Times content — articles, essays, images, videos, graphics and podcasts — as teaching tools across subject areas. Whether you are a teacher or a parent, this webinar will help you get started in using these free resources.
Register here to view the Aug. 27 on-demand webinar.
Register here for the Sept. 10 webinar at 4 p.m. Eastern time.
Teachers across the globe use our resources to connect students to the world, give students a voice, strengthen literacy skills and promote critical and creative thinking through multimedia.
In this webinar, we will show you what The Learning Network is all about; teach you how to use our popular student activities; walk you through account creation and commenting; and share resources for online learning.
