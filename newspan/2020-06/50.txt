Daniel Karslake’s documentary follows four families navigating issues of faith in relation to the sexual orientations and gender identities of their children.
On June 26, 2015, hundreds of people gathered in front of the Supreme Court in anticipation of its decision to legalize same-sex marriage. It was a watershed moment that, in the words of former President Barack Obama, marked “a big step in our march toward equality.” But it was just the beginning. “For They Know Not What They Do,” a compelling documentary by Daniel Karslake, outlines the uneven path toward progress for L.G.B.T.Q. people in the United States by following four families navigating issues of faith in relation to the sexual orientations and gender identities of their children.
The families include Rob and Linda Robertson, evangelical parents who are encouraged to send their 12-year-old son Ryan to conversion therapy after he comes out; David and Sally McBride, the Presbyterian parents of Sarah McBride, the transgender activist (who is now running for Delaware State Senate); Victor Baez and Annette Febo, the Catholic parents of Vico, a survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting; and Harold and Coleen Porcher, the parents of Elliot, a nonbinary teen struggling with depression after coming out.
“For They Know Not What They Do” hits the touchstones of a good documentary — absorbing testimonies, compelling narratives and effective commentary that highlight the violence faced by L.G.B.T.Q. people (especially transgender people of color). But its success comes from interrogating the cultural assumption that there is no space for a range of sexual orientations and gender identities within religious communities. Because for most of these families, faith is a tool for understanding, not exclusion.
