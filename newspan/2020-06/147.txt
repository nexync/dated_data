“We’re a mess,” the late-night host said at an online event meant to replace the annual celebrity-studded showcase hyping the Disney-owned networks ABC, ESPN and FX.
From a Lincoln Center stage, Jimmy Kimmel looked out at nearly 3,000 empty seats that, in any other year, would have been filled for the Walt Disney Company’s annual presentation to advertisers.
“I forgot to delete this from my iCal,” he said on video presented to the media giant’s advertising clients.
With theaters closed in New York, media companies have resorted to less elaborate presentations to keep advertisers interested. Following events by NBCUniversal and ViacomCBS and other companies, Disney put on what it called a “virtual roadshow” made up of seven presentations, shown to ad agencies over the past two weeks, filled with sizzle reels backed by triumphant music.
Executives hyped upcoming shows from various Disney channels: an FX drama starring Jeff Bridges and Matthew McConaughey, a detective thriller on ABC from David E. Kelley, an ESPN documentary about Tom Brady. There were appearances by Alex Rodriguez, Gordon Ramsay, David Muir, Robin Roberts and Bear Grylls.
In a presentation shown to reporters, Jeff Meacham, an actor from ABC’s “black-ish,” had a conversation with a Barbie doll. Ryan Seacrest, who hosts “American Idol,” called Disney a “reach machine” for its popularity with multiple generations. Kerry Washington, who stars in “Little Fires Everywhere” on Hulu, talked up product placement opportunities.
