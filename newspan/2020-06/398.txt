I can’t blame them. Maintaining forward movement on two wheels so as not to fall over is one of life’s great joys. It’s a way to stay healthy and to rediscover your community. Maybe it’s nostalgic, or aspirational. It’s a good way to get around when some of the alternatives don’t feel so great.
The good news is that nearly any bike that fits you and rolls will do. This is the most important thing to keep in mind, in the context of shortages: A bike is a bike. Ever seen a bike-share bike, such as a Citi Bike in New York or a Divvy bike in Chicago? They’re heavy, clumsy and come in one size. But they work well enough for most riders with no more than a seat adjustment.
The risk of theft depends on where you live and what kind of bike you’re leaving outside, as well as what kind of lock you buy. (There is no such thing as a theft-proof lock, but some are certainly better than others.) Plenty of people leave affordable bikes out in New York City, for example, because the risk is worth the convenience and cost. More than theft, usually, the issue with storing a bike outside is that it will age it fast. Parts will corrode, lubricant will wash off, bearings and cables will degrade faster than usual. Your maintenance schedule will be doubled at least. Depending on your living situation, though, this could be as much a case for a very cheap used bike as it is for keeping your bike inside.
