Cauleen Smith’s experimental films about black life, Kyle Marshall’s dance improvisation dedicated to victims of police brutality: Here are some of the Instagram accounts brightening our art critic’s daily feed.
Social media, as flawed as it is, can be a valuable tool. But I wanted to return to aesthetics and consider the many visual manifestations of “Black Lives Matter”: pictures of the protests, yes, but also photographs of black life unrelated to police (or other) brutality, and, just as important, the visionary creations of black artists. Images alone can’t bring about change, but they can jump-start our imaginations and help us see more clearly. Here are a few accounts doing that.
It’s fitting that I found out about RVA Magazine’s Instagram account because of a photograph. The picture, taken by a man who goes by Jiggy the Creative, shows protesters in front of the Robert E. Lee monument in Richmond, Va. A large sign in the crowd proclaims “Black Lives Matter” in handwriting that mirrors graffiti on the base of the memorial, while a light projection casts George Floyd’s face onto the Confederate landmark. The image encapsulates the historical shift we’re living through: The day it was posted, the governor of Virginia announced plans to remove the statue (although a judge has temporarily halted the process). As protests against police brutality have swept the country, RVA Magazine has done a terrific job of showing what’s happening on the ground in a city that’s out of the national media spotlight by steadily sharing powerful work by professional and local amateur photographers.
