WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday let stand an appeals court ruling allowing the Trump administration to resume executions in federal death penalty cases after a 17-year hiatus. The court’s order cleared the way for the executions of four men in the coming months.
In a statement at the time, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, said that the “the government has shown that it is very likely to prevail” when the case moved forward.
In April, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated Judge Chutkan’s ruling, though the two judges in the majority, both appointed by President Trump, offered conflicting rationales for doing so.
Judge Gregory G. Katsas concluded that the 1994 law “regulates only the top-line choice among execution methods such as hanging, electrocution or lethal injection.” Judge Neomi Rao disagreed, saying the law also requires the federal government to follow execution procedures in state statutes and regulations — but not in less formal execution protocols.
The two judges agreed, however, that the executions could proceed.
In the administration’s Supreme Court brief in the case, Bourgeois v. Barr, No. 19- 1348, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco urged the court to let the executions go forward, saying the prisoners had been convicted more than 15 years ago of brutal murders of children.
Requiring the federal government to use the three-drug cocktail required in some state protocols would be odd, Mr. Francisco wrote. The combination of chemicals has been blamed for botched executions and has given rise to lawsuits from death row inmates who said it could subject them to excruciating pain.
Mr. Barr recently announced new execution dates for the four prisoners, starting with Daniel Lewis Lee on July 13. Mr. Lee was convicted of murdering a family of three, including an 8-year-old girl.
