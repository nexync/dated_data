Issues include limited access to community support and counseling and, in some cases, quarantining with unsupportive family members.
Some organizations are now expanding online L.G.B.T.Q. programs, including offering virtual summer camps, online summer Pride events, a virtual prom, weekly summer virtual youth groups, online support groups and online art and cultural events.
L.G.B.T.Q. youth and caregivers who need support can contact the Trevor Projectâ€™s 24-hour hotline, The Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender National Hotline, Family Equality Council and PFLAG.
