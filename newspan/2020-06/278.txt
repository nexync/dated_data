The Russian leader described an America poisoned by racism and violence and paralyzed by the refusal of President Trump’s opponents to accept the 2016 election results.
MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Sunday described the United States as a country gripped by a “deep internal crisis” and attributed it to what he said was a refusal by opponents of President Trump to accept his “obvious” 2016 election victory and his legitimacy as leader.
Speaking in his first interview since the coronavirus pandemic hit Russia hard three months ago and forced him to take shelter at his country residence, Mr. Putin also pointed to the racial tensions that have put cities across the United States on edge.
While insisting that he wanted to be “very careful” in his comments on events in the United States, Mr. Putin has often been accused of trying to sow American division, and appeared to be using the interview to do so again, taking a swipe at America’s handling of the coronavirus under Mr. Trump.
Mr. Putin, too, has come under pointed criticism over his response to the pandemic.
With his approval ratings at their lowest level since he came to power 20 years ago, he has been eager to declare victory over the coronavirus so that health concerns don’t again disrupt nationwide military parades, now scheduled for June 24, and a referendum, postponed until July 1, on constitutional changes that would allow him to stay in office until 2036.
