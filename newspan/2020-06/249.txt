Lessons from Camden, N.J.
Those words seemed to evoke recent demonstrations for racial justice following the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade and others at the hands of the police. The protests have often been accompanied by demands to remove Confederate statues and other monuments that demonstrators see as symbols of white supremacy.
The Houston Chronicle reported on the post on Friday.
In an emailed statement on Monday, Ms. Williford, who held a managerial position as the trial bureau chief for the District Attorney’s Office in Harris County, which includes Houston, confirmed that she had shared the post, but said she had not intended to make a comparison to Black Lives Matter protests.
Mauro Beltramini, a criminal defense lawyer in Houston, helped bring the post to the attention of the public. He saw it on Friday, he said, when a friend in the District Attorney’s Office shared it with him.
He added that as a person of Jewish ancestry, he was troubled by the comparison between demonstrators for racial equality in the United States and the oppression of Jewish people in Nazi Germany.
On Friday afternoon, he shared a screenshot of the post on his own Facebook page. “Here’s a screenshot of the H.C.D.A.O.’s Trial Bureau Chief being racist,” he wrote, referring to the Harris County District Attorney’s Office and adding an expletive. The attention snowballed from there, and a Change.org petition calling for Ms. Williford’s resignation was signed by more than 100 people over the weekend.
She also pointed to past cases in which she had worked to avoid a wrongful prosecution or to secure a pardon for defendants of color. “I have spent my career defending the rights not only of victims, but those wrongfully accused,” she said.
