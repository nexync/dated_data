The shooting happened early Sunday morning in the city’s Uptown neighborhood, near the site of protests over the death of George Floyd.
MINNEAPOLIS — One person was killed and 11 wounded in a shooting in Minneapolis early on Sunday morning, the police said.
All of the victims were adults and those who were wounded did not have life-threatening injuries, the police said. Though a motive for the shooting was unclear, the episode involved people shooting at one another, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.
The wounded were taken to hospitals with injuries “at various severity levels,” the police said on Twitter. The person who was killed was a man who died at a hospital, John Elder, a spokesman for the Police Department, said in a statement.
The suspects fled and no one has been taken into custody, the police said.
A video posted to Facebook Live of the aftermath showed people tending to the wounded in front of Hoban Korean BBQ on Hennepin Avenue, a bustling block of bars and restaurants in the city’s Uptown neighborhood.
Fred Hwang, the restaurant’s manager, said shots were fired at people lined up outside the restaurant. There were so many shots, “no one can count,” Mr. Hwang said.
The police said they received calls at 12:37 a.m. with reports of multiple people shot.
People crowded into the restaurant for safety, but shots were soon fired into the restaurant, Mr. Hwang said. He said he found three different types of shells after the shooting.
The shooting happened near the site of protests over the death of George Floyd in the custody of the Minneapolis police. People had been shooting fireworks from their cars in the streets outside the restaurant, Mr. Hwang said, adding that Hennepin Avenue had been closed to traffic and turned into an impromptu block party this weekend.
