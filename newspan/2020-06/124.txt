Saying the existing Police Department cannot be reformed, a majority of the City Council has promised to rethink public safety from the ground up in the wake of George Floyd’s killing.
MINNEAPOLIS — Nine members of the Minneapolis City Council — a veto-proof majority — pledged on Sunday to dismantle the Police Department, promising to create a new system of public safety in a city where law enforcement has long been accused of racism.
Saying that the city’s policing system could not be reformed, the council members stood before hundreds of people gathered late in the day on a grassy hill and promised to begin the process of taking apart the Police Department as it now exists.
For activists who have been pushing for years for drastic changes to policing, the move represented a turning point that they hope will lead to a transformation of public safety in the city.
The pledge in Minneapolis, where George Floyd died 13 days ago after being pinned to the ground by a white police officer’s knee, reflected calls across America to rethink what policing looks like. Protesters have taken to the streets with demands to shrink or abolish police departments, and “defund the police” has become a frequent rallying cry.
Officials in other cities, including New York, have begun to talk of diverting some money and responsibilities from police forces to social services agencies, but no other major city has gone as far in reaction to the protests as the Minneapolis officials have promised to do.
Protesters across the country are calling for the abolition of policing. But what would that actually look like?
Today, several major U.S. cities are now proposing ways to defund and even dismantle their police departments. John Eligon on the thinking behind those plans and what they might look like in practice.
It’s Tuesday, June 9.
(CHANTING) I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!
(CHANTING) No justice, no peace! No justice, no peace!
— it was just pure emotions and raw rage.
[EXPLETIVE] these racist [EXPLETIVE] police!
And from there, you start hearing these calls at protest, at rallies.
(CHANTING) Defund the police! Defund the police!
You start hearing calls to abolish the police. You start seeing people waving signs. And it became clear that this was an opening that a lot of activists saw to take this moment of a very brutal police killing and turn it into something much larger.
Do the right thing!
So John, what do these concepts — defund, dismantle, abolish the police — what exactly do they mean?
To defund, when activists say that, what they mean is taking money away from the police department’s budget and redirect it toward other things — whether that be social services, agencies, maybe mental health agencies — that can do functions that police are often called on to do.
And where did these concepts come from?
Well, at their core, they come from the problems and issues that especially communities of color, especially black communities, have had with policing. They see police coming into their communities to brutalize them, not to protect and serve them. And that has really influenced this desire to keep the police away, to do something else. And we’ve seen, basically, that governments and police forces, they respond with certain reforms. We’ve seen efforts for body cameras. We’ve seen diversifying the police departments. We’ve seen changes to the rules on use of force.
But what became clear to a lot of today’s activists, and what they say explicitly, is that these reforms are not working. If you look at since Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri six years ago, the police have continued to kill people at high rates, and especially black people at disproportionately high rates. And so for them, the only solution is to tear it down and build something new.
So John, what might it actually look like in practice to defund or abolish a police department?
So for instance, if someone is homeless and they’re struggling on the streets, a person can call 9-1-1, and instead of an armed police officer being sent out, perhaps there can be an outreach worker from a homeless services agency. Or if you have someone having a mental health episode, then again, you can call 9-1-1, and instead of a police officer, maybe a health care worker, a mental health worker will come out. And the idea behind it is to really cut down the interactions between armed police officers and civilians. And by doing that, the hope is that it will reduce their conflict and the potential for people getting hurt or killed by police officers.
Right. I mean, that makes a certain sense, especially for a community where there’s not a lot of violent crime. But every community is different, right? And some towns, some cities — I think about New York City, for example — have a significantly higher rate of violent crime that would seem to require having armed police. So how do activists think about that?
For a lot of the activists that I spoke to, the issue was about centering public safety on communities. And one activist that I spoke to, Arianna Nason, she said essentially it’s going to be up to each community to decide what public safety looks like for itself.
It’s going to be up to every community to decide what they need. We can’t decide that.
So maybe that’s armed patrols. Maybe that’s mental health workers. Maybe that’s some sort of mobile units with social workers sitting in it, and people are trained in using force and different things. One of the big ideas is this idea of community policing, community watch. And it’s interesting. I had said isn’t an issue, though, with community policing or community patrols, neighborhood watch, that if I walk into that community, as a black man with dreadlocks, if I walk into one of these communities, we see what happens with neighborhood watch. We see Trayvon Martin. We see Ahmaud Arbery.
Should that be a concern, then? I guess with this community-type based model that certain people who look a certain way might go into the neighborhood, and that community might decide to take it into their own hands and then take it overboard, I guess.
Honestly, I don’t really know the answer to that right now.
She was not sure exactly what the answer was. And see, this is all to say, it’s still very tricky and very much a work in progress. But what she did say is that the current system also is not working for me either. So it’s a matter of what are they going to do differently? And they believe that something drastically different needs to be done.
Mm-hmm. As best you can tell, would any of the familiar elements of an existing police department — I’m thinking, for the sake of argument, homicide detectives, special victims units that investigate sexual assault or rape — do those remain? Do they take a different form? Do they adopt a different name? Has that been fleshed out?
I would say, no, it’s not been fleshed out. Because again, we go back to the fact that this is not going to be some federal commission, or even state commission or a city commission for anywhere that’s going to come up with, like, these are the rules for public safety now. And these are all things that need to be worked out. And I think what people say with things like homicide investigations, with sex crimes investigations and things like that, they say a couple of things. One, the police are not doing a good job at those anyways. So you have lots of cities where the clearance rate on homicides and other investigations is miserable.  So they had a lot of issues with crimes that were not being investigated properly. And then, the second thing that people say is that those jobs can be taken up by specialized, trained people. You can build new institutions to do those things that aren’t necessary policing. I did talk to one council member who said, maybe there’s still police, but for very, very limited role, and many of their responsibilities are farmed out. You know, anything short of some sort of active violence, you don’t need police for. So in some people’s eyes, that would still be a police force. But one thing that the people who are most ardent about abolishing the police or defunding the police, even, they make it clear that they don’t just want a system in which it’s police in another name, police with another uniform on.
And these demands to defund the police, they’ve actually been brewing in Minneapolis for several years now. Ever since a police killing back in 2015, there’s been several local activist groups working on it. And those activist groups came together this past weekend in what was probably the biggest and most clearest demand for defunding the police.
(CHANTING) Abolish the M.P.D.!
So there were hundreds of activists who went and gathered in front of the mayor Jacob Frey’s house.
Abolish the M.P.D.! And they had a megaphone. They were chanting. They were screaming. And sure enough, the mayor came out to talk to the protesters. He kind of made his way through the crowd, walked up to the front, and you had one of the lead organizers for a group called the Black Visions Collective. Kandace Montgomery, she was standing up on a riser there, talking down in a megaphone to the mayor.
Jacob Frey, we have a yes-or-no question for you. Yes or no, will you commit to defunding Minneapolis Police Department?
And you could tell, like, there is this hesitation because he knows this is not going to go well, right? You have all these very vocal, very ardent activists around you who want you to defund the police.
Will you defund the Minneapolis Police Department?
All right, be quiet y’all. Be quiet, because it’s important that we actually hear this. It’s important that we hear this, because if y’all don’t know, he’s up for re-election next year.
I do not support the full abolition of the police department.
You’re wasting our time! Get the [EXPLETIVE] out of here!
And he gives his answer — he does not support full abolition of the police.
 
And he turns around, and he just kind of walked off into the sea of people.
(CHANTING) Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!
So after this event, there was already an event planned for the following day by some of these same activists organizations, in which they were going to bring council members who were supportive of their cause onto a stage in a park in the Southern part of the city. And they were going to try to get them to make a commitment to defunding the police.
So a lot like what they had done to the mayor?
Hi, Minneapolis. You look so beautiful today. I’m Lisa Bender. I’m the president of the Minneapolis City Council.
And so we had this gathering where there were hundreds of residents.
Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.
And you had council members.
And you had nine of them who went up on the stage.
And then all nine of them each read a part pledging to defend the police.
The last council member, he basically said, and we are all committing to this pledge. And at that moment, it was like this emotional eruption.
You had white people, black people, Asian people, all putting their fists in the air, shouting, defund the police, defund police.
(CHANTING) Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.! Defund M.P.D.!
So just to be clear, this is not a vote, and not necessarily even a pledge to vote, but this is a public commitment to defund the police — to do the very thing that the mayor, when asked, declined to agree to 24 hours before.
Yes, exactly. This is a pledge that they are going to defund the police. It is not a vote. It is not anything set in stone or written. But these are putting them all on record in front of many community members, saying that we are going to do this. And I even asked the activists about that. I said, we’ve heard politicians say things before and not keep those pledges. But this is something that they saw they’ve been working on with them together in tandem. So I think there’s a level of trust there that this pledge has really meant something. And you could see it in the reaction of the people who were there. They were really describing it as their Civil Rights Movement, their Voting Rights Act moment.
Wow. And John, can the members of the City Council who were in that park, making this pledge, do they have the actual authority to take away funding from the police department?
Yes, they absolutely have voting authority to do that. The council actually controls the police department’s budget. And what’s more significant about this moment is that because there were nine of them, those nine seats represents a veto-proof majority. So even if the mayor, Jacob Frey, does not want this to happen, if that coalition sticks together, they can do this on their own. And I think what we’re seeing is this sentiment is growing in traction in certain places. Like we already have in New York and Los Angeles, the mayors in both of those cities have already said that they are going to be redirecting funds that were intended for the police toward other parts of the city, toward other agencies in the city.
I’m curious what the appetite for this kind of change to policing is, beyond the cities where there are largely Democratic city councils and mayors, and where this is now under discussion.
That’s a very key question, right? We’re already seeing conservatives coming out against this and talking about this is as very radical leftist step to be taking. We see Donald Trump already tweeting about it. So certainly, this is something that, for conservative communities, something like this would be a tougher sell. And so again, policing is a very local thing. So what you experience and what the police force does or does not look like in Minneapolis is going to be very different than what it does or does not look like in Edina, which is just outside of Minneapolis, or any other suburb. So it’s going to be, in some ways, a patchwork of public safety, I think, if these things start happening around the country.
And I guess an open question is whether or not this has entered the mainstream, even of the Democratic Party. Just a few hours before you and I began to talk, Joe Biden came out and said he does not support defunding the police.
Yeah, this is certainly not something that is part of the mainstream or moderate Democratic platform. That said, you do get some people who might be in these more moderate spaces, you do get their attention and you do get their ear, is this sense that policing is not working — which is just the basis of what these defund or abolish the police efforts are about, is that the system is not working. And so you will get even the more moderate folks to say that, to buy into that. And that may not result in them supporting a defund or abolishment, but will it support more stringent reforms, more significant reforms to police? So we’ll see what happens.
I wonder how the activists that you’re talking to see the challenge of explaining what these concepts are going to mean. Because in this moment, I think many Americans are really hearing these calls — defund, dismantle, abolish — for the first time. And they may be very wary of them, and they may see them as quite radical.
What the activists will tell you is that while it might sound radical for many Americans, this actually is not all that radical for a large section of this country.
What was your name, sir?
If you go to black and brown communities — like I went up to the North Side of Minneapolis — and you talk to people about their experiences with the police there, it is not the experience of expecting an officer to come and help you. It’s exactly the opposite. And I was speaking with a couple there, Amanda and Yaazirah Brazelton.
A change, yeah.
Yeah. About time for a change.
And they were telling me that from a young age, essentially, they already had horrific experiences with the police.
[INAUDIBLE] I have police put guns in my face, you know, at seven years old, coming to my house with my mother and my father arguing, just regular argument that happens with a husband and wife.
Yaazirah, he was seven years old when the police came to his house when his parents were having an argument.
And they put guns in my face and put us all on the ground.

They traumatized me in childhood, so I was really against white police officers since.
And his wife Amanda, she was 14 when she was in a car with white people, and she’s black.
And when they were pulled over, the cops let the white people out, but then they pulled guns on her.
I’m 14 years old, in the backseat of the car, not doing nothing wrong. And that was my first real incident with the police in that interaction.
And so the way they see the police department is not a force where you call and then an Officer Friendly shows up.
Man, I got a houseful of kids that are scared of the police because of what they’ve seen.
It’s one where Amanda recalled her children have already had run-ins with the police that when someone was breaking into their house once, she didn’t call the police, but she called family and friends.
And I called him. I called my brother. I called my uncle. I called my dad, my mom, before called the police.
 They’ll call me, I’ll get killed in my own home.
So it’s already a lived experience, a lived reality for people in many black communities, that the police are essentially a force that only exists, in their eyes, to harass them, to brutalize them and not to protect them. And what the activists hope is that people who are scared that abolishing police will suddenly lead to a breakdown in their communities and just rampant violence, they’re saying, no, this will create outcomes that will make the community safer and better, not just for affluent white communities, but for all communities across the country. And so what activists are asking is that people who see this as a radical idea, who can’t envision a world without police, they’re asking them to just walk in these people’s shoes, understand what they’re going through.
The nine members of the city council that came from every corner of our city to stand together to make this commitment, we don’t have all the answers.
In an interview on Monday, the president of the Minneapolis City Council, one of the nine members who has pledged to defund the city’s police department, acknowledged that implementing the plan would likely take years.
Good morning, everyone. The Justice in Policing Act establishes a bold, transformative vision of policing in America.
On Monday, Congressional Democrats introduced the most sweeping federal plan to reform the police in modern memory.
Never again should the world be subjected to witnessing what we saw on the streets in Minneapolis — the slow murder of an individual by a uniformed police officer.
The legislation would reduce the legal protections that now shield police officers accused of misconduct from being prosecuted, and would impose new restrictions to prevent police officers from using deadly force. The measure is expected to quickly pass in the House, where there’s a Democratic majority, but faces an uncertain future in the Republican-controlled Senate. Meanwhile, state-level reforms continue. On Monday, New York’s legislature banned the use of chokeholds by police and repealed a statute that effectively hid the disciplinary records of police officers.
Almost 7 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to W.H.O., and almost 400,000 deaths. Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally, it’s worsening.
The World Health Organization said that the number of new daily infections from the coronavirus hit a record high — more than 136,000 on Sunday — and warned that mass protests in places like the U.S. could further spread the virus.
We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. 
Finally, the National Bureau of Economic Research said that because of the pandemic, the United States economy officially entered a recession in February, ending the longest economic expansion on record. It began in 2009 and lasted 128 months.
That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. My colleague Caitlin Dickerson will host the show tomorrow.
Council members said in interviews on Sunday that they did not yet have specific plans to announce for what a new public safety system for the city would look like. They promised to develop plans by working with the community, and said they would draw on past studies, consent decrees and reforms to policing across the nation and the world.
Protesters who gathered at the windswept rally, with a view of Powderhorn Lake, said what mattered most was that elected officials had finally committed to a sweeping overhaul of policing, even though they had not offered specifics of how a dismantling would work.
“I knew it was happening, but I didn’t believe it,” she said.
Councilwoman Alondra Cano, who leads the Council’s public safety committee, said that scene made her think about the need to create space for discussions — a truth and reconciliation commission of sorts — to develop solutions to the city’s policing issues.
The City Council voted on Friday to accept a civil rights investigation of the police by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights and to amend the Police Department’s use-of-force policy to ban chokeholds, among other measures.
Protesters’ cries to defund or abolish the police are often not meant literally. Rather, they are demands to rethink a law enforcement system from the ground up and to grapple with deeply ingrained issues, including employing officers who do not live in the city they police — as is done in Minneapolis — and sending armed officers to respond to situations that turn out not to be crimes, as when a mentally ill person is in distress.
Some proposals have focused on ending heavy-handed police tactics like no-knock search warrants and military-style raids on the homes of suspects, restricting the flow of military gear to police departments and banning the use of military equipment on protesters.
A common thread has been the tendency of police departments to consume ever larger shares of city budgets.
“We’re really saying we want to grow our community, and we want to invest in the things we actually need,” said Ms. Montgomery, who led the protest on Saturday and grilled Mr. Frey on his views, leading to the chants that prompted him to leave the scene.
Council members and activists pointed to examples of different styles of policing in places like Austin, Texas, where the operators who answer 911 calls inquire whether a caller needs police, fire or mental health services before dispatching a response, and in Eugene, Ore., where a medic and a crisis worker with mental health training are dispatched to emergency calls.
Many have called for relying more on self-policing by the community, in the way attendees often do at events like music festivals, with the police stepping in only when a true emergency arises. Some cited as an example how, in the days after the killing of Mr. Floyd, teams made up of dozens of members of the American Indian Movement patrolled streets and directed traffic in the Little Earth housing community in Minneapolis.
Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter and chair of Reform L.A. Jails, said the move by the Minneapolis City Council members had shifted the movement to rethink policing from the fringe to the mainstream.
Many advocates note that city budgets are already strained by the coronavirus pandemic, which shut down business and tourism, sharply reducing tax revenue, and that police budgets may be especially vulnerable.
The city of Minneapolis is looking to cut $200 million from its $1.3 billion overall budget, according to Lisa Bender, the president of the City Council. She said she hoped to reallocate some money from policing, which received $189 million in the 2020 budget, to other areas of need in the city.
Lt. Bob Kroll, the president of the Minneapolis Police Union, did not respond to requests for comment.
Activists have been calling for change in the Minneapolis Police Department for a long time. Outrage over police killings prompted many of the current City Council members to run for office.
Ms. Levy-Armstrong said she was worried about completely abolishing the Police Department, fearing that city leaders would make decisions without sufficient input from minority communities.
After the accusations of police brutality through the years, the failed past attempts at reform and then the horrific footage of Mr. Floyd’s killing — as well as the police response to protests that has included rubber bullets and tear gas — major changes to policing in Minneapolis are now inevitable, said Kenza Hadj-Moussa, a spokeswoman for TakeAction Minnesota, an advocacy group.
