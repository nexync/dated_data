Richard Haass talks about his new primer on global affairs, and Abhrajyoti Chakraborty discusses translated novels.
The ambition of Richard Haass’s new book is clear from its title: “The World: A Brief Introduction.” In just 400 pages, Haass, who has been the president of the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations since 2003, offers a primer on world affairs. On this week’s podcast, Haass talks about why he wrote it.
Abhrajyoti Chakraborty visits the podcast to discuss his recent review of four novels in translation, including Yu Miri’s “Tokyo Ueno Station,” translated by Morgan Giles. The novel is narrated by Kazu, a dead man who spent his final years in a camp of homeless people in Tokyo’s Ueno Park and haunts the area after his death.
Also on this week’s episode, Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Tina Jordan and John Williams talk about what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
