Crosswords & Games|What the Heck Is That?
As if by magic, the word MAGE erased itself from solvers’ heads in the Saturday, June 27, puzzle by Ryan McCarty. It was the most “revealed” entry among online and app solvers in last week’s crosswords.
A MAGE is “a person who has magic powers or who has studied for a long time and has a lot of knowledge,” according to Cambridge English dictionary. Synonyms for this entry include, but are not limited to, sage, magician, witch, warlock, conjurer, wizard, sorcerer and shaman.
The plural of MAGE is magi, as in the three wisemen who visited the baby Jesus. MAGE is also a character that can be played in video games such as Dungeons & Dragons and World of Warcraft.
Clues using wordplay are in bold.
