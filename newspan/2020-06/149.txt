The streaming giant will permanently shift a share of its cash to financial institutions that serve Black communities, allowing them to lend more.
The project took on greater urgency the next month after the killing of George Floyd while in custody of Minneapolis police officers, which set off weeks of nationwide protests against systemic racism and police brutality.
Mr. Mitchell said he had drawn on the book “The Color of Money: Black Banks and the Racial Wealth Gap,” by Mehrsa Baradaran, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. Professor Baradaran argues that Black-focused lenders are undercapitalized, depriving these communities of economic opportunities.
“You need capital to build more capital,” she said in an interview.
Hope Credit Union, which is based in Jackson, Miss., reported just over $300 million in assets at the end of last year. The money from Netflix will have “a tremendous impact” in Black communities, Hope’s chief executive, Bill Bynum, said in an interview.
“Pound for pound, no entity has a bigger impact” than a community lender, he said, pointing to a greater ability to lend to small businesses and aspiring homeowners.
Lack of capital at banks serving rural and minority communities is a concern among regulators as well: The Federal Reserve’s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, deplored “financial deserts” in America at a forum hosted last year by Hope.
