11 Asian-American artists celebrate their experiences of culture and identity with illustrated self portraits.
Since the coronavirus arrived this spring in the United States, there has been an uptick in acts of violence and prejudice toward Asian-Americans. For many, these incidents represent a compounded bigotry: they are wrongly blamed for the virus, and they are lumped together as a single group.
The term “Asian-American” masks profound national and cultural differences in the name of representation.We asked 11 illustrators of Asian descent to create a self-portrait, reflecting on their heritage, their stories of immigration, and how they identify as an Asian-American.
The self-portrait is a complex form of representation. Through facial expression, posture, brushstroke and color, the artist attempts to explore the perception of culture and self. These portraits convey how the artists see themselves and are an interpretation of how they believe they are perceived by others.
