SAN FRANCISCO — Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, faced fresh criticism on Wednesday as nearly three dozen people who worked at the social network in its early years called out his decision to leave President Trump’s aggressive posts on the site unaltered.
Mr. Zuckerberg has been under fire since Twitter added labels to several of Mr. Trump’s tweets last week for the first time to indicate they were inaccurate or glorified violence. On Wednesday, Snap, which makes the Snapchat app, said it would stop promoting Mr. Trump’s Snapchat account after determining that his public comments off the site could incite violence.
Facebook has taken no action on posts in which Mr. Trump made inaccurate statements about mail-in ballots in the November election or his aggressive messages about protesters after the death of George Floyd, an African-American man killed in police custody in Minneapolis.
Mr. Zuckerberg has since faced strong internal pushback for the inaction. The dissent has spilled out across internal message boards, with some Facebook employees resigning in protest, while others staged a virtual “walkout” this week and refused to work. On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg defended his position, saying Mr. Trump’s posts did not violate Facebook’s policies and reiterated that he supported free speech.
