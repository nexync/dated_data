WASHINGTON â€” Pregnant women exposed to high temperatures or air pollution are more likely to have children who are premature, underweight or stillborn, and African-American mothers and babies are harmed at a much higher rate than the population at large, according to sweeping new research examining more than 32 million births in the United States.
The particular vulnerability of black mothers to heat and air pollution was likely the result of several systemic problems, the authors said.
African Americans are more likely to live close to power plants and other sources of air pollution, Dr. Basu said. They may also be less likely to have air conditioning in their homes or less able to afford the higher electrical bills, she said, or to live in neighborhoods with green spaces that can help keep temperatures down.
