The poet Claudia Rankine writes for the Book Review about the climate in America at this moment.
This week, the Book Review asked two prominent American poets to write original poems responding to this historic moment in our country. Claudia Rankine, whose poem “Weather” appears here and on the front cover of the June 21 issue, is the author of “Citizen: An American Lyric” and other collections, as well as two plays and various essays. She teaches at Yale. Her new book, “Just Us: An American Conversation,” will be published in September. Jericho Brown’s third volume of poetry, “The Tradition,” won the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for poetry. His poem “Say Thank You Say I’m Sorry” appears on the back page of the issue.
