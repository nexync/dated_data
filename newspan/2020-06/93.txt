When you think about it, there’s something weird about the way we treat “history” as a category unto itself, since it essentially amounts to “everything that ever happened before today.” The Code of Hammurabi is history; so is the Victorian view of the mind-body connection; and so is the rise of the internet — but hats off to the person who can speak knowledgeably about all three.
We can’t help you with that, sorry. But we can offer three wide-ranging histories to read this week: Doug J. Swanson’s “Cult of Glory,” which presents a revisionist view of the Texas Rangers; Eric Cervini’s “The Deviant’s War,” which shines a light on the pre-Stonewall battle for gay rights; and Nancy Thorndike Greenspan’s “Atomic Spy,” which revisits the tale of the notorious Soviet mole Karl Fuchs.
Also up: three novels (by J. M. Coetzee, Hervé Guibert and Sanaë Lemoine), a couple of books by cartoonists, a survey of global politics and an ode to swimming as a way of life.
