Until 1997, all of the spacecraft sent to the surface of Mars had been stationary landers. But in 1997, the Pathfinder mission included something that was revolutionary for NASA: a wheeled robot. That rover, Sojourner, was roughly the size of a short filing cabinet. That success was followed by two golf cart-size rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, arriving on Mars in 2004 and then Curiosity, about the size of a car, in 2012.
Ms. Aung said that the technology could be adapted to a bigger craft, up to about 30 pounds in weight instead of four. That might be large enough to carry a couple of pounds of cameras and other instruments.
