Assessing the pandemic’s impact, a Federal Reserve report sees strains on businesses and households and a fragile road back to steady growth and employment.
The Fed noted that employers had cut about 20 million employees from payrolls since February, reversing a decade of job gains. While the unemployment rate eased to 13.3 percent in May after jumping to 14.7 percent in April, the Fed called that rate “still very elevated” and said workers in low-wage jobs, who are disproportionately from minority groups, had been hit especially hard.
“In the months ahead, labor market prospects for the unemployed and underemployed — both over all and for particularly hard-hit groups of workers — will largely depend on the course of the Covid-19 outbreak itself and on actions taken to halt its spread,” the report said.
It also suggested that the pandemic was probably costing workers more than their employment: Those still in the labor market are seeing weak pay growth.
