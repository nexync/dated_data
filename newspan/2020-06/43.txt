In an influential book, he defied the idea that being gay, as he was, is an illness, and took on psychiatry’s “history of homophobia.” He died of the coronavirus.
Kenneth Lewes grew up after World War II in a working-class neighborhood of the northeast Bronx, the son of an immigrant couple who never got beyond grade school. 
But it wasn’t until he was nearly 50 — and publishing what would become a critically acclaimed takedown of post-Freudian psychoanalytic theories of homosexuality — that he confided his sexual orientation to his parents.
Dr. Lewes (pronounced LOO-ess) was married at 23 and divorced by 32 — the age when he had his first homosexual experience.
Dr. Lewes died of the new coronavirus on April 17 in a Manhattan hospital, his partner, Gary Jacobson, said. He was 76.
He is also survived by his sister, Noreen Vasady-Kovacs.
He said he had been unable to find a single analysis of the subject written by a psychoanalyst who identified as gay.
Kenneth Allen Lewes was born on June 8, 1943, in Charleston, W.Va., to Joseph and Anne (Harvin) Lewes. His father was an English-born furniture maker and antique restorer for the National Trust for Historic Preservation; his mother, born in Czechoslovakia, was a homemaker.
The family moved to New York in 1947. There, intending to become a mathematician, Kenneth enrolled in the Bronx High School of Science, graduating in 1960. He then shifted gears, earning a bachelor’s degree in English from Cornell University in 1964 and a doctorate in Renaissance English literature from Harvard.
At the age of 36, after seven years as a professor of Renaissance literature at Rutgers University in New Jersey — and without ever having taken a psychology course — he made another transition and enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he earned a second doctorate, this time in clinical psychology, in 1982.
His study of English proved surprisingly serviceable, though.
