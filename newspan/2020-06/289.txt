The departures came in response to an open letter signed by more than 1,800 people criticizing the organization’s remarks and calling on it to dedicate more funding to antiracism efforts.
Almost immediately, the statement drew criticism and ridicule on social media. In the letter, the poets called it “worse than the bare minimum” and an insult to George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African-Americans whose deaths in encounters with police prompted the protests.
The letter called for “an official, public response” within a week. On Saturday, the foundation issued a statement by Bunn, the board chairman, pledging to “honor that timing” and offer a detailed plan of action.
The letter to the Poetry Foundation stands out both because of its direct riposte and the extent of the demands, which range from the specific (diversification of the foundation’s staff, more support for poets from marginalized groups) to the sweeping.
“Ultimately, we dream of a world in which the massive wealth hoarding that underlies the foundation’s work would be replaced by the redistribution of every cent to those whose labor amassed those funds,” the letter declares.
Today, the foundation has a staff of more than three dozen, and annual expenditures of more than $4 million on prizes, fellowships and public programs like the Chicago Poetry Block Party. The block party, founded with Ewing and Nate Marshall (another poet who spearheaded the letter) in partnership with the foundation, is an annual event held in neighborhoods well beyond the city’s wealthy enclaves. In separate Twitter posts, both Ewing and Marshall said they would no longer participate.
An earlier version of this article misstated Willard Bunn III’s title at the Poetry Foundation. He is its board chairman, not its president.
