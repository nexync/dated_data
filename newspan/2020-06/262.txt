His research into dopamine led to the mainstay treatment still used today to treat millions of people with Parkinson’s.
Oleh Hornykiewicz, a pharmacologist whose breakthrough research on Parkinson’s disease has spared millions of patients the tremors and other physical impairments it can cause, died on May 26 in Vienna. He was 93.
His death was confirmed by his longtime colleague, Prof. Stephen J. Kish of the University of Toronto, where Professor Hornykiewicz (pronounced hoar-nee-KEE-eh-vitch) taught from 1967 until his retirement in 1992.
His findings spurred the establishment of human brain tissue banks, research into dopamine, and treatments of other diseases caused by low levels of neurotransmitters.
He was named a full professor of pharmacology and psychiatry at the University of Toronto in 1973 and, in 1976, appointed to head the newly founded Institute of Biochemical Pharmacology of the University of Vienna. He held both posts concurrently.
He is survived by his daughter, Maria Hentosz; three sons, Nikolaj, Stephan and Joseph; six grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. His wife, Christina (Prus-Jablonowski) Hornykiewicz, died before him.
