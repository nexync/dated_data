A 24-year-old real estate investor won the Republican nomination on Tuesday to fill a western North Carolina congressional seat vacated by Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, unexpectedly defeating the former congressman’s handpicked successor who had been endorsed by President Trump.
Madison Cawthorn was on track on Tuesday night to defeat Lynda Bennett with nearly two-thirds of the vote, according to The Associated Press. The surprise victory — and the overwhelming margin — was remarkable given Ms. Bennett’s two-to-one fund-raising advantage and the vocal support of Mr. Meadows and Mr. Trump for her candidacy.
Mr. Cawthorn will turn 25 before November’s elections, making him just old enough to be eligible to be a member of the House. If he wins, he would be the youngest lawmaker in the modern history of Congress and one of the youngest ever elected. The precise ages of several members of the House and Senate serving around the nation’s founding are unknown.
In a statement after his victory, Mr. Cawthorn made a direct appeal to Mr. Trump and his supporters who backed Ms. Bennett.
Democrats have nominated Morris Davis, an Air Force veteran who goes by Moe and who was the chief prosecutor at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The district, which encompasses the state’s far-western counties in the Smoky Mountains, is considered safe Republican territory, even after North Carolina was forced to redraw its congressional map for this fall’s elections.
North Carolina Republicans moved quickly to rally around Mr. Cawthorn on Tuesday night. Michael Whatley, the chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, said he was “completely confident” that Mr. Cawthorn would win in November.
“He will be a great fighter for Smoky Mountain families, and always put America first,” Mr. Whatley said.
