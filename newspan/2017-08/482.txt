Mr. O’Connell’s grandly titled documentary — advertised “for adults only” when it opened in New York in 1968 — has been digitally restored for showings at Anthology Film Archives on Saturday and Sunday. It is a prize artifact. While images of hippies and be-ins may be overfamiliar, an 87-minute immersion in countercultural exuberance can still be disorienting. In its blithe sense of social breakdown, “Revolution” would make an excellent double bill with George Romero’s “Night of the Living Dead” — the yin to the yang of the period’s most evocative American movie.
Many of Mr. O’Connell’s interviews were gathered in Golden Gate Park. A couple in velvet cloaks and face paint declare themselves the King and Queen of Summer. A nun calls herself just another “hippie girl,” while a member of a guerrilla theater group boasts, “We struggle in our own humble way to destroy the United States.” Optimism is a virus. One founder of the Morning Star commune declares that in the future “leisure will be compulsory.” If only.
Ms. Malone did not go on to stardom (her only other screen appearance was a cameo in Mr. O’Connell’s 1996 reissue of “Revolution). One participant did.
“Revolution” was not Mr. O’Connell’s only exploration of a counterculture. “The Greenwich Village Story,” originally released in 1963, grimly explores the consequences of love among a glum set of New York bohemians. It’s also showing at Anthology on Friday and Sunday.
