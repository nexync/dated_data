With the New York International Fringe Festival, normally the biggest fish in the pond, on hiatus for 2017, a number of opportunists have leapt forward with new summertime options for New York City theatergoers. Among these go-getters are the folks behind the inaugural Corkscrew Theater Festival, running Monday, Aug. 7, through Sunday, Sept. 3.
Corkscrew, which aims to support early-career artists, includes five world premiere productions and a handful of readings. Given that they’re all new works by lesser-known writers, it’s hard to tell what to expect, but the festival seems to cover many themes in imaginative ways. One play, Robert Zander Norman’s “All of My Blood,” is about a young woman who struggles to express herself to her boyfriend and family — and who may be turning into a werewolf. Hmm … O.K., I’ll bite.
All performances are at the Paradise Factory in Manhattan; corkscrewfestival.org.
