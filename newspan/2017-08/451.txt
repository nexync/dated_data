“Wonder Woman” charges onto streaming platforms. And you can spice up your week with a global array of erotic thrillers.
THE HANDMAIDEN (2016) on iTunes and Amazon. A devious maid, Sookee (Kim Tae-ri), worms her way into the employment of a beautiful young heiress, Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), held hostage in a mansion by her uncle (Cho Jin-woong), an erotic-book collector who intends to marry her for her fortune. But a con man (Ha Jung-woo) masquerading as a count has a plan of his own — a scheme that seems doomed when things between the women turn steamy. The director, Park Chan-wook, spun this voluptuous fantasy from Sarah Waters’s lesbian romance “Fingersmith,” and transplanted it to 1930s Korea during the Japanese occupation. “A rebus, a romance, a gothic thriller and a woozy comedy, ‘The Handmaiden’ is finally and most significantly a liberation story,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times.
SPIN on Walter Presents. If “House of Cards” and “Borgen” collided in Paris: That’s the tone of this French political thriller, in which two campaign consultants, Simon Kapita (Bruno Wolkowitch) and Ludovic Desmeuze (Grégory Fitoussi), are pitted against each other when their respective employers decide to claw their way into the Élysée Palace. Catch up on the first two seasons before the third starts streaming on Sept. 7.
