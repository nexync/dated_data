What’s more pleasurable on a vacation to Italy than enjoying a scoop or two of gelato? There may only be one answer, and that’s savoring the gelato you made yourself. Luckily, travelers can now try their hand at the craft by taking one of the several gelato-making classes for amateurs offered throughout Italy. These classes are usually between two and four hours long, held either at cooking schools or gelato shops and are a family-friendly activity. Here are five options.
In Turin, IC Bellagio offers a two-hour private class at a popular gelateria in the city center. The head gelataio — the name for the person who makes the frozen treat — teaches the session in the shop’s kitchen and begins with an explanation of how gelato differs from ice cream. After tasting more than 20 kinds of gelato including coffee and licorice, guests use the shop’s machine to make their favorite flavor. An English-speaking assistant is on-hand to help with language translation. 580 euros, about $685, for two people.
