Two women injured during the right-wing extremist protest last weekend in Charlottesville, Va., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday seeking damages from the rally’s organizer and more than two dozen leaders, groups and websites affiliated with the self-proclaimed alt-right.
The suit was filed with the Circuit Court in Charlottesville by Tadrint Washington and her sister Micah Washington, who said they were physically and emotionally injured when a man the police have identified as James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Ohio, plowed his Dodge Challenger into a throng of people who were protesting the “Unite the Right” rally on Saturday. Heather D. Heyer, 32, was killed, and several others were injured.
The 28 defendants named in the suit included Mr. Fields and what amounts to virtually the far right’s entire top leadership, including Jason Kessler, the rally’s organizer; David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan; Richard B. Spencer, a prominent white nationalist; Matthew Heimbach, a founder of the Nationalist Front; and Austin Gillespie, who is also known as Augustus Sol Invictus and who earlier that day had announced that he was seeking Florida’s Republican nomination for the Senate.
They were taken to the University of Virginia Medical Center, where they were treated. Mr. Fields was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and malicious wounding.
None of the far-right leaders could be reached immediately for comment on the suit.
