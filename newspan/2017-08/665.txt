Awful though it was, some good came of a German air raid on London in July 1917. Twenty-two Gotha bombers had flown in for the attack, but only 19 returned, Prime Minister David Lloyd George told a secret session of the House of Commons a few days later. The incursion had not been made with impunity, he said.
The downing of the bombers allowed an artist working for The Times Mid-Week Pictorial to render the airplanes’ general structure and arrangements in a cutaway diagram, including the racks and chutes in which 14 60-pound bombs were carried over the target, and the bombardier’s sighting window on the underside of the fuselage. The diagram also showed the biplane’s 260-horsepower Mercedes engines, manufactured by Daimler Motors.
The Mid-Week Pictorial of a century ago also printed a photo of Maj. Gen. John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force in Europe, touring a munitions plant in Paris. He looked quite satisfied with the array of deadly shells, stacked waist-high. If the right side of the picture spoke to the cold machinery of modern war, however, the left side contained an almost domestic tableau out of the 19th century.
