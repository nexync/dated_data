Jamar Roberts, a dancer with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, will take the leap from performer to choreographer next season with the premiere of “Members Don’t Get Weary,” his first piece for the company.
Ailey announced on Wednesday that the work would debut as part of the troupe’s annual season at City Center, which is scheduled for Nov. 29 through Dec. 31 and includes one other premiere and three new productions of repertory dances.
Mr. Roberts won a Bessie Award (the dance world’s equivalent of the Tonys or Oscars) for outstanding performer last year. “Members Don’t Get Weary,” he said in a statement, is “a response to the current social landscape in America” and “takes an abstract look into the notion of one ‘having the blues.’” The work, set to music by John Coltrane, will have its premiere on Dec. 8.
On Dec. 1, the Ailey dancers will perform another new work, “Victoria,” by the Spanish choreographer Gustavo Ramírez Sansano, who has created works for Nederlands Dans Theater, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago and the Atlanta Ballet. “Victoria,” set to the composer David Gordon’s adaptation of Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony, will be his debut with Ailey.
Other new productions include Twyla Tharp’s 1983 work “The Golden Section,” set to music by David Byrne; Jawole Willa Jo Zollar’s “Shelter” (1988), which returns to the Ailey repertory after 25 years; and Talley Beatty’s “Stack Up” (1983), in celebration of the centennial of that choreographer’s birth next year.
No Ailey season is complete without Alvin Ailey’s masterpiece, “Revelations.” There will be 25 opportunities to see it at City Center — though only four performances, from Nov. 29 through Dec. 2, will feature a live choir.
