No fancy tests are needed to map the pop-cultural DNA of “The Good Karma Hospital,” a British dramedy whose six-episode first season arrives Monday on AcornTV.
“Good Karma” plays a small variation on these formulas by making its hero, Dr. Ruby Walker (Amrita Acharia), Anglo-Indian rather than white. After a bad breakup, she flees Britain for a struggling hospital in southern India — she’s both going somewhere exotic and coming home. She speaks the language (with an accent) but can still be surprised by the local dilemmas, such as the question of whether to let a female baby with a heart defect die.
There is no clash of cultures that can’t be mitigated through pure sentimentality. If “Good Karma Hospital” is your kind of drug, you’ll want to mainline it. The coastal locations (filmed in Sri Lanka) are picturesque, the Bollywoodish music is catchy and the performers, including Amanda Redman of “New Tricks” as the hospital’s overseer, are ingratiating.
As a bonus, two much-loved actors show up as the parents at a destination wedding and stick around for the season. The father is Philip Jackson, Inspector Japp in “Agatha Christie’s Poirot,” and the mother is Phyllis Logan, in her first role since Mrs. Hughes in “Downton Abbey.” The hospital may be in India, but if you look past the palm trees you could just as well be in the English countryside.
