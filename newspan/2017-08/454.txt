This week’s cover features a conversation between John le Carré and Ben Macintyre, two authors who share far more than their interest in British espionage. This is not the first time le Carré’s voice has appeared in the Book Review. Forty years ago he sat down with Michael Barber for “John le Carré: An Interrogation,” in which he proved himself not just a master of spy fiction but a sharp analyst who effortlessly delivers prophetic commentary.
Michael Barber I think Eric Ambler once said that there is a criminal and a policeman in all of us, and that this could account for the popularity of spy fiction and allied genres. Would you agree?
John le Carré I think there’s something much more fundamental at work at the moment. We have learned in recent years to translate almost all of political life in terms of conspiracy. And the spy novel, as never before, really, has come into its own. There is so much cynicism about the orthodox forms of government as they are offered to the public that we believe almost nothing at its face value. Now, somehow or other the politicians try to convey to us that this suspicion is misplaced. But we know better than that. And until we have a better relationship between private performance and the public truth, as was demonstrated with Watergate, we as the public are absolutely right to remain suspicious, contemptuous even, of the secrecy and the misinformation which is the digest of our news. So I think that the spy novel encapsulates this public wariness. And I think also, in entertainment terms, it makes a kind of fable about forces that we do believe in the West are stacked against us.
