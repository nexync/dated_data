WASHINGTON — President Trump’s longtime aide Hope Hicks will serve as the interim White House director of communications and will help the president find a permanent person for the job, the administration said Wednesday.
However temporary it is, it was the latest reshuffling in the White House and comes at a time when the president’s remarks on white supremacists were drawing fire from Democrats and Republicans. The role of communications director is to set a clear and direct message coming from the White House each day.
Ms. Hicks, 28, already is considered one of the most important people in the president’s communications orbit and has the most sway over who in the news media gets interviews with the president. Her current title is director of strategic communications.
Ms. Hicks was a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump during his presidential campaign and at the Trump Organization.
Ms. Hicks is close to the president, and also close with Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka.
Ms. Hicks, who grew up in Greenwich, Conn., will temporarily fill the vacancy left by Anthony Scaramucci. Unlike Mr. Scaramucci, who kept a high profile during his 10 days in the position, Ms. Hicks has long been a hidden hand, staying behind the scenes and outlasting other administration staff members.
She knows Mr. Trump’s rhythms, and he views her as one of the few people around him truly looking out for his interests, not tending her own image.
Ms. Hicks is also keenly aware that Mr. Trump is, ultimately, his own communications director.
For his part, Mr. Scaramucci expressed his support for Ms. Hicks on Twitter.
