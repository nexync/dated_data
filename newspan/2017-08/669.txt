Conan O’Brien and Trevor Noah said President Trump refused to listen to his staff on what seemed like a very small matter on Monday: whether to look directly at the solar eclipse.
Mr. Noah asked Roy Wood Jr., a correspondent on “The Daily Show,” to share his take on the recent protests by white nationalists and other far-right groups against the removal of Confederate monuments.
“The Klan marching doesn’t shock me. What would shock me is if they marched in the hood. Take that [expletive] to Oakland and see what happens.” — ROY WOOD JR.
Andy Richter was about to use his eclipse glasses — then he decided to let someone else look first.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will appear on “The Daily Show” on Tuesday.
