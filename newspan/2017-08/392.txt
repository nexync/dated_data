Is the Next Great New York Crime Movie Set in Flushing?
To make the new drama “Good Time,” a New York crime movie that harks back to the gritty streets of “The French Connection” and “After Hours,” the filmmaking brothers Josh and Benny Safdie looked to less obvious neighborhoods.
They shot the movie, which stars Robert Pattinson and Benny Safdie as small-time bank robbers, in all five boroughs as well as Westchester and Suffolk counties. “We actually wanted to call the movie ‘Rego Park’ at one point,” Josh said, referring to the Queens neighborhood just west of the brothers’ native Forest Hills.
The brothers — the bearded Josh, 33, and the clean-cut Benny, 31 — took me on a tour of locations they used, a trip that felt a bit like being in a Safdie film myself, down to visiting a bail bondsman who was actually in the movie.
American Liberty Bail Bonds, Kew Gardens, Queens A cluster of bail-bond agencies sits outside the Queens County Criminal Courts, though only American Liberty Bail Bonds now has walls adorned with photos from a movie shoot. Eric J. Paykert, a bail bondsman who played one in the movie, was there the day we visited. (He runs the agency with his wife, Astrid Corrales, who is also in the film.) He hadn’t seen “Good Time” yet, but he told Benny, “I already bought my ticket.” He was also excited about a television interview that Mr. Pattinson had chosen to do there.
