TUESDAY PUZZLE — We have a geography lesson from Timothy Polin today, along with facts about each of the seven cities in his grid.
Mr. Polin’s grid makes use of mirror symmetry, most likely to aid in getting all of those cities in the grid and still being able to fill it decently.
Each city has its state abbreviation inside it, so 3D’S TUSCALOOSA contains AL, or the abbreviation for Alabama, where TUSCALOOSA is. See if you can find the other six cities and states.
The only speed bump I hit was at 7D’s ASTORIA. As a New Yorker (I know, I know), my point of reference for ASTORIA is in the New York City borough of Queens, but this one is in ORegon. I was also a bit confused by the circled first letter A, because I thought at first that it was part of the abbreviations at 7D. It’s meant to be part of the abbreviation at 5A.
■ 15A: I personally find it hard to remember the difference between ROSIN and resin, but luckily, the crossings led me to ROSIN. It turns out that the ROSIN used on the bows of musical instruments is a solid form of liquid resin.  It refers to a powerful wind that blows, or a GALE.
■ 12D: Whenever you see clues with references to places or houses that are “cool,” you are typically being asked to think of an IGLOO.
