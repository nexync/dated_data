— Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, when asked about the feud between President Trump and her husband, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell.
They were a dissatisfied group of Americans, determined to break away.
Not Californians in 2017. Or Texans for … decades. But on this day in 1784, settlers in western North Carolina declared an independent state. They were concerned that the local and national governments, which were in a debate over debts related to the Revolutionary War, did not have their best interests at heart.
The State of Franklin, in what is now eastern Tennessee, adopted a constitution with power divided among three branches, like the national government that its leaders hoped one day to join.
The state made treaties, levied taxes and set salaries, but not in currency. Instead, those salaries included 1,000 deer skins a year for the governor, 500 raccoon skins for the governor’s secretary and a single mink skin for the constable for each warrant signed, according to one account published in The Times in 1852.
Officials sought the help of Benjamin Franklin, but hopes of national recognition were never realized. The state only lasted a few years because of internal dissent and external pressure.
But it had an impact. The State of Franklin was eventually absorbed into Tennessee, and its leader, John Sevier, became Tennessee’s first governor when it joined the union in 1796.
