Mr. Romney’s remarks, posted on Facebook on Friday, mark some of the strongest language from a Republican against Mr. Trump after a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville and an attack by a driver that left a woman dead. Mr. Trump, on Tuesday, said “both sides” were to blame for Saturday’s deadly violence.
Mr. Trump is scheduled to have a rally in Phoenix next week, raising concern about more possible violence. The mayor of Phoenix, Greg Stanton, said in a Twitter post on Wednesday that he was “disappointed” that the president would hold a political event “as our nation is still healing from the tragic events in Charlottesville.” Mr. Stanton, a Democrat, urged Mr. Trump to delay the visit.
In his message to the president, Mr. Romney also noted that United States military leaders had distanced themselves from the president.
Mr. Romney called for the president to apologize.
Mr. Romney was a leading contender to be Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, before the president chose Rex W. Tillerson. He has generally been muted in the controversies of the Trump administration.
But he was among the loudest of Mr. Trump’s critics during the campaign: At one point, he derided Mr. Trump as a “phony, a fraud” and warned of damage to the Republican party if he became the nominee. Mr. Romney also said during the campaign that he had concerns about Mr. Trump’s comments appealing to racists.
On Friday, Mr. Romney closed his Facebook statement saying now was a “defining moment” for Mr. Trump.
Other Republicans have lashed out against Mr. Trump for his remarks, as well.
On Tuesday, Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and presidential hopeful in 2016, said white nationalists in Charlottesville were entirely at fault for the deadly violence in Charlottesville.
