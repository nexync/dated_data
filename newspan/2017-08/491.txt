Asked by the host, Chris Wallace, about a United Nations statement condemning the president’s words, Mr. Tillerson said that “I don’t believe anyone doubts the American people’s values” or the government’s commitment to them.
Mr. Wallace then inquired about Mr. Trump’s own values. After Mr. Tillerson’s pointed response, Mr. Wallace asked whether he was separating himself from the president on the issue.
 During a wild news conference at Trump Tower three days later, Mr. Trump blamed “both sides” for the deadly violence.
In the weeks since Ms. Heyer’s death, Mr. Trump has alternated between singling out neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan for condemnation and asserting that what he called the “alt-left” was also to blame for the Charlottesville violence.
A group of United Nations experts, without naming Mr. Trump, criticized a “failure at the highest political level of the United States of America to unequivocally reject and condemn” racist violence.
The strongest criticism of Mr. Trump inside the administration has come from Gary D. Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, who was so upset by the remarks that he drafted a resignation letter. Mr. Cohn, who is Jewish, told The Financial Times in an interview last week that the Trump administration “can and must do better” to condemn hate groups.
