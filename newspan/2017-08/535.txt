“Freed From ISIS, Not the Torment” (front page, July 27) describes a girl’s horrific experiences at the hands of ISIS, part of its effort to eliminate the Yazidi systematically.
This detailed account of these grave crimes against the Yazidi ethnic minority in Iraq makes it even more egregious that the international community continues to fail to take action against this genocide.
ISIS not only determined that the Yazidi were “eligible” for enslavement, but also that the enslavement and subsequent campaign of sexual violence and torture against Yazidi women and girls are central to its efforts to eliminate and achieve destruction of the Yazidi.
It has been three years since this genocide began, and as the article notes, more than 3,000 Yazidi, primarily women and children, remain in captivity. The international community must no longer ignore the plight of the Yazidi.
It needs to stand up, comply with its legal obligations to prevent, suppress and punish genocide, and take immediate action to avert this genocide.
