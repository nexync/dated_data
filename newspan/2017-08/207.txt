But I don’t overexfoliate. Exfoliating a lot may make you look good in the short term, but not I think in the long term. I see many women in L.A. who have exfoliated so much they look shiny. I’ll use a mix of serums and oils depending on my skin that day. I love the Biologique Recherche Grand Millésime serum. Or I use the Anne Semonin Sérum Précieux.
It’s my natural color, and it’s my natural white hairs.  I don’t want to spend what’s left of my youth pretending I’m younger and then not enjoying life.  It’s the same with my eyebrows. They grow and grow until a makeup artist looks at me and begs to do something to them because they’re so much.
