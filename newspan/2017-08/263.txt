A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin against The New York Times, saying Ms. Palin’s complaint failed to show that a mistake in an editorial was made maliciously.
In the lawsuit, which was filed in June, Ms. Palin contended that a Times editorial that was published roughly two weeks earlier had linked her to a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona even though the news organization knew the connection was false. The editorial was published the day a gunman opened fire at a baseball field where congressmen were practicing for an annual charity game. Several people were injured, including Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana.
The editorial suggested a connection between a map of targeted electoral districts circulated by Ms. Palin’s political action committee and the 2011 mass shooting by Jared L. Loughner that severely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords. The Times later issued a correction, saying there was no link between political rhetoric and the shooting.
Ms. Palin said in the lawsuit that the editorial contradicted other articles in The Times that dismissed the idea that political rhetoric had incited the rampage. “The Times had ample facts available that established that there was no connection between Mrs. Palin and Loughner’s crime,” she said.
The Times filed a motion to dismiss the case in July.
The “actual malice” standard for defamation holds that public officials have to show that news outlets knowingly published false information or had acted with “reckless disregard” for the truth.
James Bennet, the editor of The Times editorial page, testified on Aug. 16 that he had not intended to blame Ms. Palin for the 2011 shooting. Instead, he said, he was trying to make a point about the heated political environment.
Lawyers for Ms. Palin did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
