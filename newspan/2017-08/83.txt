What did Bill Murray do today? Oh. Same-old, same-old.
Mr. Murray, for the second night in a row, went to see “Groundhog Day,” the musical about a man who keeps repeating the same day over and over again. He starred in the film version in 1993 in what is widely considered among his best performances.
This time, he came alone. A spokeswoman for the musical said that the show was given a heads-up that Mr. Murray might want to attend again and set aside a ticket for him.
On Tuesday night, he was accompanied by his brother, Brian Doyle-Murray, who played a town official in the film, as well as Danny Rubin, a co-writer of the movie screenplay and the writer of the book for the musical. He became visibly emotional during his first viewing of the show and repeatedly told delighted cast members that he would return to see the show again.
But no one thought Mr. Murray would return the next night. Perhaps he appreciated repeating a day all over again, like the film. After all: Do you know what today is? Today is tomorrow. It happened.
