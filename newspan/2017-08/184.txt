The noises outside the window of my second-floor apartment create the usual New York litany: sirens, car horns, a twittering bird resting briefly on a nearby tree. I eventually tune it all out, too busy drifting in my own head to register the changing soundscape.
Tonight is different: I can’t slip away into my head, even though I’m tired and trying to. Two men are arguing at the crosswalk below.
I can’t tell what the argument is about or when it started, but one of them keeps repeating: “You don’t call me!” He says it again: “I’m 51 years old. You don’t call me!” And again, maybe even a fourth time, but the volume drops, and I can’t make out the other man’s response.
They speak in quieter tones after that, so I resume trying to drift, phone in my hand as I browse apps and wait for my laundry timer to run down. I take a second to look at the list of people I messaged last and the list of people I called last. There isn’t much overlap.
I wonder, if we were to meet on the street now, how many of those on the first list would look at me and say the same — “You don’t call me” — and for how many it would be true.
