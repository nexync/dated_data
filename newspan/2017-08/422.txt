"Billy Elliot" trailer.
Where to Watch: Stream it on Showtime; rent it on Amazon, iTunes and other platforms.
Every Friday afternoon, the Watching team screens a movie during lunch, and this was last week’s pick. In a working class part of England during the mid-80s, an 11-year-old boy named Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) falls in love with the idea of ballet. His father, a masculine miner, wants him to box instead, and he forbids the boy from dancing. This effective coming-of-age drama melts into a warm, feel-good story about acceptance.
"James Baldwin: the Price of the Ticket" scene.
Where to Watch: Stream it on Sundance Now.
If Raoul Peck’s fiery documentary “I Am Not Your Negro” piqued your interest in all things James Baldwin (whose 93rd birthday would have been Wednesday), then try this movie as a companion piece. Now streaming on Sundance Now, this 1989 documentary is full of archival footage, recordings of Baldwin reading his work, old interviews, photographs and memories from friends like Maya Angelou and Amiri Baraka. Although some scenes, like a recreation of Baldwin’s fight with his father, haven’t aged gracefully, the documentary’s focus on Baldwin’s personal and creative life humanizes this literary legend.
"The Ruling Class" trailer.
Where to Watch: Stream it on FilmStruck.
To celebrate Peter O’Toole’s birthday (also Wednesday — he would have been 85), FilmStruck is streaming a set of his films, including “The Stunt Man,” “My Favorite Year” and “The Ruling Class,” which contains one of O’Toole’s strangest and most manic performances. He plays Jack, a newly minted Earl who suffers from schizophrenia and believes that he is God. When someone asks him how he can believe this, Jack answers, “When I pray to Him, I find I am talking to myself.” This 1972 black comedy is full of biting wit and satirical jabs at upper-crust British society.
