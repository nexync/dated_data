As has been the case several times this year, an airline had to issue an apology for an incident captured by cellphone cameras last Saturday.
This time, passengers of easyJet Flight 2122 were first seen losing their patience in Terminal 2 of the Nice Côte d’Azur International Airport in southern France. But ultimately, it was when an airport employee punched a man who was holding a baby in the face that caused an uproar.
EasyJet apologized and said the gate agent was not an airline employee. “We are concerned to see this — it is not an easyJet staff member & they do not work for our ground handling agents,” the airline said on Twitter.
It’s been a tough year for airline PR departments. Here is a sampling of regrettable moments.
