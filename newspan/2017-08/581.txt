 It’s a little amazing how a story so guilty of gross-out violence can retain a share of comic innocence.
That innocence begins and ends with Chip (Matthew Gray Gubler), whose batty girlfriend, Liza (AnnaLynne McCord), plans to rob her sugar daddy (David Maldonado) of the cash in his safe. The bumbling Chip is reluctant to help, but Liza is persuasive — she punches hard — and before you can say “They shouldn’t be bringing weapons to this supposedly nonviolent robbery,” everything hits the fan.
Some twists and double-crosses follow the theft, none of them too complex or entirely logical. But this movie is determined not to take itself seriously, and that makes it easy for you to do the same and cackle, even as the bloodshed turns ridiculously foul and cheesiness is played as a virtue.
Mr. Gubler and Ms. McCord’s characters are matched to maximum effect — he’s nervous, she’s violent — and Trent Haaga, the writer and director, races through scenes as if there were no time to waste, adding to the energy. Though his script is only half as clever as it should be, that’s enough to give the movie a daffy charm. Alisha Boe and Sheila Vand, in supporting roles, are by turns sexy and strange.
We’ll be “in and out like it’s nothing — nobody gets hurt,” Liza tells Chip as she plans the crime. It’s a ludicrous moment — there should be a neon sign above her head blinking, “Fat Chance.” In that scene and others, however, you find yourself laughing out loud, and minutes later, covering your eyes.
