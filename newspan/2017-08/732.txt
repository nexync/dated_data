In summer 1974, I was a young acting student working on a scene in Herbert Berghof’s class at the H. B. Studio on Bank Street. My scene partner was dating a fellow from France who lived in Paris but always seemed to be around her apartment when we were rehearsing.
After one rehearsal he showed me how he could ride a unicycle and juggle five balls at once. I was impressed.
A few days later, we all went around the corner to the White Horse Tavern after class and the Frenchman joined us. After I had had a few beers, I showed him that silly bar trick where you rest the bottom edge of a saltshaker on some salt on a table and blow away all the extra salt, leaving the shaker tipped at an angle.
My scene partner’s boyfriend had never seen this.
“This is fantastic,” he said in his thick French accent as he perused the shaker carefully and tried to figure out how I had done it.
As we were getting ready to leave, I asked him how long he was going to be in New York. About a month, he said. I asked what he would do while he was in the city.
“I am going to walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center,” he said.
About two weeks later my girlfriend’s alarm went off at about 7 a.m.
“We have a report of a man walking between the twin towers of the World Trade Center,” the voice on the radio said.
It was Philippe Petit I had wowed with my saltshaker trick.
