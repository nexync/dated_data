The Chocolate Factory Theater, a space for experimental performing arts in Long Island City, Queens, will put down roots there in a permanent home it recently purchased — in full, with no debt.
With financial help from the New York City government, the Chocolate Factory bought a 7,500-square-foot facility at 38-29 24th Street — close to its current home, and to other cultural institutions like the Museum of the Moving Image and MoMA PS1 — for $3.8 million.
Brian Rogers, the organization’s artistic director, said the assistance to buy the building outright came from the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the Department of Cultural Affairs, through allocations made by the City Council’s majority leader, Jimmy Van Bramer; the Queens borough president Melinda Katz; and Helen M. Marshall, a former president of the borough, who died in March.
By staying in Long Island City, the Chocolate Factory joins other arts organizations, including museums and Silvercup Studios.
