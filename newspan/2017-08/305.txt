Study Pershing, Trump Said. But the Story Doesn’t Add Up.
“There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!” he added in his Twitter post.
During a February 2016 campaign stop in South Carolina, Mr. Trump claimed that Pershing captured “50 terrorists” and shot all but one with bullets smeared in pig’s blood.
Various versions of this myth began circulating around the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, often in email chains and on discussion boards online.
And in another, in a column published in National Review in December 2002, a few months before the invasion of Iraq, the act was attributed to unnamed troops under Pershing’s command.
Further dispelling this event and the suggestion that it was highly effective and ushered in an enduring peace is its dubious timeline. Most versions of the tale say the episode occurred around 1911, but the Moro Rebellion officially lasted another two years. After 1913, Americans back home lost interest and United States troops withdrew.
Studying Pershing’s historically documented actions during the Moro Rebellion — generally “a carrots and stick” approach, Mr. Arnold said — confers no silver bullets on how to approach terrorism.
Pershing “understood the imperative of having American forces involved at the grass-roots level,” wrote Col. Robert M. Cassidy of the Army, a professor of strategy and policy at the U.S. Naval War College. But Pershing could also be brutal, killing women and children in one large battle, for instance.
To the extent that the Americans “won” over the rebels, Mr. Arnold attributes that to an outsize battle: The Moros had no outside support, were insulated on an island and were outgunned.
The rebellion is nevertheless relevant, Mr. Arnold said, in that “it was our first war against an Islamic insurgency” and the first that employed what is now called “nation-building” — which Mr. Trump has pledged to end.
