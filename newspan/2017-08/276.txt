Jeff Flake: We Need Immigrants With Skills. But Working Hard Is a Skill.
Manuel was just 16 when he made it from Sonora, Mexico, to the F-Bar, my family’s ranch outside the town of Snowflake, in Northern Arizona. I was just a kid, no more than 6 or so, and to me Manuel looked like a full-grown man. He wasn’t much more than a kid himself, of course, but he worked as if his family depended on him. They probably did. He couldn’t have worked harder if the ranch were his own.
Just as my family members bear the aches and pains of a lifetime of work on the F-Bar, so, too, does Manuel.  Those first years were interrupted more than a dozen times, when Manuel was picked up and returned to Mexico by the Border Patrol. Each time, he made his way back.
Manuel would marry in the late 1970s and obtain a green card, which awarded him permanent resident status. He and his wife, Frances, would ultimately raise seven kids — three boys and four girls, one of whom was adopted. All the Chaidez kids are contributing members of American society.
