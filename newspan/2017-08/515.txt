Such reform is way overdue. Approved by the General Assembly in 1990 and supported by the United States, the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of Their Liberty establish minimum international guidelines for young people in correctional settings that specifically prohibit the solitary confinement of juvenile offenders.
Itâ€™s beyond time to ensure consistent adherence to this reasonable and appropriate standard.
