Institutional investors own a growing share of rental properties in the United States, according to a report by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. This think tank based its conclusion on the 2015 Rental Housing Finance Survey, recently released by the United States Census Bureau, and earlier census data going back to 2001.
Individual investors still own more individual rental properties, as they did in 2001. But as of 2015, institutional investors — all other landlords, including partnerships, companies, trustees for estates and nonprofit organizations — made gains across rental properties of all sizes. Their majority share of rental units (52.2 percent) is the result of increased ownership of multi-unit properties, as shown in the chart.
But while the Harvard group cited evidence that institutional landlords may be more likely to initiate evictions, it conceded that the jury is still out on what kind of landlords institutional investors make.
