The three students were convicted because their disorderly and intimidating behavior broke the law during a protest. They were found guilty based on evidence presented in a fair and open trial.
Under Hong Kong’s common law legal system, like others around the world, both the prosecution and the convicted can seek an appeal of sentence.

Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are protected in Hong Kong’s Basic Law, our constitutional document, and underpinned by the rule of law and an independent judiciary. Hong Kong’s judicial independence is ranked eighth globally by the World Economic Forum (the United States is 29th).
Your eagerness to label the alleged kidnapping case of Howard Lam, a member of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party, as a “brazen crackdown” is also wide of the mark. Independent journalists have published evidence that contradicts his allegations. Mr. Lam has since been arrested on suspicion of misleading the police by false information.
