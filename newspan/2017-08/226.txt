But these high-profile examples are not a sign of greater representation in films over all. A new study from the University of Southern California’s Viterbi School of Engineering found that films were likely to contain fewer women and minority characters than white men, and when they did appear, these characters were portrayed in ways that reinforced stereotypes. And female characters, in particular, were generally less central to the plot.
While previous studies examined how frequently characters of each gender spoke, the school’s researchers went further by analyzing what was actually said.
Those creators are more often than not men. Of the films studied by Dr. Narayanan’s team, there were seven times more male writers than female writers, nearly 12 times more male directors, and over three times more male producers. When the writers were women, the number of female characters in a movie was 50 percent higher.
The study was one of two released recently by U.S.C. researchers that looked at diversity in film. The other, by the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, found that in 900 films released from 2007 to 2016, the percentage of speaking characters who were women never climbed above 32.8 percent.
Of last year’s top 100 films, 47 had no black female characters at all, 66 had no Asian female characters and 72 had no Hispanic female characters.
Madeline Di Nonno, the chief executive of the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, said it made financial sense for the film industry to embrace diverse creators and stories.
“It’s really important, to effect change, to talk about the social imperatives, but also you have to marry them with the business imperatives,” Ms. Di Nonno said.
