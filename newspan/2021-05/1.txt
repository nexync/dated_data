As the Boy Scouts of America goes through a contentious bankruptcy, dozens of lawyers are working on the case. Many are charging more than $1,000 an hour.
The high-stakes bankruptcy case has drawn in lawyers by the dozens to negotiate how to compensate tens of thousands of people who have filed claims of sexual abuse.
Mr. Schiavoni, the insurance company lawyer, said the fee examination process is not designed to explore what he regards as the real question, which is whether the fees are proportionate to the value of the services. In his legal filing last week, he proposed that the court hold back 20 percent of requested fees to be paid only once the case has been completed and the court can assess whether the fees are reasonable based on the scope of the resolution.
