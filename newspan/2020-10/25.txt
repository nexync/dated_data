Keith Raniere, the founder of Nxivm, had abusive sexual relationships with three sisters who joined his organization, the family said. Their father still supports him.
Camila�s mother, brother and a sister watched her from the audience, a rare reunion after Mr. Raniere had strained their relationship for years. Camila, now 30, said that when she finally left Nxivm in 2017, she struggled to trust them.
�I still don�t have a normal concept of family because of how he manipulated us away from each other,� she said.
The split within Camila�s family was one of the most devastating examples of how deeply Mr. Raniere had indoctrinated his loyal followers, turning husbands against their wives and children against their parents. To this day, some Nxivm defectors are still trying to pull their own family members out from the fog of Mr. Raniere�s ideology.
Former Nxivm members have said Mr. Raniere deceived them into believing that adhering to his purported curriculum would solve all of their problems. He taught them to distrust the media, doctors, experts � and any family members who called Nxivm a cult.
Camila was the first victim to speak at Mr. Raniere�s sentencing on Tuesday, where he effectively received a life sentence after his conviction last year on sex trafficking, fraud and other crimes.
Mr. Raniere began sexually abusing her when she was 15 and he was 45, she said. Their relationship lasted for 12 years and left her with lasting physical and emotional scars, including the trauma of getting an abortion at Mr. Raniere�s direction, she said.
The judge, Nicholas G. Garaufis of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, called the letter a �disgrace,� expressing disbelief that a father would support the man who abused his own daughters.
Marianna, the oldest sister in Camila�s family, had a son with Mr. Raniere and stayed in contact with him after his trial. She was living with him in Mexico when he was arrested in 2018.
Mr. Raniere�s inner circle had arranged for Marianna to receive $500,000 in 2017 and set up a trust to provide funds for her son, prosecutors have said.
Camila was later recruited into a secretive group within Nxivm that Mr. Raniere created in 2015. The group was promoted as a women�s empowerment sorority, but former members testified at trial that they were called �slaves� and forced to participate in a ceremony in which Mr. Raniere�s initials were branded near their pelvises.
Camila had previously refused to cooperate with prosecutors on the advice of a lawyer who was recommended to her by Mr. Raniere�s legal team. The lawyer had been paid for by Clare Bronfman, heiress to the Seagram�s liquor fortune, who has since pleaded guilty to her role in Nxivm and been sentenced to over six years in prison.
Camila left Nxivm in 2017 as a 27-year-old with no work experience or higher education. She struggled to find a job with such a large unexplained gap in her r�sum�.
Judge Garaufis was visibly moved by Camila�s speech, citing her testimony several times before he sentenced Mr. Raniere.
But when she developed feelings for another man, he ordered her confined to a room in her family�s house for nearly two years. She was told that if she left without permission, she would be cut off from her family. She slept on a foam pad on the floor and went months without human contact.

Adrian, the brother in the family, told the court that one of his biggest regrets was participating in Daniela�s torturous confinement. He was so loyal to Mr. Raniere that he shunned his mother for three years after she left Nxivm.
He described a long journey to unlearn Mr. Raniere�s indoctrination, which he said haunts him to this day.
