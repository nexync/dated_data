Having growing up in Edmonton, Alberta, I understand the pull of the province’s oil sands. As a climate activist and educator in the United States, I see the strong need for national and international climate leaders to spur and sustain climate action.
Most political leaders are taking the side of the oil companies or are working overtime to thread the needle as they try to represent both sides.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s decision to nationalize the Trans Mountain pipeline, to spur oil and gas development, shows that this needle-threading is an impossibility. He has clearly and loudly chosen the oil industry.
Our children and his are watching; scientists and Mother Nature are showing us that we are out of time. History will be his judge.
