I was born on June 22, the second day of summer. It is also the birthday of Kris Kristofferson and Meryl Streep, both of whom, I’m told, I later resembled, although not at the same time.
Sixty is a big round number, seeming to mark, once and for all, the difference between middle age and the thing that comes after that. Who else turns 60 this year? Madonna, in August. Prince and Michael Jackson would have, too, if they’d made it.
As for me, I had always hoped I would arrive at this age with equal measures of joy and acceptance — grateful for what has mostly been a happy life, even if wistful that there are surely more days behind me now than ahead. I had imagined myself on this birthday sitting in an Adirondack chair, listening to all my intolerable 1970s music (Gentle Giant! The Mothers of Invention! Fairport Convention!) while my loved ones expressed their adoration, prog-rock notwithstanding.
Well, there was plenty of that last week. We had lobsters and corn and steamers on the deck here in Maine. My wife, Deedie, put some candles in a blueberry pie, and everyone sang their hearts out.
But there’s a constant shadow hanging over everything now, even on the happiest of days.
In June 1958, I was born in a country in which a Republican president had recently signed the first civil rights bill since Reconstruction, marshaled Congress to spend millions of dollars to create the federal highway system, ended a war and, in collaboration with our allies, helped keep America at peace.

I was born in a country where people said, “I Like Ike.” I turned 60 in a country led by a man who doesn’t appear to like much of anything — excepting, of course, himself.
Who is to blame? In large measure, my generation. Americans 65 years and older — all my tie-dyed brothers and sisters — favored Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton by a considerable margin, seven percentage points, according to exit polls.
It’s shocking to me that so many of the people I grew up with reconsidered the whole all-you-need-is-love thing and decided, upon reflection, that all we actually need is a giant border fence to protect us from Mexican rapists. Also: military parades! Did I mention, uh, Space Force?
So, while I’m celebrating this birthday with gratitude I’m also determined, going forward, to keep fighting back as best I can. If that sounds pontifical and self-serving I hope you’ll forgive me. The elderly get this way.
We also are given to sharing unsolicited advice.
In that spirit — pull up a chair, sonny! — I offer the following additional observations about what it means to be 60 in 2018.
• First off, siblings are great, but never forget that sometimes what you need most are your cousins.
• It is fairly unlikely that anyone really wants to see pictures of your children, or your grandchildren, or your cat.
• Dogs are fine, though.
• Nothing tastes as good as being thin feels, except for maybe fresh pizza hot out of a wood-fired oven, garnished with kosher salt and freshly chopped basil leaves.
• It is unlikely you will ever speak a foreign language as well as you did in high school.
• It costs nothing to forgive people who have wronged you. Forever bearing the burden of anger, on the other hand, will eat you alive.
• It is impossible to lose weight unless you also stop drinking.
• If you have writer’s block, lower your standards, and then revise.
• You never stop missing your parents, no matter how old you get, no matter how long they have been gone. Or, for that matter, your children.
• It is possible to believe that whole chunks of the Bible are ridiculous without losing your faith.
• Admit when you are wrong. The older you get, the more frequently you’ll have the opportunity.
• Have a sense of humor about everything, including the things that are the saddest. And the state of the country not least.
I cannot say I’m grateful to Donald Trump and his enablers for bringing me to this point. But I am energized by the prospect of all the work at hand.
I may be old now. Fair enough. But this fight will make me young.
