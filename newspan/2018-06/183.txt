NAPOLEON DYNAMITE (2004) 5:55 p.m. on HBO. How do you take $400,000 and turn it into over $40 million? Most wouldn’t guess that the answer would come from a 24-year-old filmmaker and a cast and crew made up mostly of his college peers. Enter Jared Hess, whose idiosyncratic film about an awkward high schooler (played by Jon Heder) in a small town in Idaho, shot on a scrawny budget and without star power, struck an immediate chord with audiences, leading to those heavy-hitting box-office figures. Mr. Hess’s “mockery of the local quirks and delusions is grounded in both affection and impatience,” A. O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. While the follow-up 2012 animated sitcom of the same title floundered, the film continues to enjoy a cult following.

There is some discussion of the history of the technique, but the focus is on eccentric characters whose passion keeps the form alive.
