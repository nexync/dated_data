• President Trump and Kim Jong-un are in Singapore, with their on-again, off-again meeting — set to be the first encounter between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader — planned for tomorrow.
Some fear mismatched expectations. Few analysts believe that Mr. Kim is ready to give up his nuclear arsenal for the economic help Mr. Trump could offer.
They may not even define issues like “denuclearization” the same way. Here is a look at the issues behind the basic terminology in question.
And our Beijing bureau chief heard from analysts who say that Chinese leaders are suddenly jittery that Mr. Kim might try to counterbalance their own influence by embracing Washington.
• The meeting in Singapore comes directly after a contentious Group of 7 meeting.
While supporters rushed to defend the president (his top economic adviser said he was “not going to permit any show of weakness on a trip to negotiate with North Korea”), many others were dismayed.
• Malaysia’s new leader, the 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, above, is aggressively ramping up an investigation into the apparent theft of billions of dollars from the state investment fund established and overseen by his predecessor, Najib Razak.
The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that $4.5 billion went missing from the fund, known as 1MDB — including $731 million that it says was deposited into Mr. Najib’s own bank accounts.
Mr. Mahathir has made investigating the scandal and recovering the money a top priority. Mr. Najib denies any wrongdoing.
That was an environmental official speaking about New Delhi’s towering trash heaps. About 80 billion pounds of garbage have accumulated at four dumpsites on the fringes of a capital already struggling with dangerously polluted air and water.
The dumps in Delhi, and in cities like Mumbai and Kolkata, are some of the largest, least regulated and most hazardous in the world, a waste management expert said. Dislodged cascades can be lethal.
Politicians have been slow to react, but the government has now vowed to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022.
His death sent shock waves through the culinary industry — and through the small French village where he died.
In Vietnam, the owner of a noodle shop in Hanoi where Mr. Bourdain shared a $6 meal with former President Barack Obama in 2016, said she was shocked.
• Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have disagreed over the risks of artificial intelligence for years, including at a previously unreported dinner in 2014. Meanwhile, the fight over the future of A.I. has spread across the tech industry.
• A judge is expected to rule Tuesday on the U.S. government’s effort to block AT&T’s merger with Time Warner — an antitrust case that has enthralled Hollywood, Silicon Valley and Madison Avenue. Other headlines to watch for this week: U.S. net neutrality rules are set to expire, and the White House will release its final list of Chinese products subject to tariffs.

• And do bees know nothing? Researchers say bees have shown that they understand the absence of things as a numerical quantity: none or zero. The only nonhuman animals so far to show the same understanding are primates and a single African gray parrot.
But the island has a troubled past.
Until 1970, it was known as Pulau Blakang Mati, a reference to a hill there whose name means “Behind Death.” One theory holds that the island was long a sanctuary for the spirits of warriors who had been buried on an adjacent island (which was itself associated with piracy).
Pulau Blakang Mati was also the site of a then-mysterious epidemic (probably malaria) during Singapore’s British colonial era, and one of the places where Japanese soldiers killed thousands of Chinese male civilians after invading Singapore in 1942.
