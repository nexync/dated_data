Amanda Jill Ratner and Nicholas David Wood were married June 15. Peter M. Boruchowitz, a Universal Life minister, officiated at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
Ms. Ratner, 28, is an associate at NexPhase Capital, a private investment firm in Manhattan. She graduated from Vanderbilt.
She is a daughter of Dr. Marjorie J. van de Stouwe and Dr. Scott J. Ratner of Upper Brookville, N.Y. The bride’s father is a cardiologist in private practice in Franklin Square, N.Y. Her mother is a rheumatologist in private practice in Valley Stream, N.Y.
Mr. Wood, 29, is to begin as an associate at Citadel, a Manhattan hedge fund, in July. He graduated from the University of Virginia and is to receive an M.B.A. from Northwestern later this month.
He is a son of Lynn A. Wood and David L. Wood of Liberty, Mo. The groom’s father is the vice president of Westfall GMC Truck, a dealership in Kansas City, Mo.
The couple met in 2012, at their first jobs out of college, as analysts at McColl Partners, which was a small investment bank in Charlotte, N.C. As they sat down to dinner on their very first date, Ms. Ratner felt a tap on her shoulder. She turned to find that they were seated next to their boss. So even before their relationship commenced, it wasn’t a secret at work. But Mr. Wood said it was no matter. “We weren’t breaking any rules or anything,” he said.
