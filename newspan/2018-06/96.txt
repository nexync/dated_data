A frame from a video obtained by The Daily Orange, Syracuse’s student newspaper, in which members of the Theta Tau fraternity mime oral sex and use racial slurs.
The videos, which were recorded on March 30, were originally posted to a secret Facebook group called “Tau of Theta Tau” and later obtained by Syracuse’s independent student newspaper, The Daily Orange. The paper published two of the videos after the university declined to release them, citing its continuing investigation.
Mr. Germain acknowledged that the skits were in poor taste, but said that the fraternity members “were making satirical, antiracist jokes,” not using slurs against fellow students.
Robert Hradsky, the dean of students, announced Friday that the hearings and deliberations had concluded, saying that “the students were notified of their respective outcomes and subsequent sanctions.” But he did not share further details about the decisions, citing federal privacy laws.
According to Ms. Felter, two of the students accepted penalties offered by the university before the formal hearing, and one accepted a resolution at the conclusion of the hearing. The remaining 15, who were suspended, now have the option of appealing the decision, a process that could take several weeks.
“We are waiting for the administrative process to end so we can pursue legal action on their behalf,” Ms. Felter said.
Mr. Germain and others on campus have argued that the students’ right to free speech has been violated. But for many students at Syracuse, the videos — while distressing in and of themselves — are indicative of a larger problem.
