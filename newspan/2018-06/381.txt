Even as orchestra and opera seasons wrap up, the classical music world is hardly slowing down. The week began with news that Fabio Luisi would succeed Jaap van Zweden as music director of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra. Another conductor, James Gaffigan, is getting a high-profile gig at the podium of the New York Philharmonic’s parks concerts this month.
And summer festivals are already in full swing. So far we’ve written about Opera Theater of St. Louis, which is staging the premiere of “An American Soldier,” Huang Ruo and David Henry Hwang’s opera about Pvt. Danny Chen, a Chinese-American soldier who killed himself after a racist hazing in 2011. Also at Opera Theater of St. Louis is Marc Blitzstein’s “Regina,” starring the great mezzo-soprano Susan Graham — who, after decades playing amorous young men and tragic ingénues, is trying something new as a ruthless villain. Our critic Anthony Tommasini will review both operas next week.
Speaking of trying something new, be sure to read Seth Colter Walls’s story about young New Yorkers — we’re talking 12 to 18 years old — learning to play Anthony Braxton’s devilishly difficult music, which even some professionals consider unplayable.
