President Trump wasted no time after tying a bow on his meeting with Kim Jong-un to finally punch back, so to speak, at the actor Robert De Niro, who spent the last couple of days publicly slamming the president, going as far as to use profanity during the Tony Awards on Sunday night.
“____ Trump,” Mr. De Niro shouted into the microphone on Sunday, before introducing Bruce Springsteen. “It’s no longer ‘Down with Trump!’ It’s just ‘____ Trump!’” he said. The crowd gave him a standing ovation. Mr. De Niro flexed both of his arms.
“I watched him last night and truly believe he may be ‘punch-drunk,’” added the president, who was en route back to the United States from Singapore. It was unclear if he was referring to Mr. De Niro’s remarks at the Tonys or in Canada.
“Wake up Punchy!” the president concluded, after boasting about the United States economy.
Representatives for Mr. De Niro declined to comment on the president’s tweets.
About 15 minutes before posting about the actor, the president tweeted that he had gotten along “great with Kim Jong-un,” the North Korean leader. “Great progress was made on the denuclearization,” the president wrote.
And his tweet on Tuesday was not the first time Mr. Trump had called someone a “low IQ individual.” He used that same insult to describe Mika Brzezinski, the co-host of “Morning Joe” on MSNBC, in June of last year, and Maxine Waters, a Democratic congresswoman from California, in March.
