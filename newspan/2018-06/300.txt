It’s June. Here’s the Trailer for Your First Oscar 2019 Contender.
Timothée Chalamet earned an Oscar nomination this year for his performance in “Call Me by Your Name” as a young gay man who has a heartwarming bond with his father. In “Beautiful Boy,” Mr. Chalamet plays a meth addict whose relationship with his dad (Steve Carell) might better be described as heart-rending.
Judging by the film’s affecting trailer, which has just been released, Mr. Chalamet may find himself an awards-season presence again. Mr. Carell, who also stars in another year-end potential contender, “Welcome to Marwen,” could garner a second Oscar nomination as well (he was up for best actor for the 2014 drama “Foxcatcher”). “Beautiful Boy” reunites Mr. Carell with Amy Ryan, who played his love interest on the sitcom “The Office” and co-stars as his ex-wife here.
Adapted from the writings of David and Nic Sheff, a real-life father and son who chronicled their family’s struggles, “Beautiful Boy” seems to radiate a rare emotional verisimilitude. The film was adapted by Luke Davies and Felix Van Groeningen, who also directed and whose 2013 harrowing family drama “The Broken Circle Breakdown” was nominated for an Academy Award for best foreign-language film.
“Beautiful Boy” will reach theaters on Oct. 12.
