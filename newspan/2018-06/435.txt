ISTANBUL — On Sunday, when Turkey chose both a parliament and a president with sweeping new executive powers, I experienced the most uneventful election evening of my adult life. There was no real tragedy or comedy, just the repetition of something by now familiar: an electoral victory for Turkey’s conservatives.
I voted in the morning at a Greek school in my neighborhood, Cihangir, and I spent the next few hours in a mall, watching a movie. The silence as I returned home Sunday evening was unnerving. It was broken only when a car passed by my narrow street blaring a campaign song with this refrain: “Recep Tayyip Erdogan.” I knew what had just happened.
Turkey’s new Presidential Palace, modeled after the White House, will open its more than 1,000 offices to specialists working for the presidency. “We will make decisions faster; all services will be results-oriented,” Mr. Erdogan said while introducing the system.
