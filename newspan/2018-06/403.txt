Suzy Solidor was once on top of the world. Between the two world wars, this platinum-blonde siren wore several crowns as a queen of bohemian Paris: model, singer, entrepreneur, tastemaker, sexually polymorphous hedonist. Artists like Tamara de Lempicka and Man Ray captured her likeness, and she popped up in the 1936 film “La Garçonne” as the icily sensual star of a nightclub that doubled as an opium den. Viewers probably assumed she was playing herself.
In “All I Want Is One Night,” she adds another portrait to the 225 paintings and photographs of a woman who lived by her own rules. The show starts with the aging Solidor (Ms. Walker) dressed in a Navy uniform, insisting that she be called Admiral by visitors and her young maid, Giselle (Rachel Austin). The two women engage in perverse role-playing: “I don’t think Uncle has had his morning kiss,” Solidor teases Giselle, who complies.
Solidor’s songbook drew from the then-popular genre of tragic seafaring chansons. What was novel about the show was Ms. Walker’s unabashed way of delivering torch ballads not just about loving women but about having sex with them, as in the fairly explicit “Ouvre” and “Obsession.” The songs have been translated into English by Ms. Walker, yet retain a distinctively French flavor, bolstered by the music director Joseph Atkins on piano and accordion.
The evening does not shy from Solidor’s less savory side. She drank too much and could be wolfish in her seductions. She kept her club going during World War II — “collaboration is what makes me such a good lay, sweetheart,” the singer quips to her long-suffering partner, Daisy (Ms. Austin).
In the end, though, “All I Need Is One Night” suggests, delicately and with bemused affection, that what befell Solidor was rather banal: She grew old, and had trouble accepting that she was no longer the center of attention. It may well be the only ordinary thing she ever did.
