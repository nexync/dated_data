These days my now-scuffed bunny is in other hands. I’ve lent it to my sister Julie, who was given a diagnosis of ovarian cancer last fall. After three decades without a name, it now has one (“Ramelle,” after a character in Rita Mae Brown’s book “Six of One”). Friends have given Julie various good luck charms — new bling that Ramelle sports along with her fraying tutu.
