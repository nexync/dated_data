Some of the exercises in the popular workout are too difficult for athletes of a certain age or body type. Here’s how to make it work for you.
After the workout was first reported in The New York Times, dozens of 7-Minute Workout apps and videos were created to help us learn the exercises. Everyone was doing it. Everybody, it seemed, except me.
Even though the 7-Minute Workout sounds easy, the well-kept secret about the routine is that it can be really, really hard for some of us to complete. Recently, while attending a fitness seminar that included the workout, I saw several people struggling with many of the exercises. Triceps dip? Push-ups? Wall sit? For those of us with aging knees and elbows, overweight bodies or just the extra jiggle that comes with age, even the most basic jumping jack can be a challenge.
To build your own modified 7-Minute Workout for a beginner, choose an exercise from each muscle group below that you can do successfully using proper form, without pain. If you need to, you also can adjust the rest interval. Instead of five seconds between exercises, try 10 seconds and make it an eight minute workout, or rest 15 seconds and make it a nine minute workout.
And even if you pick the easiest exercise for you, the key is to push yourself hard for 30 seconds, so that you get the full benefit. It should be challenging, but not painful.
