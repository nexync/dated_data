Ms. Jackson previously played Lear in a 2016 production at the Old Vic in London. The Broadway staging, produced by Scott Rudin, will be a new one, with a creative team that has not yet been named; it is scheduled to begin previews March 6 and open April 11 at an unspecified theater.
Ms. Jackson, 82, is a renowned stage and film actress who won two Oscars before taking a two-decade detour to serve in Parliament. She returned to the stage with the British Lear production.
