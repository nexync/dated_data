This satirical novel, which won the Man Booker Prize, opens in the Supreme Court, where the narrator is appearing on charges that he is trying to reinstate slavery in his home and segregation in a local middle school in Dickens, Calif., where the narrator was raised by a single father. Dickens is an “agrarian ghetto” that has literally been disappeared from the map, and the narrator’s relationship with his neighborhood, as well as with his dead father, are at the heart of this outrageous story. “If not a classic, ‘The Sellout’ is destined to be a really good cult jam,” wrote our reviewer.
“New York City turns into a land of the Brothers Grimm — enchanted isles and magic forests, demon giants and glowing witches,” wrote Jennifer Senior in her review of this horror thriller. The story begins in 1968, with a love story that ends when Brian West abandons his wife and son, Apollo, when the boy is 4 years old. Fast-forward to the present: Apollo became a rare books dealer, and he and his wife, Emma, are new parents to a son named after his missing father. Then, Emma begins to behave strangely, until one day she attacks Apollo and the unthinkable happens to their child. What follows is Apollo’s desperate attempt to make sense of what happened to his family. LaValle’s horrors “keep hurting for a good while after the worst seems to be over,” wrote another reviewer.
