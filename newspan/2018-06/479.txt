Many dozens of free performances of every kind — surf rock, punk cabaret, mandolin orchestra, Bach — fill the city from dawn to nightfall each summer solstice for Make Music New York. The organizers and audiences got a gift this year on Thursday: clear, warm weather, the humidity manageable and the sounds, as ever, sweet. Our critics caught a small sampling of the offerings.
