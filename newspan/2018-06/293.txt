Kelly Anne McKenna and John Emory McRaven were married June 16 at St. Olaf, Patron of Norway Roman Catholic Church, in Williamsburg, Va. The Rev. Mark F. DeMott performed the ceremony.
Mrs. McRaven, 29, is a strategic consultant in New York for IBM, where she advises on corporate brand marketing with a focus on social media. She is also the president of the University of Notre Dame Club of New York, which is an association for alumni and their families. She graduated from Notre Dame.
She is the daughter of Margaret W. McKenna and Thomas J. McKenna of Williamsburg. Both retired as career counselors from private outplacement practice in Albany.
Mr. McRaven, 36, leads a development team in New York for Palantir Technologies, a software and services company that specializes in big data analysis. He graduated and received a master’s degree in electrical engineering from Notre Dame, and received a doctoral degree in physics from the University of California, Davis.
He is a son of Georgeann B. McRaven and William H. McRaven of Austin, Tex. The groom’s mother is a director of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation, which provides support to the families of Special Forces members who die or are injured in the line of duty. She is also the sponsor for the U.S.S. Ralph Johnson, a Naval destroyer that she will follow throughout its service. His father retired in May as the chancellor of the University of Texas system, and is the author of “Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life … And Maybe the World,” (Grand Central Publishing, 2017). He spent his career in the Navy, achieving the rank of admiral and last serving in Tampa, Fla., as the commander of special operations.
The couple met in 2014, when a mutual friend introduced them on the way to a Jets football game. Mr. McRaven was visiting from California at the time, and he says he was on his way over to introduce himself to Ms. McKenna anyway, as she was wearing a Notre Dame jersey.
