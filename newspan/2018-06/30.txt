This desire to simplify inspired Dance to set out to create the perfect pair of jeans — one that would cover all occasions, and that could be dressed both up and down. After a four-year process of research and refinement, the 35-year-old designer arrived at what she believes to be the answer: a mid-vintage-wash, nonstretch, straight-leg, button-fly pair of jeans.
Style-wise, they evoke vintage jeans — the kind you might see in Richard Prince’s photography series “Cowboys & Girlfriends” — before the terms “stretch” and “skinny” entered the denim vernacular. “Vintage jeans always felt more authentic,” says Dance, adding, “I always wanted jeans that made me feel like Bob Dylan more than something I’d seen in a magazine.” A longtime denim aficionado, Dance was drawn to retro styles but also wanted to make something more contemporary.
