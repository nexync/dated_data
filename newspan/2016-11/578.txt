When Phife Dawg, the Everyman hero of A Tribe Called Quest, died in March of complications from diabetes, it had been almost 18 years since the seminal hip-hop group — Q-Tip, Phife, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and sometimes Jarobi White — had released an album as a unit.
But after a rousing reunion performance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” last fall, the group had been plugging away at new music. And in late October, seven months after Phife’s death, Q-Tip announced the imminent release of “We Got It From Here, Thank You for Your Service,” the group’s first album since 1998, and also its last.
A Tribe Called Quest has a unique legacy in hip-hop — a historically minded group that blended philosophical and bohemian impulses with street-friendly themes and sounds.
In advance of the new album, the writer Touré spoke with the remaining members of A Tribe Called Quest, still distraught over the loss of their friend and collaborator. On this week’s Popcast, I speak with him about his experiences interviewing the group over the years, its polyvalent legacy, and how it fits into the current hip-hop landscape.
