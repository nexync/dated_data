We boarded Donald J. Trump’s plane for an inside look at his last stand. He’s betting big on less educated white voters. And even if he loses, his campaign’s legacy will live on, in the form of emboldened extremists.
Here’s our live coverage of the last hours of the race. We’re offering unlimited access to NYTimes.com for the election, from now through Thursday morning.
• Hong Kong is bracing for street protests and tough questions about the independence of its courts after China barred two pro-independence city politicians from taking their seats in the legislature.
The move could open an era in which Hong Kong’s elected officials can be punished if they fail to meet a vague standard of political loyalty to the central government.
• China’s new cybersecurity law gives the authorities far greater control over the internet as of next summer.
Its requirements — including real names for messaging services and security checks in the finance and communication industries — are raising concerns about freedom of speech and barriers to foreign businesses.
• Australia will not legalize same-sex marriage anytime soon. A bill that would have allowed for a plebiscite on the issue was shot down in Parliament over the $140 million cost and concerns that it would become a platform for hate speech.
Polls show around 70 percent of Australians want marriage equality, and many supporters of legalization want action in Parliament, not a nonbinding plebiscite.
• Heavy smog continues to choke New Delhi, where schools are closed and emergency measures are in place to improve air quality that is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.
• The Philippine Supreme Court is expected to rule on whether President Rodrigo Duterte may transfer the remains of Ferdinand E. Marcos, the country’s former dictator, to a heroes’ cemetery in Manila.
The justices have another Duterte case on the docket: a senator who has often been critical of him has asked the court for an order to stop him from retaliating with verbal attacks, which have included speeches in which he called her a “dirty woman” and discussed her private life.
• Warner Bros., a division of Time Warner, is often in the shadow of its sibling HBO. Kevin Tsujihara, above right, the film studio’s chief executive, wants to change all that.
• China will release its balance of trade figures — how its exports and imports compare — for October, offering another data point for the health of the country’s economy.
• The Sotheby’s auction house reported a loss of $54 million in the third quarter, citing a slowdown in the art market and the purchase of an advisory business.
• U.S. markets surged on election news, and the dollar was up. Here’s a snapshot of global markets.
• Janet Reno, the first woman to serve as U.S. attorney general, died at age 78. She played a major role in some of the most divisive episodes of the presidency of Bill Clinton.
• The world’s youngest chess grandmaster, 26-year-old Sergey Karjakin of Russia, is about to challenge the reigning world champion in New York.
• A new study finds that whale songs need to be felt as well as heard. The sounds are accompanied by vibrations that course hundreds if not thousands of feet through the water, possibly enhancing whale-to-whale communication.
• A Chinese Paralympic champion was nowhere to be seen at the finish of the New York City Marathon. Turned out her wheelchair had blown a tire at Mile 13 — so three people, aided by a translation app, stepped in to help. “It really was a cool New York moment,” one said.
Britons have been saying a lot of goodbyes in the past few months.
It’s a play on “taking French leave,” which the British use to mean departing abruptly — supposedly a reference to the French manner of leaving a social function without saying goodbye.
Such nationalist expressions abounded around the 19th century, when rival nations in a disunited Europe settled scores in wars, revolutions and slights.
Of course, the slaps don’t end with departures. Germans can mention, though rarely, “English shopping” — that is, theft, as in the colonial past.
And references to historic battles get drawn into the mix, too. So the French could say, depending on how Brexit works out, “c’est un vrai coup de Trafalgar,” a true Trafalgar blow, reminiscent of their decisive defeat by the English in 1805.
Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Accessing this version of the briefing should help.
