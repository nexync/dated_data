Q. I live in a pet-friendly co-op in Riverdale, in the Bronx. Unfortunately, I am highly allergic to dogs and cats. When pet owners wash their pets’ clothes and bedding in the common laundry room, some of them do not clean out the hair from the lint catchers in the dryers, leaving me to clean it out. This has triggered several allergic reactions. When I asked the board to set aside specific washers and dryers for the pet paraphernalia, it refused, saying pet owners should have unlimited access to all machines. Do any city rules address this problem? And what can be done to mitigate my problem?
A. Despite what your co-op board seems to think, it is possible to be both friendly to pet owners and sensitive to the needs of people with allergies.
Because you have found a hot spot that exacerbates your allergy, the board should do what it can to accommodate your disability. Designating washers and dryers for pet-related laundry would not cost the building money, nor would it burden other residents. “This board is wrong, and it may pay a very steep price if sued for discrimination,” said Andrew P. Brucker, a partner of Montgomery McCracken Walker & Rhoads.
By dismissing your concerns, the board may also be violating the city’s Human Rights Law, which requires landlords and building owners to provide reasonable accommodation for residents with disabilities.
If you were to sue the board for discrimination, a judge could order it to comply with your request and award you financial damages. “Discrimination is illegal,” Mr. Brucker said, so board members would not be protected by building insurance and could be held personally liable.
Hire a lawyer to write a stern letter to the board. This should be enough to put the matter to rest. If the board does not relent, you could file not only a discrimination lawsuit, but also a claim with the New York City Commission on Human Rights.
