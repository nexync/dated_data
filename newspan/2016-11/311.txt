Plenty of shows go badly on Broadway. But rarely does one do so intentionally.
Now comes “The Play That Goes Wrong,” a British farce born in a pub, that has been running in the West End of London since 2014.
The slapstick comedy, in which a company of hapless actors makes a disastrous attempt to stage a 1920s murder mystery, is coming to Broadway next year, beginning previews March 9 and opening on April 2 at the Lyceum Theater, the producers said Monday.
The producing team includes J.J. Abrams, the Hollywood director and writer (“Star Wars: The Force Awakens”), making his first foray into theater production.
The writers met as drama school students working on improvisational theater and initially staged “The Play” as a one-act comedy in a theater above a pub in London. Mr. Lewis said the team had been inspired, in part, by a book about bad acting, as well by the films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin.
The original British cast will come to New York for the production, which will be directed by Mark Bell and produced by Kevin McCollum, Mr. Abrams, Kenny Wax, Stage Presence and Catherine Schreiber.
“Our goal is to have it become a long-running show in New York,” Mr. Lewis said.
