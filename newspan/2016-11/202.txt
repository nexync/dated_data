For several years, the oils sold with the Stony Brook label have been pressed from organic squashes in western New York. The company has added a sunflower-seed oil to its portfolio. Made from locally grown sunflowers, the oil is cold-pressed and unrefined, with a charming, nutty flavor. And itâ€™s reasonably priced, making it a fine alternative to extra-virgin olive oil: Stony Brook Organic Finger Lakes Sunflower Seed Oil, 12.7 ounces $8.95, 25 ounces, $12.95, wholeheartedfoods.com.
