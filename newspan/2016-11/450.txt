LONDON — The New Jersey-born broadcaster, writer and comedian Amy Lamé has been appointed here to the splendid-sounding title of Night Czar. The position was created by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has promised to make the nighttime economy a priority.
In creating the Night Czar position, Mr. Khan follows cities including San Francisco, Amsterdam and Berlin, which have hired night mayors to look after the night life of their cities.
Ms. Lamé, 45, was chosen out of some 200 applicants. She has lived in London since 1992 and is a naturalized British citizen who is well known as a radio and television presenter, and was the mayoress of the borough of Camden from 2010-2011. In 1995, Ms. Lamé was a founder of the performance club and collective Duckie, which performs at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, a well-known L.G.B.T. spot she campaigned vigorously to save during recent threats to its future as a theater.
Ms. Lamé will be tasked with creating a broad plan for the development of London’s nighttime industries. She will work closely with the local authorities, the police and Transport for London, which began to operate subway lines all night in August. She will also work with the Night Time Commission, a group formed by the previous mayor of London, Boris Johnson, to balance the needs of the nighttime economy and those of the city’s residents.
