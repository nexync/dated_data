Do you trust the integrity and truthfulness of the news you get through Facebook or other social media platforms?
Have you ever seen false information or hoaxes spread like wildfire there, only to discover later they were fake or untrue? How reliable is the news you read on social media? What examples can you give?
1. The article says that the recent presidential election demonstrates that social networks “are helping to fundamentally rewire human society” and even “alter the course of global events.” What examples from the article support this?
2. How did President-elect Trump use social media to help him win the election, according to the article?
3. What social movements elsewere in the world does this article mention as having been powered by the web? Do you see these as mostly positive, or negative? Why?
4 What is the Overton Window? How and when, according to the article, did the internet shift that window for politicians?
5. How has the internet given power to previously isolated fringe groups and once-maligned, unhappy people? What are two examples of these groups or extreme perspectives?
How has social media increased its power as a means to inform, for good or for bad? Do you think social media shields its users from opposing viewpoints, keeping them in a “filter bubble” of their own making?
As an experiment, find someone who feels very differently than you do about a hot-button topic that is in the news. Then, swap Facebook or other social media platforms and see what comes up.
