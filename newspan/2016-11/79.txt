If the ballot initiatives to legalize recreational cannabis pass on Election Day, you’ll be able to road trip through Nevada, Arizona and the entire West Coast without having to hide the weed.
Residents of Western states are more likely to use marijuana, according to the Centers for Disease Control. And the West has a long history of tolerance toward cannabis.
One reason, some historians say, is that social permissiveness has governed the region since the Gold Rush days.
“Leadville, Colo., and San Francisco were disproportionately male, young and single. Those were places that had a lot of commercialized vice,” David Courtwright, a history professor, said.
Most Western states were admitted to the Union in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Their constitutions often make it easier than ones in older states to organize ballot initiatives — which is how most states have legalized marijuana so far.
Politics aside, the money to be made in marijuana is significant. The legal market is projected to grow to $7 billion this year, and up to $22 billion in 2020. That’s why investors are pouring millions into the referendums.
Apparently they’re drawn by the spirit that fueled the Gold Rush: turning natural resources into fortunes.
