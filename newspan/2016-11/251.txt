MOSCOW — A criminal conviction of a key opposition leader, Aleksei A. Navalny, was overturned on Wednesday by Russia’s Supreme Court, formally opening the door for him to run for office.
Mr. Navalny was convicted in 2013 by a court in Kirov, Russia, and sentenced to five years in prison on charges of embezzling timber worth $500,000 from a state-owned company. In a surprise move, that court suspended the sentence shortly after it was announced, but the criminal conviction remained in force, barring Mr. Navalny from being a candidate.
Mr. Navalny appealed to higher courts in Russia, and also had his case heard by the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled in February that Russia had violated his right to a fair trial. The human rights court ordered the Russian government to pay damages and reimburse his legal costs, a ruling that is legally binding on Russia.
Mr. Navalny said on Wednesday that he was not satisfied with the Supreme Court’s decision to wipe out his conviction and order a new trial of the case.
Mr. Navalny said the ruling was meant to continue to hamper his political activities.
Two months after his conviction in 2013, Mr. Navalny received more than 27 percent of the vote in a race for mayor of Moscow, a better showing than any other open critic of the Kremlin in a major election campaign since President Vladimir V. Putin’s rise to power in 1999. The ban on Mr. Navalny’s running for office took effect later in 2013 when a higher court upheld the conviction.
Russian investigators opened a number of criminal cases against Mr. Navalny, in what he said was a deliberate campaign to thwart his political efforts. He and his brother, Oleg, were convicted in late 2014 on charges of defrauding a Russian subsidiary of Yves Rocher, a French cosmetics company; Aleksei Navalny’s three-and-a-half-year prison term in that case was suspended, but Oleg Navalny’s was not.
