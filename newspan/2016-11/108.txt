The lack of subtlety in its title tells you what you need to know about “U.S.S. Indianapolis: Men of Courage,” a dramatization of an almost unbelievable World War II catastrophe. The film, directed by Mario Van Peebles, brays the story in broad strokes and clichés as if the horror of it didn’t speak for itself, which it most certainly does.
The Indianapolis was the cruiser that in 1945 carried parts of the atomic bomb that was to be dropped on Hiroshima to Tinian Island in the Pacific, where the weapon was to be assembled. The mission was secret, so the ship traveled without escort. It successfully delivered its cargo, but on its way to its next assignment, the Indianapolis was sunk by a Japanese submarine, leaving about 880 surviving crewmen in the water. Rescue didn’t come for four days, by which time hundreds had died, some from shark attacks.
The film’s leaden treatment of this incredible story somehow sucks all the drama out of it. Nicolas Cage plays the ship’s captain, Charles McVay, but the script by Cam Cannon and Richard Rionda Del Castro never offers him a chance to do much more than stare ahead earnestly and bark orders. An assortment of secondary characters are given story lines too flimsy to register, and the special effects are equally rickety. The most interesting part of the film is its treatment of Capt. McVay’s subsequent court-martial (he was exonerated decades later), but this stretch, too, feels like a missed opportunity.
“U.S.S. Indianapolis: Men of Courage” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for gory shark attacks.
