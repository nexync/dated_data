A belated apology: At a performance of Gounod’s “Faust” at the Metropolitan Opera in 2013, I created a minor disturbance during the aria “Avant de quitter ces lieux” that affected a dozen or so patrons in Row J, an equal number in Row I and several people in Row K, while also eliciting a dirty look from the soloist.
In the aria, the character Valentin has been called up to battle — let’s face it, he was drafted — and though he has been given an amulet by his sister Marguerite, he is asking the Lord to protect her should he not make it back.
Amid the sounds of muffled explosions on the stage, a projectile (shrapnel?), from somewhere between the parterre and the family circle, arced over the orchestra seats and glanced upon my cheek. Of course I was startled (and the cause of the ruckus), but in the same moment my date, with the catlike reflexes of Clete Boyer, snatched the object before it could create further mayhem. Regardless, I heard a decided murmur go through the crowd. The offending object? A yellow peanut M&M.
This has never happened to me before; I’m reasonably sure it will not happen again. I’m sorry.
