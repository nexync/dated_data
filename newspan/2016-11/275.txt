Penn State (10-2, 8-1) edged No. 2 Ohio State for the East title, setting up a conference championship game against the West winner, Wisconsin, next weekend in Indianapolis. The Nittany Lions beat the Buckeyes, 24-20, at home on Oct. 22.
McSorley set a single-season team record for total offense and led the Nittany Lions with multiple deep passes in the second half, in which they outscored the Spartans, 35-0.
He threw a 34-yard touchdown pass to Chris Godwin down the sideline on Penn State’s first possession of the third quarter, and he followed it with a 45-yarder to Mike Gesicki on the Nittany Lions’ next drive. Godwin broke loose up the middle minutes later, and McSorley hit him in stride for 59 yards to give Penn State a 31-12 lead and cap a 21-point quarter.
Andre Robinson added 14- and 40-yard touchdown runs in the fourth quarter for Penn State, and Saquon Barkley scored on a 1-yard run in the second. Barkley appeared to injure his right leg in the third quarter and did not return.

COLORADO 27, UTAH 22 No. 9 Colorado (10-2, 8-1) won the Pacific-12 Conference’s South Division title by surviving against No. 21 Utah (8-4, 5-4) with a senior-laden defense that forced two fumbles by the Utes’ star running back, Joe Williams, in Boulder, Colo.

KENTUCKY 41, LOUISVILLE 38 A 47-yard field goal by Austin MacGinnis with 12 seconds left allowed visiting Kentucky (7-5) to upset No. 11 Louisville (9-3), a result that may have opened up the race for the Heisman Trophy, in which Cardinals quarterback Lamar Jackson has been a favorite.
Louisville appeared to be headed for a go-ahead score late in the game before a Jackson fumble at Kentucky’s 10-yard line was recovered by the Wildcats’ Courtney Love with 1 minute 45 seconds left. Stephen Johnson then led Kentucky downfield and into position for MacGinnis’s game-winning kick, which ended a five-game losing streak for Kentucky in the series.
Jackson’s desperation heave from deep in Louisville territory was snagged by Mike Edwards, his second interception of the game.
Despite the loss, the Cardinals’ second straight, Jackson, a sophomore, might have wrapped up the Heisman. He recorded a team-record eighth 100-yard rushing game and broke the single-season team mark for rushing yards. His four scores (two passing, two rushing) also pushed him to the A.C.C.’s single-season record for total touchdowns, at 51.
U.S.C. 45, NOTRE DAME 27 Adoree Jackson returned a punt and a kickoff for touchdowns and also caught a scoring pass to propel No. 12 Southern California (9-3) to its eighth consecutive victory, this one over visiting Notre Dame (4-8) in the 88th edition of their famed intersectional rivalry.

Florida State rushed for 249 yards.
W. VIRGINIA 49, IOWA ST. 19 Skyler Howard threw for 330 yards and tied a career high with five touchdowns, and No. 19 West Virginia (9-2, 6-2 Big 12) rolled past host Iowa State (3-9, 2-7).

NAVY 75, S.M.U. 31 Will Worth accounted for four touchdowns while becoming the first Navy quarterback to finish with more than 100 rushing yards and 100 passing yards in three consecutive games, and the Midshipmen (9-2, 7-1 American Athletic Conference) thrashed Southern Methodist (5-7, 3-5) in Dallas.
