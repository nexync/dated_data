Midsize grocers, the fast-expanding and perennially packed Trader Joe’s aside, are also struggling. Garden of Eden, a 22-year-old chain with only three remaining stores in Manhattan, filed for bankruptcy over the summer. D’Agostino, opened in 1932, is down to nine locations from a peak of 26 in 1996. The remaining were teetering, their shelves bare, until John A. Catsimatidis, the owner of Gristedes, delivered a $10 million line of credit in August, with plans to eventually merge the two companies.
The city has tried to convince grocers to stay with its Fresh program, which provides incentives to establish and retain neighborhood grocery stores. Fresh “made it really attractive for developers,” said David J. Maundrell III, the executive vice president of new development for Brooklyn and Queens for Citi Habitats, a real estate brokerage.
