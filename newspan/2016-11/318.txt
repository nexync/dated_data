How much bloodshed can a divided populace stand? In Stephen Apkon and Andrew Young’s documentary, “Disturbing the Peace,” we meet Combatants for Peace, an advocacy-activist group comprising Israelis and Palestinians who have reached their limit and renounced violence. Most are former military or paramilitary personnel seeking a two-state solution to Israel’s agonized convulsions. Their stories are compelling — and persuasive.
The movie doesn’t examine in detail Hamas’s attacks on Israel or the construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, or even outline recent political developments. Rather, it briefly offers wrenching images (a bombing in Tel Aviv; razed Palestinian homes) before delving into the personal histories of members of Combatants for Peace. The transformations they describe are less like lightning bolts and more like dawning epiphanies.
One member, Chen Alon, an Israeli Army veteran, denied clearance at a checkpoint to a Palestinian father desperate to deliver his sick children to a hospital. Mr. Alon, a father himself, realized Palestinians can be loving parents as well.
Shifa al-Qudsi, a Palestinian, who lost teenage cousins and a sister-in-law in the conflict, planned to blow up a supermarket. Apprehended beforehand, she was imprisoned for six years. There she met a guard who lost a brother in a suicide attack, and Ms. al-Qudsi, too, recognized her adversary’s humanity.
