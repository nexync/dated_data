FRIDAY PUZZLE — A terrific start to our weekend by Peter Wentz, with a central stack and intersecting long Down entry that is just awesome. How could you not like GINGERBREAD COLDHEARTED BARMITZVAHS, with CONDOLEEZZA RICE “dropping in”?
This is a clean and crunchy puzzle, with a lot of very lively entries. Some of my favorites include BACKSPACE, BILLY ZANE, DUMPSTER, the above-mentioned central stack, NINE HOLES, ICE PALACE, NEWS DESKS, BABALU, CONDOLEEZZA RICE, MEATHEAD, SAME OLD, CAR JACKS and, for some reason, TRIBAL.
■ 1A: I loved this, once I got it. “Go over again, as one’s writing?” sounds like it should be about proofing one’s work, but it’s really about using BACK SPACE as a verb.
■ 10A: A tough one, unless you are a Dostoyevsky expert. He was exiled to OMSK, which might be gettable by using the Downs, once you’ve stopped snickering over the clue for 10D.
■ 33A: You have to be at least 13 years of age to become a BAR MITZVAH, although you can become one at any age after that.
■ 36A: “Put down on canvas?” is not about painting today. It’s about boxing, so the answer is KO’D.
■ 32D: We’re supposed to be thinking about literally taking the ride, so the answer is CAR JACKS.
This is a bit of an odd puzzle for me. I like the individual entries as much as any other crossword I’ve constructed, yet it doesn’t have the cohesive feel I normally strive for. From the preponderance of proper names in the upper left, the INs pileup in the lower left, and a couple more abbreviations than I normally like to use, something feels a bit off. Ms. Rice crossing the three central entries still looks good though, so at least the heart of the puzzle remains strong.
I’m pleased to see that many of my original clues made the cut, and as always, the changes were universally upgrades. My favorite discovery while reviewing the final version was 33-Across.
Luckily for solvers, I tend to be a poor judge of how my puzzles are received, so hopefully it’ll go over better than in my mind. Enjoy!
