But there’s more to it than Yiddish. Schor’s account of Zamenhof’s dreams and disappointments, including the religious ideas that he — and he alone — saw as essential to Esperanto’s mission, turns into an increasingly anecdotal survey of the language and its culture in the century since Zamenhof’s death. Although Esperantists refer to themselves as samideanoj (from the English “same idea”), Esperantujo seems never to have lacked for either colorful characters or the “dirtiness of fighting” that George Orwell, whose aunt Nellie was one of those characters, ascribed to the so-called international languages: Schor looks at Marxist Esperantists, Stalinist Esperantists, Nazi Esperantists and anti-traditional Far Eastern Esperantists, along with the samideanoj she encounters in her travels. Author of a biography of Emma Lazarus, Schor is less assured as a memoirist than as a scholar, and while these latter sections are not without some interest, they go on at greater length than the material warrants. This is, however, a minor quibble. In portraying a language condemned by both Hitler and Stalin, then used by the American military as the language of the pseudo-Communist “Aggressor” in a lengthy series of Cold War maneuvers, “Bridge of Words” leaves us in no doubt that whatever Esperanto might be doing, it seems to be doing it right.
