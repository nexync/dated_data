More than two decades after John Dwayne Bunn was found guilty of murdering an off-duty New York City correction officer in Brooklyn, a judge on Tuesday threw out his conviction, citing a history of wrongdoing by a former detective who worked on the case.
In her decision, Justice ShawnDya L. Simpson of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn ordered a new trial for Mr. Bunn, saying that “malfeasance” by the former detective, Louis Scarcella, had undermined the evidence that led to Mr. Bunn’s conviction and eventual term in prison.
Mr. Bunn was the latest defendant to have a guilty verdict overturned in a case related to Mr. Scarcella, whose tactics led to the wrongful convictions of more than a dozen people, according to the Brooklyn district attorney’s office. A special division in the office, the Conviction Review Unit, is examining scores of cases, many of them involving him.
In 1991, Mr. Bunn, then 14, was arrested on charges of killing Rolando Neischer in the Kingsborough housing project in the Crown Heights neighborhood. According to trial testimony, two men on bicycles had approached a parked car in which Mr. Neischer was sitting with another officer, Robert E. Crosson, and ordered them to get out. A gun battle followed and Mr. Neischer was fatally wounded. Mr. Crosson, who was shot and wounded in the fight, survived and eventually identified Mr. Bunn and a second man, Rosean S. Hargrave, as the gunmen. Both men were later convicted of Mr. Neischer’s murder.
“This has been a really long haul for John,” said Glenn Garber, Mr. Bunn’s lawyer. “He has lost a lot of hope and this has finally restored his faith in the system. Today justice was served.”.
