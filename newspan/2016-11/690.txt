Fake stories and memes that crop up during live news events have been a problem on social media for years, but a wild election season has highlighted the news media’s slow response to them.
On Election Day, we asked our readers to send in some examples of what they were seeing. Here’s what we heard.
Hoaxes often gurgle up from the bowels of Facebook, as shares from sites that claim to mix satire with the truth, like The Rightists, or sites that don’t seem to exist for any particular reason but to fool people, like one called The Denver Guardian.
Another account purporting to belong to Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and a supporter of Donald J. Trump, is a fake.
• Fake sites were going into overdrive. Here’s a recent example from The Denver Guardian. On Saturday, that site claimed that an F.B.I. agent connected to Hillary Clinton’s email disclosures had murdered his wife and shot himself. The story was fabricated, and The Denver Post published a detailed report explaining that The Denver Guardian was a hoax.
• Fliers were distributed to trick college students. The Bangor Daily News reports that were fliers left on the campus of Bates College, in Maine, telling students that if they wanted to vote in Lewiston, they would have to pay to change their driver’s licenses and re-register any vehicle in the city. These sorts of hoaxes are common on college campuses.
He soon deleted the post.
Needless to say, Tuesday is Electing Day for all Americans, regardless of their political affiliations.
Other falsehoods are spread by seemingly well-meaning entities — corporate accounts and misinformed individuals — who trumpet claims that turn out not to be true.
• An inaccurate guide was distributed to voters. Urban Outfitters on Monday tweeted an Election Day guide that contained wrong information, telling voters that they needed a “voter’s registration card” along with their identification to vote. There is not a single state that requires such a card.
The retailer has since corrected its guide.
• Incorrect information was circulating at the polls. Anni O’Connor, 53, of Paradise Valley, Ariz., reported on The New York Times’s Facebook page that she overheard a woman in line at her polling place say that all her friends had voted online already. Ms. O’Connor, who had been an independent voter for many years but registered as a Democrat to support Hillary Clinton in this year’s primary, said she told the woman to alert her friends that they had not voted.
There is no state in which votes can be submitted online, though a few states make exceptions for military and overseas voters.
While Mr. Brown is correct that two Florida election clerks were removed from their duties on Tuesday, it was in Broward County, not Miami-Dade.
Tonya Edwards, a spokeswoman for the Broward County elections supervisor, confirmed that two clerks had been removed from their duties before noon, and had been replaced by other poll workers.
Asked to elaborate, she said that they had “obstructed and interfered” with the voting process but could not give any more information. She said that the episode had not ended up affecting anyone’s ability to vote.
• CNN corrected a tweet from Mr. Trump. The Republican nominee tweeted on Tuesday that Utah officials had reported problems with voting machines across the country.
Later, Jake Tapper, a CNN anchor, addressed Mr. Trump’s tweet during a live broadcast.
• A tweet about a “rigged” voting machine in Philadelphia was shared more than 11,000 times. But it was user error, according to ProPublica’s Electionland project.
On Election Day and in the days afteward, Snopes and BuzzFeed, two operations that vigilantly debunk fake news sites, will be useful.
First, a note: A growing tendency to dive into our own echo chambers and construct our personal versions of the truth on social media has been destructive to the ability to call out misinformation online. A post that contains an opinion you disagree with isn’t necessarily “fake” or “inaccurate.” We’re looking for stories that seem designed to misinform the reader.
• Check the account history of the source. One red flag is usually the number of posts and the span of time the account has been active. Is the story one of 50 coming from a Facebook account that was created just last week? It warrants a deeper look.
• Images are often reused from one live event to another to deceive people. Do a reverse-image search with a service like TinEye. The site should tell you if the photo has been used elsewhere.
• Check for context. Distortion is a powerful tactic used by sites designed to mislead the public. Images, videos and text snippets will be chopped, twisted and stuffed into a new headline to fit an inflammatory new narrative.
In one example cited in a recent BuzzFeed study, a site called Freedom Daily wrote fake details around a months-old video to make it seem like two white men had been beaten and set on fire by supporters of the Black Lives Matter Movement. The story was, in fact, a dispute between two co-workers, and BuzzFeed found that it had nothing to do with racially motivated violence.
But it got a lot of shares.
