His view fits with the post-election conventional wisdom: that Democrats must do better appealing to the white working class to regain power. I largely agree, but I also think that Democrats need to be careful about alienating their current constituencies — particularly since many of those constituencies are growing.
So I spent some time yesterday looking for critiques of Lilla, to think through their arguments.
All of these arguments make a vital historical point: This country’s deep racial problems stem from discrimination, not from oversensitivity about discrimination. And it would be a terrible mistake for anyone to shy away from criticizing Donald Trump’s alarming choices for attorney general and chief White House strategist.
At the same time, there’s a reality that Democrats would be foolish to underestimate. This country’s political system — the rules for electing both Congress and the president — is biased toward large, sparsely populated areas. Those areas tend to be overwhelmingly white.
Unless Democrats can win more support from white voters than they did this year, the party will be left to complain about the country’s political situation rather than do something about it.
