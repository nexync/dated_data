WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump’s transition was in disarray on Tuesday, marked by firings, infighting and revelations that American allies were blindly dialing in to Trump Tower to try to reach the soon-to-be-leader of the free world.
Former Representative Mike Rogers, who had been advising the new administration on national security issues, has been fired from the transition team.
