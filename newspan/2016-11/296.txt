Kurt Rawlings threw for two scores and ran for 74 yards to lead Yale to a 21-14 victory at Harvard on Saturday, ending a nine-year losing streak against its archrival and depriving the Crimson of a fourth straight Ivy League title.
On a sunny day that was warm enough to encourage some Yale students to dance naked on the concrete walls of century-old Harvard Stadium — they were then kicked out — the universities renewed one of the oldest rivalries in sports, in the 133rd edition of the game known as the Game.
The Bulldogs (3-7, 3-4) went ahead for good with 4 minutes 14 seconds left on a 3-yard touchdown pass from Rawlings to Reed Klubnik, who had the ball knocked out of his hands just after he reached across the goal line. Harvard coaches protested along the sideline, but there is no replay in the Ivy League.
The Crimson (7-3, 5-2) had two possessions in the final minutes to try to tie the score, but they could not.
After one kneel-down, Yale students poured out of the stands to celebrate with the team at midfield. Harvard players walked glumly back to their field house after blowing a chance to become the first class to win a fourth straight conference championship.
