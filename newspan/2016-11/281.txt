How Does the City Decide What Trees to Prune, and When?
Q. Many of the branches of the trees on my Upper West Side block have been cut, presumably for safety’s sake. Ditto my favorite Osage orange tree along the outer loop inside Central Park. Who decides which trees are a safety hazard? And who decides on the amount of cutting?
A. The process of deciding who prunes New York City trees, and when, and why, all starts with a detailed count of the trees, said Jennifer Greenfeld, assistant commissioner for forestry, horticulture and natural resources with the New York City parks department.
“Every 10 years we do a census, with every tree on every street over five inches in diameter counted, so we know exactly how many trees there are, and can factor that into our tree-pruning budget,” Ms. Greenfeld said.
Bough and branch clipping runs on a cycle: “The way we look at it, you have an ideal pruning cycle, and in that ideal cycle every tree should get proactively pruned every seven to 10 years. For the last eight years, we’ve achieved pruning on that seven-to-10-year cycle, usually closer to seven years.” But not all trees are shorn equally, and all are assessed before the saws and loppers come out.
“We deal with conflict, like if a tree is growing too close to someone’s house, and what we call ‘structure,’” which takes into account the tree’s age and how it’s growing, she said.
What the parks department does not deal with are trees growing up into power lines. Ms. Greenfeld said that was Con Edison’s job.
The trees on the Upper West Side block mentioned in the question were last pruned by the department in 2014, and no permits for tree work there have been issued since then.
