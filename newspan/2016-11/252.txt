In the new political drama “Miss Sloane,” Jessica Chastain’s titular lobbyist explains how to win in Washington. 
Set for release on Friday, the film is filled with echoes of rhetoric straight from the campaign trail. But in the aftermath of Donald J. Trump’s presidential victory, has the story of a tough woman trying to make a difference in Washington been overtaken by current events?
The filmmakers acknowledge that their project plays very differently than it would have had Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump. But they say they can’t control how “Miss Sloane” will be perceived by filmgoers and critics in light of the election outcome.
A two-hour-plus drama about a divisive issue represents a gamble in the superhero-driven marketplace, and the odds against “Miss Sloane” may have increased since Mr. Trump’s victory.
“I’m sure they’re very nervous to be releasing a movie with an explicit political theme when the whole political landscape has suddenly changed,” said the film historian Peter Biskind, the author of “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,” who has not seen the movie.
An unexpected resonance with headlines can cut either way for a movie’s box-office prospects. “The China Syndrome” became a hit in 1979 after an accident at the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania moved nuclear-safety issues to the forefront. In more recent years, acts of mass violence may have depressed domestic turnout for films like “A Good Day to Die Hard,” released in 2013 after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings.
