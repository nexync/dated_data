Low-Income Housing: Why Not in My Neighborhood?
When low-income housing is built, do nearby property values suffer?
Trulia looked at 3,083 low-income housing projects completed between 1996 and 2006 in the countryâ€™s 20 least-affordable markets to see whether such construction affected the values of neighboring homes. With a few exceptions, the presence of low-income housing seems to have had no impact.
The study found the values of nearby homes and those farther away rose at about the same rate. Two exceptions: Boston and neighboring Cambridge, Mass., where nearby home values fell. In Denver, nearby home values rose.
