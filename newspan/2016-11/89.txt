The harvest had just begun when agents from the Immigration and Naturalization Service stormed across the onion fields of Vidalia, Ga., in 1998, sweeping up 21 immigrants who were trudging behind tractors without legal authorization to work in the United States, pulling onions out of the ground for 75 cents per 50-pound bag.
And immigration enforcement caved: Shortly after the raid, onion growers in 19 counties were granted a temporary amnesty to keep their workers as long as their paperwork looked legitimate.
Sure. But where does that leave Donald Trump’s supporters? To Larry Bartels, the political scientist at Vanderbilt University, the apparent shift in Mr. Trump’s position is unsurprising. Politicians don’t follow the interests of average voters, he argues, they hew to the interests of the rich.
In his book “Unequal Democracy,” published this year, Mr. Bartels offered a snapshot of voter preferences in 2006, before the onset of the financial crisis. On the bottom of the income scale, most voters supported policies to provide jobs and equalize incomes. But at the top, most opposed them. The picture was reversed when voters were asked about cuts to government spending. The rich were much more supportive than the poor.
And what did voters get? After a brief flurry of fiscal stimulus to stop the economy from careening into the abyss, they got a round of automatic budget cuts called the sequester.
The transformation of Mr. Trump’s populist agenda into a rather more orthodox list of Republican goals may well follow the same script. His proposal for huge tax cuts — which would reduce federal revenue by as much as $9.5 trillion over a decade, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center — would shower favors mostly on upper-income Americans.
Even as he backs away from mass deportation, Mr. Trump is now talking about “modernizing Medicare,” echoing Paul Ryan, the House speaker, who wants to weave his goal of replacing government-sponsored health care for the elderly with vouchers to buy private insurance into the campaign promise to overhaul the Affordable Care Act.
Finally, while Mr. Trump has pitched deregulation — notably the repeal of President Obama’s Clean Power Plan — as an engine for job growth in the nation’s Rust Belt, he is also set to deliver enormous gains to Wall Street by undoing core provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was established to hem in the financial sector and prevent a repeat of the crisis of 2008.
There is definitely a silver lining if Mr. Trump is really letting go of the most extreme elements of his agenda. The economic and social dislocation that would be caused by deporting 5 percent of American workers would be immense.
Nafta may not be the best agreement in the world; China certainly cheats. But igniting trade wars with the nation’s biggest trading partners would not improve the livelihoods of America’s working class.
But the only real sliver of good news for blue-collar workers, is in Mr. Trump’s proposal for infrastructure spending on a yet unspecified but surely huge scale. But how will Mr. Trump’s base respond if that program is financed largely by temporarily cutting corporate taxes to 10 percent or so to encourage businesses with profits parked abroad to bring them home? And would it be enough to restore prosperity to the working class?
For decades, political analysts on the left have been perplexed by working-class Americans who give their vote to a Republican Party whose motivating principle revolves around delivering tax cuts to the rich. This time around, however, they delivered their vote to a Republican who promised to directly address their plight.
He has already come up short. Oxford Economics, under its most upbeat assumptions — a big tax cut and infrastructure spending delivering a lot of economic stimulus while new trade barriers are limited — foresees growth picking up for a while before falling back to the rate of roughly 2 percent a year that the United States has been living with for the last seven years. If Mr. Trump pursues all-out protectionism, however, Oxford Economics predicts the American economy will plunge into recession.
Under either situation, the frustrated working-class voters who cast their vote for Mr. Trump are likely to remain as frustrated as ever: stuck with insufficient education in a world of low growth and diminishing opportunity. Maybe they will figure out that most of the industrial jobs they lost are gone for good, that protectionism can’t bring them back, and that the main driver of their plight is technological change.
Deporting a couple of million “bad hombres,” in Mr. Trump’s words, and engaging in a some prominent trade spats may let off some political steam. But otherwise it won’t help.
The critical question then is not so much how Mr. Trump’s supporters will respond politically but how Mr. Trump will react to their inevitable disappointment.
Mr. Rodrik — who is generally sympathetic to the notion that globalization has gone overboard, imposing opaque global rules on democratic governance — still worries about Mr. Trump’s response.
