A Japanese amusement park shut down a skating rink that included 5,000 dead fish and sea creatures frozen into the ice. Space World was inundated with complaints after the rink opened two weeks ago.
TOKYO — The Japanese are known around the world for turning fish into centerpieces of culinary art. But an amusement park’s recent effort to pair frozen fish and ice-skating proved less enduring.
Two weeks ago, Space World, on the southwestern Japanese island of Kyushu, opened an ice-skating rink that featured about 5,000 fish and other sea creatures frozen beneath the surface.
Yet rather than attracting more visitors, the Aquarium on Ice ended up alienating them. A public furor broke out on social media, with many accusing the amusement park of cruelty to animals.
On Sunday, Space World apologized on its website, saying it would close the rink until further notice.
“We regret this terribly,” he added.
NHK reported that the park would melt the rink to remove the fish and planned to hold a memorial service for them. It may also use the dead sea creatures as fertilizer.
According to the Japanese news media, the fish, crabs and other shellfish were already dead when the amusement park bought them at a wholesale market. The park also placed photographs of larger fish, like whale sharks, under the ice.
Not all visitors were appalled by the exhibit.
