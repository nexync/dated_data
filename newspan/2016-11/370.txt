The documentary “Off the Rails,” Adam Irving’s first film, is an assured and thoughtful debut. He presents the story of Darius McCollum, a man with a long history of taking New York City subway trains and buses for joy rides even though he is not a transit employee. But Mr. Irving’s subtext is a criminal justice system that has no way to deal with an offender like Mr. McCollum, who has Asperger’s syndrome, other than to keep throwing him in prison.
Mr. McCollum’s résumé will be familiar to New York audiences, since he has been making news for decades, beginning when he first took unauthorized control of a subway train at the age of 15. Now in his early 50s, he has been in and out of jail repeatedly for stealing trains and buses, which he seems to want only to take for a ride, no malice intended. His advocates explain that Asperger’s can result in a single-minded devotion to a particular thing — in Mr. McCollum’s case, transit. He knows the schedules and terminology, and even has a collection of transit-worker uniforms.
Mr. McCollum, who comes across as the world’s most genial repeat offender, is the principal guide to his story, which includes being stabbed in school by a fellow student when he was 12. That may have shaped his later notoriety.
The news media has treated Mr. McCollum sometimes as a quirky New York character, sometimes as a menace. “Nut’s 24th Ride to Jail,” reads one headline seen in the film. Mr. Irving, though, treats him with dignity, and as an example of someone the justice system is not made to help. Offenders driven by a psychological compulsion are a decidedly different type of criminal than a hit man or a Ponzi-scheme operator, but, this perceptive film laments, they end up in the same jails, a response that hasn’t changed during Mr. McCollum’s 35 years of riding and recidivism.
