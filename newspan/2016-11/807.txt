LOS ANGELES — Is fashion art? Designers and historians have long bickered over the question. But in this city, where designer labels often underwrite major museum fund-raisers, fashion is undisputedly one of art’s biggest patrons.
Mr. Michele exchanged giddy embraces with the actresses Brie Larson and Gwyneth Paltrow in front of Chris Burden’s “Urban Light” installation. He also soulfully chest-bumped the musicians Jaden Smith and ASAP Rocky.
“I’m a fan of Renaissance art and the masters because that’s where it all started,” said Rocky, who looked appropriately baroque in fur-lined loafers by Gucci.
Michael Govan, the museum’s director, and Eva Chow, who presided over the gala with Leonardo DiCaprio, welcomed art world A-listers like Catherine Opie, Doug Aitken and the night’s two honorees: the Oscar-winning filmmaker Kathryn Bigelow and the installation artist Robert Irwin.
After cocktails on the mezzanine, more than 550 guests traipsed across the museum’s plaza to dine on coq au vin in a tented space with thousands of silk flowers on the ceiling.
In the lull before dessert, attendees flitted from table to table like high schoolers in a cafeteria. Demi Moore compared the height of her heels to those of the DSquared designers Dean and Dan Caten. Ms. Paltrow huddled with Courtney Love and Salma Hayek, conspiring like a prom committee.
Also, at this party you could eavesdrop on Mr. DiCaprio as he smoked a cigarette while in line for the portable restroom. “John Baldessari: so great, right?” Mr. DiCaprio said before he slipped inside, still puffing away gaily.
