How can one not be moved by “The Spanish Lesson I Never Got at School,” by Héctor Tobar (Op-Ed, Nov. 15)?
Here’s a concrete suggestion in line with his experience as a Spanish-speaking child who learns the deeper value of being truly bilingual: Develop programs for immigrant children to become the language mentors to those Americans — of any age — who desire to become bilingual.
Instead of looking down, inadvertently or intentionally, at children whose first language is not English, and discouraging their self-confidence, let’s look to them as our teachers.
In preschool and K-12 schools and maybe in businesses, social services and retirement communities, let’s recognize that these native-speaking youngsters have an enormously valuable asset the rest of us can directly and effectively benefit from.
Such programs would speak volumes to our country’s commitment to helping all of us be all we can be. And improve our country’s ability in so many ways to communicate effectively with people, governments and businesses all around the world.
At the senior center in Michigan City, Ind., octogenarians are learning Spanish, French and German. The instructors are volunteers. The students have a variety of reasons to learn a new language, ranging from keeping their brains active to getting more out of their travels to other countries. Others, like Héctor Tobar, know that it will be rewarding to understand the language of their parents.
Those of us at the senior center will attest that it is much easier to learn a language when you are very young.
It is obvious that if millions more Americans spoke more than one language, the country would be better off and more unified!
