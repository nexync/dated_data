LONDON — The peaks are slimmer and the valleys are wider, but the price hasn’t changed.
The 170-gram and 400-gram milk chocolate bars (about six ounces and 14 ounces) have been cut down to 150 grams and 360 grams to reduce costs, because of rising prices for ingredients, said Mondelez International, which makes the bars. The altered shape is visible only once the box is opened.
The effect of the alterations on the signature shape of the 400-gram bar, which is sold across Europe, was less noticeable, a company spokeswoman said.
The change, which was announced on the Toblerone Facebook page last month, is in keeping with a common strategy for companies trying to avoid price increases by reducing the contents of a product without changing the packaging.
Most consumers are unaware of the changes because the product usually looks and is priced the same — there is simply less of it — but the newer, gappier Toblerone bar felt treasonous to the brand’s loyal consumers.
“The key part of a Toblerone is the Alpine shape of peaks,” Fiona Prince said on Facebook.
The change to the 400-gram bar was made early this year, and the 150-gram version appeared in British discount stores last month.
The Matterhorn in the Alps is said to be the inspiration behind the pointed bar, and is featured on some of the packaging, but Mr. Tobler’s sons have said their father was inspired by a line of dancers at the Folies Bergères cabaret in Paris.
Mondelez International noted that while the overall look of the bar is different, the recipe remains the same and the chocolate is still made in Switzerland.
