There are two possible explanations for James Comey’s decision to announce last week that he was examining emails that “appear to be pertinent” to the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.
We know his announcement went against policy and tradition, which call for the F.B.I. to stay out of politics. Earlier this year, in fact, the F.B.I. decided not to pursue cases involving Trump and Clinton to avoid meddling in the election. The Justice Department strongly urged Comey not to make his recent statement about the so-called new evidence.
What law enforcement officer, by the way, announces that he is going to conduct a search before even obtaining a warrant?
Which brings us back to self-righteousness.
Comey’s former reputation as an upstanding guy was based on one gutsy act — stopping President George W. Bush’s minions from getting a barely conscious Attorney General John Ashcroft to authorize Bush’s illegal wiretapping operation while Ashcroft lay in an intensive care unit.
And now Comey is telling his staff that he felt compelled to tell Congress about the extra set of emails (which the F.B.I. most likely already saw in its original investigation) because, well, golly, he promised he would keep Congress informed.
It’s just not believable.
The idea that he wanted to help his political party is pretty terrifying. But the idea that he acted out of moral self-righteousness is not much more reassuring, given the immense powers of his office.
The division of America on so-called moral lines has been profoundly damaging. It led from Jerry Falwell’s founding of the Moral Majority in 1979 to the so-called “family values” campaigns of the 1980s, to the misogynist, racist and xenophobic politics of Trump and the Republican far right.
Barry Goldwater, a real conservative if there ever was one, was outraged by the rise of morality politics in the Republican party.
