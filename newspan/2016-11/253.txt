Columbia University said Friday that it would punish members of its wrestling team who had shared lewd and racist text messages and that the remainder of the team had been cleared to resume competition.
The university said in a statement that its investigation had found that the messages “were written, sent and viewed by a distinct group within the wrestling team.” Those responsible, it said, have been suspended from competition for the rest of the season and for the 2016-17 academic year, while others were barred from competing until the beginning of the spring semester.
The wrestling team had continued to practice but was forbidden to compete until the investigation was completed. Those found not to have been involved in the group messaging were cleared to resume wrestling, starting this weekend at the New York State Intercollegiate Championships at Cornell.
In its statement, Columbia did not name the wrestlers who were disciplined or disclose how many had been punished.
Columbia’s announcement came hours after members of the wrestling team apologized for their “inappropriate, vulgar and hurtful” speech in a letter posted late Thursday night on Bwog, an independent, student-run Columbia news website. Bwog first revealed the offensive messages when it posted images of the texts, which included the use of racist, misogynistic and homophobic language.
Columbia withdrew from its season-opening meet last Sunday at Binghamton. The team’s season was then left in limbo Monday as university officials investigated the texts. On Monday night, a group of Columbia students protested inside Dodge Fitness Center, where the university’s athletic teams have offices and the wrestling team holds its matches.
