Now, Deller has cast Iggy in a startlingly different light, with his latest exhibition, “Iggy Pop Life Class,” which opens at the Brooklyn Museum this week. For the show, Iggy sat as a life model for a four-hour life drawing class this past February in front of 22 students culled from New York’s art schools. The resulting 53 drawings are paired with selected art objects from the Brooklyn Museum’s historical collection that focus on the male body: sculptures from ancient Egypt, Africa and India, as well as pieces by Egon Schiele and Robert Mapplethorpe.
