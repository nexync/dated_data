Pencils of Promise, a New York-based nonprofit that builds schools, funds scholarships and trains teachers in the developing world, has bet heavily on social media since it started in 2008. Natalie Ebel, the group’s director of marketing, said it was paying off.
The organization’s dual emphasis on near-total transparency and high-quality storytelling (it builds customized websites for donors and has even commissioned a virtual reality film) aims to address three areas it has identified to successfully engage millennials online — gratification, simplicity and urgency.
Many of those lessons are now percolating through the whole sector, experts said, as organizations small and large learn from relative newcomers.
At United Way Worldwide, the nation’s largest charitable organization, local chapters have intentionally reframed their fund-raising pitches and experimented with new technologies and incentives to pull millennials into their well-known workplace campaigns.
Specific, vivid causes have replaced the broad buckets from which donors would once have chosen, and greater emphasis is placed on a gift’s impact on the local community, according to Lisa Bowman, United Way Worldwide’s chief marketing officer. The nearly 130-year-old organization has also set out to expand mobile giving and so-called one-click giving options, which are popular among young people.
With almost 10 million donors contributing $5 billion annually, the stakes of these kinds of efforts for United Way are particularly high. But as millennials mature and are eventually expected to carry more of the sector’s fund-raising burden, their success could determine how philanthropy evolves.
That said, Mr. Feldmann said organizations looking for a “silver bullet in a tactic” to help attract younger donors need not worry too much, at least if the work they are doing resonates.
