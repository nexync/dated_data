Two former private investigators have sued GlaxoSmithKline, charging that the drug maker misled them and induced them to investigate an innocent person, resulting in their imprisonment.
The complaint, filed at the United States District Court in Philadelphia and made public on Wednesday, was brought by Peter Humphrey, who is British, and Yu Yingzeng, his wife, who is American.
The couple were detained in 2013 and found guilty by a Chinese court in 2014 after being asked by Glaxo to investigate a whistle-blower within the pharmaceuticals group.
They were convicted of illegally obtaining private records of Chinese citizens.
The couple said that Glaxo misled them by stating that the whistle-blowerâ€™s accusations of widespread corruption within the company were false. The company was fined a record 3 billion renminbi (nearly $500 million) in 2014 for paying bribes to doctors to use its drugs.
