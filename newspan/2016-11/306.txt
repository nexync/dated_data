WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said on Monday that it would deploy more than 500 people in 28 states on Tuesday to monitor Election Day practices and guard against intimidation and disruptions.
The number is a sharp decrease from the 2012 presidential election, when the Justice Department had more than 780 personnel in place on Election Day at the close of what was a much less tumultuous campaign.
Officials placed blame for the shrinking federal presence on a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that limited their ability under the Voting Rights Act to deploy observers in jurisdictions — mainly in the South — with a history of voting discrimination.
The Justice Department said it would have personnel in 67 jurisdictions to look for signs that anyone is being hindered from voting because of race, ethnicity, language, disability or other criteria.
The department’s Civil Rights Division will also have a hotline to field complaints of discrimination or voting problems (1-800-253-3931 or |||PHONE_NUMBER||| , or TTY |||PHONE_NUMBER||| ).
The Justice Department is deploying both Election Day observers — inside polling places — and monitors, who remain outside the polls unless local voting officials agree to allow them inside. The department did not break down how the more than 500 people would be split between the two groups.
Donald J. Trump has repeatedly warned of what he said could be a “rigged” election, charging that illegal immigrants and others who are not eligible to vote could turn out in large numbers; he has urged supporters to monitor polls on their own.
Democrats say that the divisive climate could intimidate legitimate voters, and that evidence of actual voter fraud is minimal.
