SATURDAY PUZZLE — If you found yourself floundering in the center of today’s puzzle, there’s a good reason for it. All I’ll say, in the interest of not giving it away here, is that punctuation matters.
David Kahn reports in his notes below that he is typically a themed puzzle maker, so today’s central entry in an otherwise themeless grid makes for a surprising yet challenging addition.
If you need more help solving than that and would like me to whisper the trick in your ear, lean in closely and click here.
Even without this surprise, there are quite a few fresh and lively entries in Mr. Kahn’s grid. We’ve got SEX SCENE, REPORT GENERATOR, HOME PHONE NUMBER (even though we’re seeing fewer of those these days), I’M GLAD, NO REASON, SUPER BOWL CHAMPS, GETS INTO TROUBLE, KEY CARDS and TOP HAT.
■ 1A: #TodayILearned a rugby term: NO SIDE, or the end of a match. This is opposed to curling, where the entire match is called the end.
■ 14A: The key in this clue is the word “works.” Today it’s a noun, not a verb, so the answer is OPUSES.
■ 25A: Not an actual letter that one would write. The clue “Overnight letter?” refers to one who lets (or rents) space to someone, and a three-letter “overnight letter” would be an INN.
■ 33A: I knew this because “NEW YORK, NEW YORK” was the song that the college bars played at last call. So I heard. I never closed a bar when I was in school, Mom.
■ 60A: You can act willfully by being stubborn, or you can look at the clue a bit differently and see that “Acting willfully?” could also be interpreted as having a will, or being TESTATE.
I’m more into writing themed puzzles, but occasionally I’ll write a Saturday with a minitheme or special gimmick, just to surprise solvers. This is one of them.
The fun part for me with a Saturday puzzle is to see how hard or tricky you can make the clues; hopefully, solvers will have a good workout.
Thanks, I needed that workout, Mr. Kahn. Heaven knows I don’t get enough exercise.
