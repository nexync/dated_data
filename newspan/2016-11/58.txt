Wendy Range, 51, became homeless in 2010. She signed up to vote during a voter registration drive this year, and cast her ballot this morning before her volunteer shift at the soup kitchen.
At 7 a.m. on Monday, the line for the soup kitchen snaked through a hallway of St. Bartholomew’s Church in Midtown Manhattan as men and a few women, bundled in layers of worn jackets and sweatshirts, waited for a breakfast of mixed greens and egg noodles with beef donated by the nearby Waldorf Astoria.
On Tuesday, a handful of soup kitchen regulars will stand in lines at polling places around New York City to cast their votes in a presidential contest where the struggles of poverty rarely made their way into the national debate.
But with the help of the League of Women Voters, volunteers with Crossroads Community Services, a nonprofit founded by the church, held voter registration drives in August and September. Homeless people are guaranteed the right to register to vote in New York despite not having fixed addresses as a result of a lawsuit argued by the Coalition for the Homeless in 1984.
Wendy Range, 51, signed up, registering for the first time since the 1990s. “It was too important to not have a voice,” she said.
Ms. Range said she left an abusive home in Dansville, N.Y., where she was discriminated against as a teenager for being gay. Now, she chuckles at the memory of her first vote at 18 when she supported Ronald Reagan. But she grew serious when discussing how her failure to vote over two decades began with apathy and was reinforced by poverty.
Ms. Range, who had attended college and had worked on lighting crews for Off Broadway shows, said her finances grew tenuous in 2008 and she lost her job to budget cuts in 2010. She said she could no longer afford her $1,500-a-month studio in Chelsea and became homeless.
As of Wednesday, there were 36,520 adults in city shelters overseen by the Department of Homeless Services. As a voting bloc, homeless adults could be powerful, but many are uninterested and overwhelmed. “They are living in crisis and dealing with a lot of immediate needs, and that may prohibit them from voting,” Giselle Routhier, policy director at the Coalition for the Homeless, said.
The organization distributed around 1,500 fliers in shelters for single adults last week, Ms. Routhier said. The flier says voting could influence local and federal housing policies. “At all levels of government, these people have the power to impact your lives,” she said.
Vance R. Hinton, who registered two years ago, agreed that voting is an important civic duty, but at the same time he questioned what impact homeless people could have.
Born and raised in Harlem within earshot of “the organ and cheers” of Yankee Stadium, Mr. Hinton, 62, went to college with the help of basketball scholarships but fell on hard times after a longtime relationship ended in 2003. He said he once called a sleeping bag in Central Park home but lived these days on the E train.
After his meal, Mr. Hinton sipped coffee and opined.
He wondered which of the candidates really cared about the issues that affect him.
