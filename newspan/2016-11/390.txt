Many thoughts swirled through my head as I watched “This Moment After,” but the main one was: Please don’t start crying in front of the actress!
I was sitting mere inches away from Myra Lucretia Taylor in a snug booth, and we held eye contact as she performed “This Moment After.” Written on the heels of the recent presidential election, and poised between despair and hope, this monologue by Regina Taylor (the women are not related) may be understated. But add the feelings stirred up by the political climate and you get a potent combination — especially in extremely close quarters.
Regina Taylor wrote her current piece on very short notice to replace “Déjà Vu,” which took place before the election. On a recent afternoon, I caught brief plays by Bill Irwin and Lee Blessing, as well as hers. The program offers five additional works, by such playwrights as Charles Mee, Naomi Wallace and John Guare, who have all had full-length work presented by Signature over the years.
Theater for One, created by the noted set designer Christine Jones, boils the live experience down to its essence: the relationship between performer and audience, face to face. The forced intimacy can be exhilarating, and it can be terrifying. At times, I wished I could avert my eyes, but looking away felt rude. No wonder people hide behind their phones nowadays: This communication business is tough.
It was actually acceptable to gaze down at Lorenzo Pisoni’s hands in Mr. Blessing’s “This Magic Moment” because Mr. Pisoni was working a deck of cards: His character was reminiscing about performing sleight-of-hand tricks for his child. The monologue erred on the side of sentimentality, but Mr. Pisoni underplayed it, and his hands moved with an eloquent grace.
Mr. Irwin performs his own “He Built This,” a piece very much in his dramatic mode, as opposed to his vaudevillian one. There is a beautiful final twist to his monologue, so let’s just say that Mr. Irwin makes the most of his surroundings.
