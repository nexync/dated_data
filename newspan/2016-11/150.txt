Despite a longstanding fear of snakes, for many years the British artist Clare Strand sought out images of women with serpents. “People usually collect what they like, not what repels them,” she admits, but she felt somehow compelled.
Growing up in a suburban household with “a heavy emphasis on pragmatism,” Strand, it was decided, was destined for a career as an air hostess. After graduating high school, she enrolled in a travel and tourism course, to ill effect: “On the first day, I realized it wasn’t for me and left again,” she says. What interested her more were the images relating to crime and the paranormal that she’d started searching out on visits to the local library. While working her way through short-term jobs in London, she borrowed a friend’s camera and started producing images of her own.
In several recent exhibitions, Strand has drawn on her archive as both raw material and inspiration. In “Conjurations” (2007-2009), she reimagined early trick photography to create pictures of levitation and other hackneyed staples of the popular magician’s repertoire. In “The Entropy Pendulum” (2015), an image from a news archive is slowly erased by the arm of a mechanical pendulum scraping back and forth across its surface. Currently showing in the Netherlands, “All That Hoopla” (2016) is a brightly colored, fairy-lit fairground stall at which visitors throw wooden rings to win prints by the artist (5 euros for 3 rings, or 8 euros for 6).
An object destined to be touched and held, the book itself has snakelike qualities. The corners are rounded, the cover is slippery and the embossed lettering is rendered in a very carefully chosen orange hue: “the same color as the two-headed snake that repulsed me at the project’s outset,” Strand says.
