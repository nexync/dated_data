One man was killed and nine others were shot early Sunday morning on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, a teeming tourist destination that was more crowded than usual after the conclusion of a major college football game.
In a news conference on Sunday, Michael S. Harrison, the city’s police superintendent, said the shooting had taken place just before 1:30 a.m. on the 100 block of Bourbon Street in the French Quarter.
“Shots rang out, we responded to it, we heard it,” he said.
The victims ranged in age from 20 to 37. Eight of the 10 victims were men and two were women. Information was not available early Sunday on the name of the deceased or on the condition of the other victims.
Emergency medical personnel were “less than half a block away” from the site of the shooting, according to the city’s mayor, Mitch Landrieu, who also spoke at the news conference.
“The violence just continues to spin out of control with people brandishing weapons whenever they think they can, and it’s really unfortunate,” Mr. Landrieu said.
The shooting occurred several hours after Grambling State beat Southern University, 52-30, in the Bayou Classic, the annual game that pits the two historically black universities against each other. Both schools are in Louisiana and their matchup tends to drive a significant number of tourists to New Orleans for the game, as well as for a parade and fan festival.
“It’s just a tragic end to what was otherwise a beautiful weekend,” Mr. Landrieu said of the shooting.
A manager at the Hard Rock Cafe on the 100 block of Bourbon Street said that she was not authorized to speak to a reporter and could not answer any questions. But she did say that the cafe had opened at 10 a.m., as usual, and that other restaurants and bars on the block were open, despite the shooting.
