PITTSBURGH — Robert Bowers, the man accused of murdering 11 people in a hate-fueled massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue, entered a plea of not guilty in a federal courtroom on Thursday.
Mr. Bowers, 46, walked into the courtroom on foot, showing little sign of the injuries he sustained from the shootout that ended the attack on Saturday, besides a heavily bandaged left elbow. He wore red, short-sleeved jailhouse scrubs and his handcuffs were unlocked at the defense table. He sat down with little effort.
Mr. Bowers leaned forward in his seat, firmly nodding his close-shaved head and answering “Yes,” loudly and without hesitation, to every question he was asked. Those questions included whether he was informed of and understood the charges and penalties.
“The possible penalties,” he was informed by Troy Rivetti, one of the prosecutors, “are first a sentence of death.” Mr. Bowers did not appear to flinch. Beyond death were a variety of prison sentences from 10 years to life, connected to the 44 counts.
At the end of the short hearing, Mr. Bowers was asked how he pleaded.
He also requested a jury trial, which prosecutors estimated could take three to four weeks, or longer if Attorney General Jeff Sessions certified it to be a capital case.
