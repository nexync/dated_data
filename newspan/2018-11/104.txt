“Song of Back and Neck” tells the story of a paralegal who has repressed so much frustration that his anger has manifested in the form of chronic back and neck pain. Only acupuncture helps. And the needles in his back don’t merely vibrate; they make music, a phenomenon that turns him into a celebrity in the Chinese-American community. Broad cultural stereotyping is just one example of this movie’s dreary sense of humor.
That pitiable situation notwithstanding, Fred becomes romantically involved with a client, Regan (Rosemarie DeWitt), who is oddly taken with Fred’s soft-spoken mewling and tone-deaf quips. Movies deserve artistic license when it comes to portraying couples, even when they seem mismatched in attractiveness and charm, but Fred’s behavior is so strange that his fling with Regan plays like directorial wish fulfillment.
The cognitive dissonance would be less of a problem if the movie were funny, but it isn’t. Lieberstein based it on his own experiences with back pain, with inspiration from the work of the physician John E. Sarno, whose ideas about the psychological underpinnings of pain are dismissed by much of the medical establishment. What Lieberstein has made is a self-help manual disguised as a comedy.
