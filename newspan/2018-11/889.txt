European culture suffered a massive disillusion during the conflict — no God, no beauty, no coherence, no meaning, just the cruel ironic joke of life. Cynicism breeds a kind of nihilism, a disbelief in all values, an assumption that others’ motives are bad. It makes it hard to see the good that remains.
Some of the disillusioned drop out of public life, since it’s all meaningless. But others want to burn it all down because it’s all rotten. Moderation is taken for cowardice. Aggression is regarded as courage. No conciliatory word is permitted when a fighting word will do.
At the end of the movie Dax returns to his barracks. His men have captured a pretty, innocent young German woman. She’s crying and terrified. 
Then they make her sing.  The men begin to quiet, then hum along, and then — thinking of home, of sweetness and humanity itself — they fall to weeping over what they’ve lost.
A little visitation of tenderness amid the fight.
