Joel Embiid put on a show with his father in the stands for the first time this season, collecting 26 points and 14 rebounds to lead the Philadelphia 76ers to a 117-91 win over the visiting Knicks on Wednesday night.
Embiid’s spin move into a one-handed jam earned a smile and applause from Thomas Embiid, a colonel in the Cameroon military who is visiting from the family’s home country and plans to spend a few weeks with his son. Growing up, Embiid had to persuade his father that basketball wasn’t a dangerous game and that he wouldn’t have to abide by Thomas’s wishes of becoming an elite volleyball player.
Embiid was aces against the Knicks, though. He had 17 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists in the first half alone. He finished with his league-best 21st double-double and helped the Sixers improve to 11-1 at home.
J.J. Redick hit four 3-pointers and scored 24 points, and Ben Simmons had 14 points. Jimmy Butler hit a 3 in the third to make it 86-58.
Enes Kanter and Mario Hezonja each scored 17 points for the Knicks. The Knicks have played nine of 12 games on the road and were coming off a 115-108 loss to Detroit on Tuesday.
It was Embiid’s 18th game of the season with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds, and he probably could have grabbed a seat with his father and relaxed in the fourth quarter. The Sixers emptied the bench and won for the sixth time in seven games.
JAZZ 101, NETS 91 Donovan Mitchell returned from a two-game absence with 29 points, taking over down the stretch and leading Utah to a victory in Brooklyn.
Mitchell showed no effects from the bruised ribs that had kept him out, scoring 12 points in the final 5 minutes 42 seconds to help Utah seize control of a close game.
Rudy Gobert had 23 points and 16 rebounds for the Jazz, who bounced back from a miserable performance in their last game without Mitchell, a 121-88 home loss to Indiana on Monday. They took a while to get going Wednesday but thrived at the end thanks to Mitchell, who scored mostly on drives into the lane and nailed a 3-pointer that made it 93-89.
Before the game, the Jazz agreed to acquire the veteran Kyle Korver from the Cleveland Cavaliers, according to multiple media reports. Utah entered the game ranked 29th in the N.B.A. in 3-point shooting, at 31.9 percent, and Korver should certainly improve that area.
Spencer Dinwiddie scored 18 points off the bench for the Nets, who dropped their season-high fourth straight game.
The Nets missed their first six shots and the Jazz their first five, and it took a while before either heated up. The Nets started 4 for 19 but trailed only 17-16 after one quarter.
