Election Day is finally upon us. As California — and the nation — awaits the results, here is what you need to know to follow the day’s events.
Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Californians voting on Election Day can find their polling place here, on the California Secretary of State’s website.
• Jose A. Del Real will be following congressional races in the Central Valley, particularly the 10th District contest between the Republican incumbent, Jeff Denham, and the Democratic challenger, Josh Harder. It’s a seat the Democrats have high hopes of flipping.
• Jennifer Medina will be in Orange County, where Democrats have targeted several seats long held by Republicans.
• Thomas Fuller will be in Los Angeles following the governor’s race, in which Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom has the edge in the polls against the Republican businessman John Cox.
• Tim Arango will be in San Diego, where critics say the indicted Republican incumbent Duncan Hunter has waged a campaign based on fear and racist undertones against his challenger, Ammar Campa-Najjar.
• Adam Nagourney, our Los Angeles bureau chief, will be in New York, lending his political expertise to our national coverage.
• In the governor’s race, we profiled Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox.
• For a look at the Latino electorate, and how it could factor into the results, read this article from the Central Valley and Nevada.
• We profiled Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic voice of moderation in a state swinging farther to the left, who is most likely running her last campaign.
• Over the weekend, we published an in-depth look at the congressional races in Orange County that could help Democrats seize control of the House.
• And earlier in the campaign, we published a deep look at the corruption scandal that has engulfed Mr. Hunter.
As day turns to night and the polls close, don’t expect results right away. We may know who won the governor’s race early — Mr. Newsom is comfortably ahead — but be prepared to wait for the outcome in the tight House races in Orange County and the Central Valley. California typically takes a long time to count votes, partly because residents can send mail-in votes through Election Day.
Mark Baldassare, the president and chief executive of the Public Policy Institute of California, said the state had a history of being “very, very slow” in counting ballots. “Don’t be surprised if we don’t have definitive answers on election night,” he said.
• The Los Angeles Times endorses Ms. Feinstein for Senate and Mr. Newsom for governor, citing their experience and understanding of California’s policy challenges. The paper supports Propositions 1, 2 and 10, which address housing issues by financing mortgages, funding supportive housing for the mentally ill and ending rent-control restrictions. See the full list of endorsements here.
• The San Francisco Chronicle also recommends Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom and supports Propositions 1 and 2. Its editorial board is against Proposition 10, saying the measure would “entrust another vast swath of housing policy to the very same officials — and probably yield similar results.” See the full list of endorsements here.
• The Sacramento Bee picks Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom and supports Propositions 1, 2 and 10. It also recommends voting against Proposition 7, which would repeal Daylight Saving Time: “California doesn’t have time for this.” See the full list of endorsements here.
• The Mercury News also supports Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom. Read its editorials and see the full list of endorsements — including regional measures and choices for Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara Counties — here.
• The Orange County Register recommends Mr. Cox for governor, saying the state’s growing inequality and affordability should be addressed by Mr. Cox, a successful businessman. See its endorsements here.
• The San Diego Union-Tribune endorses Ms. Feinstein, Mr. Newsom and Mr. Campa-Najjar, the 29-year-old Mexican-Palestinian-American Democrat who is challenging Mr. Hunter, who was indicted this year on fraud charges and campaign finance violations. See the full list of endorsements here.
• The Fresno Bee recommends Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom because of their grasp of policies that affect the Central Valley in particular. Ms. Feinstein “understands Valley water issues and has worked across the aisle to steer more water to farmers,” The Bee’s editorial notes. See the full list of endorsements here.
• The Tribune in San Luis Obispo supports Ms. Feinstein and Mr. Newsom, and like most other papers, advises against Proposition 6, which would repeal the state gas tax increase. See the full list of endorsements here and recommendations on the 11 statewide propositions here.
