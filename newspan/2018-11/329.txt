As America heads into the long Thanksgiving weekend, let’s pause a moment to express our gratitude for books and the people who write them. We’ve got some good recommendations this week, anchored by a number of smart genre novels: a serial killer (“My Sister, the Serial Killer,” by Oyinkan Braithwaite), a feral detective (“The Feral Detective,” by Jonathan Lethem), a Japanese Sherlock Holmes (“Newcomer,” by Keigo Higashino). There’s also poetry and dystopia and history and science, and a couple of takes on the state of American Judaism — something for everyone, even your angry Uncle Bot. Happy reading, and enjoy the holiday.
