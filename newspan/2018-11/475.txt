Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain obtained the approval of the other 27 European Union members on a formal divorce pact from the bloc on Sunday. Now she must get approval for the deal in the British Parliament.
Today marks the culmination of our exit negotiations with the E.U. But it also marks the start of a crucial national debate in our country over the next few weeks. Before Christmas, M.P.s will vote on this deal. It will be one of the most significant votes that Parliament has held for many years. On it will depend whether we move forward together into a brighter future, or open the door to yet more division and uncertainty. The British people don’t want to spend any more time arguing about Brexit. They want a good deal done that fulfils the vote and allows us to come together again as a country. So I will take this deal back to the House of Commons, confident we have achieved the best deal available and full of optimism about the future of our country. In Parliament and beyond it, I will make the case for this deal with all my heart, and I look forward to that campaign.
BRUSSELS — More than four decades after Britain tied itself to its Continental neighbors, Prime Minister Theresa May obtained the approval of the other 27 European Union members on a formal divorce pact from the bloc, a consequential step intended to take the country on a new, if unclear, path.
