This 20-foot-high single-story Tudor-style building, on a main commercial strip, is occupied by an HSBC bank with a triple net lease running until August. The site, with 50 feet of frontage and 2,500 square feet below grade, was home to a White Tower fast-food restaurant from the mid-1930s until 1971, and four years later was converted into the Williamsburg Savings Bank. The 6,500-square-foot property, which offers 19,500 square feet in air rights and 26,000 buildable square feet, is in an “opportunity zone,” offering a buyer a potential break on capital-gains taxes.
A private investor has bought this 12,349-square-foot building in the Hudson Square area to satisfy a 1031 exchange, which allows the investor to defer capital gains from the sale of another property in Upper Manhattan. The five-story building has 19 apartments: eight one-bedrooms, nine two-bedrooms, one four-bedroom and one five-bedroom. Five apartments are rent stabilized with rents averaging $1,074 a month, two are rent controlled with rents averaging $124 a month, and 12 are market rate with rents averaging $4,928 a month. All market-rate apartments have been renovated and feature granite countertops, hardwood floors and exposed brick walls. The building sold for about 15.4 times the rent roll, with a cap rate of 4.33 percent.
Jackson, a handbag designer and manufacturer, has signed a lease for five years and one month for a 5,357-square-foot office and showroom space on the second floor of this 12-story 1914 building in the garment district. The company plans to move into the space, which has 14-foot ceilings and picture windows, on Dec. 1. The previous tenant, Underboss, a lingerie, lounge and sleepwear company, moved to the sixth floor.
