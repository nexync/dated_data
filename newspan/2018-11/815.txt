A 10- to 15-year lease is available for a 1,400-square-foot retail space, with 18-foot ceilings, in this five-story neo-Federal-style mixed-use townhouse in the Lenox Hill section of the Upper East Side Historic District. The 1872 building was originally designed in the neo-Greco style by the D. & J. Jardine architecture firm. Robert Clergerie, a French shoe designer, had a shop there until moving to 901 Madison Avenue last year, and Hermès, the French luxury goods store, is next door.
A hotel management company has signed a seven-year, three-month lease for a 7,806-square-foot office space on the fifth floor of this 12-story 1920 building. The space, which features 100 feet of windows overlooking Bryant Park, was previously occupied by Sharp Entertainment, which is now leasing the sixth and seventh floors.
A multifamily-building operator has bought this 1927 six-story elevator building with 35 rent-stabilized apartments — 17 one-bedrooms and 18 two-bedrooms. The building was delivered at 100 percent occupancy, with rents averaging $1,275 a month. It offered a 3.01 percent cap rate.
