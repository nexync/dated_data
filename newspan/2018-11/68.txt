I can’t say what Breton would have made of “Miss Dalí,” written and directed by Ventura Pons. But as far as I’m concerned, this biographical treatment of Salvador Dalí’s sister Anna Maria is one of the most peculiarly disorienting movies I’ve seen in some time.
Nearly three hours long, it begins in 1989, after the death of Dalí that year and before the death of Anna Maria just four months later. In her home in Spain, elderly Anna Maria, played by the Welsh actress Sian Phillips, receives Maggie, a friend from her time at Cambridge University, played by Claire Bloom.
The two reminisce about Anna Maria’s life with her brother in the early 20th century. Their dialogue is bald, constant exposition. Discussing Dalí’s first trip to Paris, Anna Maria says, “He really wanted to see the Louvre.” Maggie responds enthusiastically, “It’s the mecca for young painters,” before observing, “Paris: City of Lights!” Wow.
Flashbacks featuring Dalí (played, from his teen years on, by Joan Carreras, who looks fully his 50-plus years throughout) have a similar rudimentary quality. Relentless, spell-it-all-out dialogue is wedded to a clunky visual approach that’s pretty much the cinema equivalent of a wikiHow entry. The filmmakers seem to have not been able to obtain permission to depict any of Dalí’s actual work, so all that “genius” we hear discussed is never visible. Which seems appropriate.
