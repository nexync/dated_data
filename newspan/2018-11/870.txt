Readers respond to a column by Bret Stephens about Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants.
Bret Stephens opens his Nov. 17 column, “Plato Foresaw the Folly of Facebook,” with the parable about the pharaoh Thamus rebuffing the god Theuth’s invention of written words because they “‘give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth.’” It is a story from Plato’s “Phaedrus,” attributed to Socrates.
“Welcome to Facebook,” Mr. Stephens writes, suggesting that Thamus’s stance is the correct one.
But I’ve always taken a different interpretation of the tale.

Thamus was wrong: Writing didn’t ruin knowledge. It proved instead to be “the art preservative of all arts.” Indeed the parable is self-refuting: The only reason anyone is able to remember it these 2,000-plus years later is that these words were written down.
Bret Stephens finds Socrates’ words “apposite again” as he criticizes Facebook’s “cynical and self-serving calculations as it tried to brazen its way through a year of serial P.R. disasters,” including Russian disinformation and Cambridge Analytica.
That criticism is well deserved. But Russian robot trolls and slimy lobbyists are not Facebook’s fundamental problem. The inherent, founding contradiction of Facebook is that it has to compromise the privacy of its users to make money. There’s no fixing that with its current model.
Bret Stephens’s column sure hit the “sweet spot” — what a cerebral tour de force, using two of the big three thinkers from ancient Greece, Plato and Socrates, to put a laserlike focus on a huge 21st-century problem.
I do think, however, that Mr. Stephens might have woven the third, Aristotle, into his recommendation for how Facebook’s senior leadership could benefit by chilling out for a weekend and reading “an ancient book”: How about discussing “Nicomachean Ethics” over some wine and cheese? You know, really learning something.
