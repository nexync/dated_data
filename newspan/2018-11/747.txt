Doctors Weigh In on Gun Control. Will Congress?
Readers say the time to act is now.
It should be no surprise that doctors are calling gun violence a public health crisis or that the National Rifle Association has scorned them for doing so.
The medical community has been commenting and reporting on gun violence for more than a century. The Journal of the American Medical Association in the early 1900s decried reckless use of weapons during Fourth of July celebrations, for example.
The American Journal of Public Health as early as the 1910s published gun crime and suicide data. In the 1920s and ’30s, the journal noted how localities with weaker gun laws, as well as the country as a whole, experienced more gun violence than their peers.
In our own time, the N.R.A. has not only stymied federal research into gun violence but has also blacklisted medical groups for being “anti-gun,” opposed the nomination of Vivek Murthy as surgeon general, and backed a Florida law that prevented doctors from engaging patients about gun ownership.
If doctors are to “stay in their lane,” as the N.R.A. demands, the N.R.A. should stay off the road entirely.
“Will Congress Toughen Gun Laws?” (editorial, Nov. 9) points out that the circumstances now exist for Congress to put in place sensible gun safety measures. It seems obvious to me that when the Parkland students’ generation comes into power (and into Congress) such measures will inevitably be enacted. But why wait until then?
