Vijay Singh settled his lawsuit against the PGA Tour over how it investigated his use of deer antler spray, ending more than five years of litigation less than a week before the case was to go to trial in New York.
Terms of the settlement announced Tuesday were not disclosed, and are covered by a confidentiality agreement.
“I’m very happy for Vijay that the matter has been resolved,” said Jeffrey Rosenblum, one of his lawyers. The PGA Tour said in a statement that the settlement reflected a mutual commitment to move forward.
Singh was about to turn 50 when he said in a Sports Illustrated article at the start of 2013 that he used deer antler spray, which was said to include an insulin-growth factor that was on the tour’s list of banned substances.
The tour sent a sample from Singh to be tested; it returned small amounts of IGF-1. Under the tour’s policy, admission of using a banned substance is a violation even without a test. The tour told him on Feb. 19, 2013, that he would be suspended for three months. Two months later, the tour dropped its case. The next week, Singh sued the tour, claiming “public humiliation and ridicule” from the 12-week investigation.
Singh, 55, has won 34 times on the PGA Tour, including three majors, and was inducted into the Hall of Fame. He ended the PGA Tour Champions season a week ago by shooting 61 in the final round to win the Charles Schwab Cup Championship.
