Republicans moved toward expanding their control of the Senate as Democrats took power in the House, with incomplete election results pointing toward a reaffirmation of a deeply divided nation.
The Republicans flipped seats in three states — Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota — that President Trump had won by a large margin in 2016, and won an open seat in Tennessee. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas held off a surprisingly strong challenge from Beto O’Rourke.
Money and momentum favored the Democrats, who seized more than a dozen of the 23 seats they needed to take the House in early returns. Democrats faced mixed results in the governor’s races, picking up governorships in Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico and Wisconsin, but failing to claim the coveted battleground of Florida.
The returns provided fresh evidence of the partisan split in American political life with Democrats seizing Republican House seats in suburban districts where affluent educated voters had been vocal in their opposition to Mr. Trump.
Democrats Won the House. Here’s What’s Next.
The Democrats took control of the House of Representatives, adding several women to their ranks. The party now has the power to investigate President Trump. Here’s how else Democrats may challenge the president.
[cheers] The Democrats have won control of the House. “We want our community back. We want our country back. And we want our state back.” “Change came tonight.” “We are standing in our power.” “A victory for our country.” Here are some of the new faces: “People like us, with unique names and different backgrounds.” “There’s never been a Native American woman.” “When we vote, this is what happens.” But what comes next? For starters, a lot of potential Donald Trump-related investigations. Democrats will now take control of House committees. That gives them the power to launch investigations and issue subpoenas. The people most likely overseeing some of these committees: They include many Trump foes.  He stiffs everybody. You can’t trust him. That’s what I’ve learned.” This is Representative Jerrold Nadler, a New Yorker who’s been feuding with Trump since the 1990s, when he tried to block one of Trump’s real estate projects. As the likely new head of the Judiciary Committee, Nadler has promised he will open investigations into Trump’s alleged interference with the F.B.I. and Justice Department. Another Trump nemesis is Representative Maxine Waters of California. “Maxine, a seriously low I.Q. person.” “This president has displayed the most despicable behavior that any human being could do.” She will now likely oversee the Financial Services Committee and may try to reinstate consumer protections rolled back by Republicans. Representative Elijah Cummings has promised to look into accusations of voter suppression and potential fraud and abuse by the White House and federal agencies. And then there’s Representative Adam Schiff, who said he’d reopen targeted inquiries into alleged ties between Trump and Russia. “We’ll be able to get answers the Republicans were unwilling to pursue.” So, what’s on the agenda? House Democrats have promised to make fighting climate change a priority and tackle gerrymandering. “A set of maps that distorts public sentiment.” They may try to team up with with Republicans on infrastructure spending and lowering prescription drug costs. “We’re going to work to drive down health care costs, strengthen the Affordable Care Act and dramatically reduce the cost of prescription drugs.” But getting buy-in on their legislative agenda from the Republican-controlled Senate would be a tall order on many issues. What about impeaching Trump? It’s not the party line — for now. “Impeachment is a very divisive approach.” They’d also need the Senate’s help. But Democratic House members may be able to get a hold of Trump’s tax returns, using an obscure 100-year-old precedent. And the leadership? Nancy Pelosi, the current Democratic leader, will be up for re-election in December. But there are others who may be interested in the job and many who want her out. “It’s time for people to know when to go.” “Will you vote for Nancy Pelosi?” “Probably not.” “I don’t support Nancy Pelosi.” So, when do they start? The 116th House of Representatives will be sworn in on Jan. 3, 2019.
Democrats won control of the House, a significant victory for a party locked out of power since the 2016 elections.
The Democratic win means a deadlocked Congress — with Republicans in control of the Senate and Democrats in the lower chamber — and is a setback for the Trump administration, which is likely to face an onslaught of congressional investigations. Even before the election, House Democrats had begun preparing a flurry of hearings, subpoenas and inquiries into nearly every aspect of the president and his White House.
While Democrats were favored to win back the House, their victory was far from assured.

The special election for the Mississippi Senate advanced to a runoff between Cindy Hyde-Smith, a Republican, and Mike Espy, a Democrat, according to The Associated Press.
The state uses a so-called jungle primary system, where if no candidate reaches a 50 percent threshold, the top two vote-getters face each other in a runoff election. Neither Ms. Hyde-Smith, who was appointed to fill Senator Thad Cochran’s seat, nor Mr. Espy broke that bar. Chris McDaniel, a conservative, failed to make the cutoff.
Their runoff is scheduled for Nov. 27.
Candidates weren’t the only things on the ballot on Tuesday night. Voters weighed in on more than 150 ballot initiatives.
• Florida restored voting rights to 1.5 million people who had been convicted of felonies but had completed their sentences. The new voters could change the political dynamics for the 2020 race in the perennial battleground state.
• Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum that would have repealed a 2016 law preventing discrimination based on gender identity in public spaces, including bathrooms.
• Missouri voters legalized medical marijuana while North Dakota voters decided not to legalize recreational marijuana.
• Voters in Arkansas and Missouri raised the minimum wage. In Missouri, the wage will rise to $11 from $8.50; Arkansas’s will increase to $12 from $7.85.

Two and a half hours after the polls were scheduled to close in Nevada, people were still waiting in line to vote.
The Elections Division of the Nevada secretary of state’s office said it would not release results from anywhere in the state until the last voter cast a ballot.
At 7:43 p.m. local time, well past the scheduled closing time of 7, voters were still waiting in Clark, Elko, Lyon and Washoe Counties. Elko finished by 8:13; Lyon by 9:16. Clark — the state’s largest county, home to Las Vegas and Henderson — wrapped things up by 9:21. But in Washoe County, home to Reno, the doors did not close until around 10 p.m., when the final voters were done.
When the ballots were counted, Jacky Rosen defeated Senator Dean Heller.
Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 presidential candidate, won the Utah Senate race, according to The Associated Press.
Mr. Romney defeated Jenny Wilson, the Democrat, in his largely uncompetitive race. Moderate Republicans hope he’ll be a check on the president, given his vocal criticism of Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign. Read more about why he ran here.
The returns mean a number of historic firsts. Voters chose from a set of candidates that was among the most diverse ever to run in the United States.
Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat in Massachusetts, will become the first African-American woman to represent the state in Congress after winning her race, according to The Associated Press. She beat a 10-term Democratic incumbent in her primary and vowed to pursue “activist leadership” to advance a progressive agenda.
Jared Polis, a wealthy Democratic congressman in Colorado, became the first openly gay man elected as governor in any state after he won his contest, according to The Associated Press. He wants to push for single-payer health care and renewable energy.
Ilhan Omar, a Democratic state legislator in Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib, a former Democratic state legislator in Michigan, became the first Muslim women elected to Congress after winning their House races, according to The Associated Press.
Ms. Tlaib, a Palestinian-American attorney, has championed Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage and abolishing the government agency known as ICE.
Sharice Davids, a Democrat and former White House fellow from Kansas, and Deb Haaland, a Democratic community activist from New Mexico, became the first Native American women voted in to the House after winning their races, according to The Associated Press.
In her contest, Ms. Haaland drew parallels between the separation of Native American children and the federal government’s recent border actions.
Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, will be Tennessee’s first female senator after defeating her opponent, according to The Associated Press. She is anti-abortion, and stressed border security and taxes.
Marsha Blackburn thanked President Trump after she won her race, making her the first woman in Tennessee to become a senator.
Thank you for believing in me and for hearing our message and for giving me your vote. And for allowing me to be the first woman ever elected to the Senate from Tennessee. [cheers] And — And just imagine this: It is a conservative woman to boot! [cheers] I want to say a special thank you to the president and to the vice president for the support.
In one of the most surprising upsets of the night, Kendra Horn, a Democrat, defeated the Republican incumbent Steve Russell in Oklahoma’s Fifth District, which includes Oklahoma City. The victory came in a state that is one of the reddest in the country. President Trump won by 36 points two years ago, and Republicans had held — until now — every congressional seat.
But there have been signs of discontent. A plunge in oil prices matched with years of tax-slashing led to school districts going to four-day weeks and rural hospitals shutting down. The Republican governor, Mary Fallin, has low approval ratings.
All of this has led to some backlash. Discontent has especially risen in cities, once the homeland of Oklahoma Republicans. Democrats this summer won several statehouse special selections in Republican-held districts around Tulsa and Oklahoma City. Ms. Horn significantly outraised her opponent. Still, few expected Ms. Horn, who has a background working for nonprofits and in the aerospace industry, to win.
