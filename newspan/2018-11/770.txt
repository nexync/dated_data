I can’t stop thinking about this interview Vanity Fair did with Billie Eilish, asking her the same questions they did a year ago, and editing her answers side by side. The past year saw the now-16-year-old’s music explode in popularity. Seeing both how her life has changed and how she looks back at her younger self is a very stark portrait of how sudden fame and attention can feel.
There have been hip-hop beefs since time immemorial, but now stars can use so many more platforms to get their points across. Cardi B and Nicki Minaj have been leveraging them all — Instagram, internet radio, Twitter — and the rivalry between Drake and Pusha T hasn’t been confined to music, either. Jon Caramanica breaks down how the landscape is changing.
Get ready for everyone to start asking you if you’ve seen “Breaking Bad” again. The show’s creator, Vince Gilligan, is writing the script for a two-hour spinoff film, The Hollywood Reporter writes, although it’s not clear if it will be shown on TV or get a theatrical release.
Bob Dylan’s “Blood on the Tracks” is the focus of his latest Bootleg Series box set, called “More Blood, More Tracks,” and I applaud whoever made that decision. The set “unveils all of the initial sessions,” writes the pop music critic Jon Pareles, as well as “Up to Me,” a song that Dylan wrote for the album but didn’t include. Over at The Ringer, Steven Hyden imagines how the track could fit into Luca Guadagnino’s upcoming movie adaptation of the album.
