Zhouqin Burnikel helps us prepare for a holiday.
TUESDAY PUZZLE — An enthusiastic welcome back to Zhouqin Burnikel, who has not been seen here since September. I always enjoy Ms. Burnikel’s puzzles, and she has certainly shown that she can handle making crosswords for any day of the week.
The United States celebrates Thanksgiving on Thursday, so Ms. Burnikel offers us a theme that will get our cooking off to a good start. I have an extra day to prepare because my family celebrates on Friday — we call it Second Thanksgiving — just to be different. (Not really; it’s because we’re a blended family.) But I certainly get started on side dishes days before to break the cooking marathon up a bit. Our friends at NYT Cooking have prepared an amazing guide with tons of mouthwatering recipes for us, and I can highly recommend these Pecan Pie Truffles as a dessert that will disappear the moment you put them on the table.
Oh, right, the puzzle. One of the things I really like about Ms. Burnikel’s crosswords is the way she makes us think about how English is used. It’s not Ms. Burnikel’s native language, so I can only imagine her view on how confusing it is that we tend to use the same word for many different things.
16A: Hi, kids! This is a tricky one for two reasons. First, you have to recognize that this is a veiled capital clue (the first word “Bud” is capitalized not only because it’s the first word in the sentence, but also because it’s a proper name). Second, you have to be aware of the comedy duo Abbott and Costello, which was popular in the 1930s through the 1950s. Bud Abbott (primarily the straight man) and Lou Costello were the team responsible for bringing you the famous “Who’s on First?” routine. Talk about playing with words!
Ms. Burnikel offers us four different ways in which the word “turkey” might be used. It appears in her puzzle as the bird, the recipient of an award for flops, three strikes bowled in a row and as the name of a Eurasian country.
