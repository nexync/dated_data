A reader is heartened that some candidates are campaigning on gun control issues.
It was incredibly heartening in this political climate to read “Not Afraid to Claim an F From the N.R.A.” (news article, Nov. 5). As a lifelong Democrat and a physician, I have found it frustrating to watch candidates waffle over gun laws, when guns are responsible for so many more American deaths than more heavily restricted and legislated activities like air travel.
I would ask that we take this momentum one step further and support repealing the Dickey Amendment, which restricts federal funding for research on gun violence. Knowledge truly is power, and federal funding for an issue of such great public health importance is critical if we want to discover effective interventions to reduce gun violence.
We should all stand behind evidence-based and scientifically sound research meant to save American lives.
