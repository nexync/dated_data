When they married last March, Melisa and Justin Monempour stood under an elaborate huppah, which included a 10-by-12-foot flower wall drenched in white roses, hydrangeas and orchids.
The couple’s huppah served two roles. First, as an important part of the ceremony, symbolizing in the Jewish faith the home the couple would build together. And second, as a photo backdrop, once it was relocated to the ballroom at the Langham hotel in Pasadena, Calif., for their 450 reception guests.
Huppahs, which are canopies that are open on all sides, have been evolving over the years in Jewish ceremonies.
Similar to choosing the wedding site, florist or the couple’s attire, huppahs have become another form of self-expression and personal style, said Andrea Cohen, the owner of Chuppah Studio in Los Angeles. Ms. Cohen’s company services about 70 weddings a year, offering rentals and custom-made huppahs.
Smashing the Glass, a blog dedicated to helping couples plan their Jewish and “Jew-ish” weddings, has highlighted a variety of ceremony and reception ideas since its 2013 inception.
Karen Cinnamon, the site’s London-based founder and editor, regularly features artistic and beautifully arranged wedding canopies, including huppahs made of driftwood in Corsica, France; grapevines in Healdsburg, Calif.; and antique books as pillars with hundreds of light bulbs overhead at the New York Public Library in New York City.
Costs can run from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. Ellen Adelsberg, the owner of Parties by Ellen, who oversees eight to 10 weddings annually in the New York City area, South Florida and Israel, says she has planned ceremonies with huppahs totaling $25,000 to $30,000. Some have taken 12 hours, and up to 30 people, to construct.
Despite the investment of money, manpower and time, huppahs may ultimately be a surprise for a couple.
