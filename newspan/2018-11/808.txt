It poured in New York on Election Day, and the “I VOTED” sticker on Patricia Ione Lloyd’s coat that afternoon looked bedraggled. But her glittery eye shadow was perfection, utterly in keeping with the image of a woman whose Instagram posts include a photo of herself (taken just for fun) as a mermaid, in beaded bustier and glistening tail.
Ms. Lloyd is a big fan of glamour. She’s also political, and the characters in “Eve’s Song” — her professional playwriting debut, running through Dec. 9 at the Public Theater — are acutely aware of the images they project. She wrote the first draft in 2015 in the Public’s Emerging Writers Group, a program she’d tried for five years to get into, and which she credits with making possible the television writing she has done since.
With a black family at its center and the Ellis Wilson painting “Funeral Procession” on their wall, the play — an urgent, darkly comic reminder that black women’s lives matter, too — reads partly as a deconstruction of “The Cosby Show.” It would be reasonable to guess that its author grew up well-off.
But the story Ms. Lloyd tells of her Iowa childhood is about living under the poverty line. She goes by Ione now, but she was Patti then — a girl whose mother took her to yard sales to buy loads of books for very little, and whose father made up tales with her about what the birds outside were saying.
It was a long road from that life to the one she lives now, in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, with her partner, Samantha Ifill, a dentist. “Eve’s Song” came from Ms. Lloyd’s realization that joining a more privileged class didn’t guarantee safety from the dangers of being female, black and queer.
Upstairs at the Public, Ms. Lloyd — who is bubbly and funny, with a voice like Mindy Kaling’s — took out her smartphone, opened up Instagram and chatted about her feed. These are edited excerpts.
