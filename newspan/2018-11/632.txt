Everyone Is Talking About the California Wildfires. Read These Books on How to Fight Them.
So far, 48 people have died in California (and the toll is expected to rise) as a result of the deadliest wildfires in its history. Here are three books to read for more information on what is being done to stop wildfires and what it takes to fight them.
In the early 1900s, following a particularly deadly wildfire, the United States Forest Service cracked down on fires, extinguishing them no matter how small they were. As a result, much of the vegetation that might otherwise have been cleaned by naturally occurring blazes piled up, making subsequent fires that much more deadly. And now it’s a business: About 40 percent of America’s wildfire-fighting resources (helicopters that can cost as much as $7,000 an hour, for instance) are provided by private companies. Kodas discusses this and more in “fluid prose” and with “an eye for ghoulish detail,” wrote our reviewer.
This memoir by a smokejumper, the aerial firefighters deployed to fight remote forest fires, is “not surprisingly, filled with adventure, danger and tragedy,” according to our reviewer. The book takes place over the 1991 jumping season, and recounts the litany of injuries Taylor sustained, as well as details about his job, including run-ins with bears or the digging of fire lines. Occasionally, details of the writer’s life (like his divorce) also seep through.
