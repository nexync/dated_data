Stephen Colbert sharply criticized Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, for circulating a doctored video on Thursday showing Jim Acosta of CNN refusing to give up the mic to a White House intern at a news conference.
The video was sped up, creating the illusion that Acosta had pushed the female intern roughly. This manipulated clip had originally been shared by Paul Joseph Watson, who makes conspiracy-theory videos for the far-right website Infowars.
Huckabee Sanders used the video clip to help justify the White House’s decision to revoke Acosta’s press pass. Colbert said this was enough to warrant Huckabee Sanders stepping down.
Jimmy Kimmel criticized the Trump administration for naming Matthew Whitaker acting attorney general, after the ouster of Jeff Sessions.
Kimmel played video of Whitaker in a previous job, working for a company that sold hot tubs. Then he revealed a crucial fact about the company — one that, Kimmel said, should disqualify Whitaker from becoming the nation’s top law-enforcement official.
Colbert turned his attention back to the Georgia governor’s race, which is still undecided — and could be headed for a runoff, if a few thousand uncounted ballots break hard in favor of the Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams.
