WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether a 40-foot cross on state property in suburban Maryland violates the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion.
A separate petition from state officials, referring to the monument as the Peace Cross, said the appeals court had committed a disturbing error.
In a brief urging the justices to deny review, the challengers said the memorial honors only Christian veterans, not all of whom welcome the use of a cross in this context.
In the Supreme Court’s last encounter with a war memorial in the form of a cross, the justices expressed varying views about the meaning of that symbol in a fractured decision that resolved very little.
Justice Scalia died in 2016, Justice Stevens retired in 2010 and Justice Kennedy stepped down in July. But there is little reason to think their replacements will be any less divided on the issues presented in the new cases, American Legion v. American Humanist Organization, No. 17-1717, and Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. American Humanist Association, No. 18-18.
