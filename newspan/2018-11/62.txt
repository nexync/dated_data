How Long Can People Live?
Some scientists hope one day to treat all of them at once — by targeting aging itself.
Humans aren’t built to last forever. The oldest person on record was Jeanne Calment, a Frenchwoman, who died in 1997 at the age of 122. In 2040, the average life span for people in Spain, projected to pass Japan as the country with the longest-lived citizens, will reach about 86 years.
In an essay in the journal JAMA last month, Tamara Tchkonia and Dr. James L. Kirkland of the Mayo Clinic categorized these processes into four broad groups: chronic inflammation; cell dysfunction; changes in stem cells that make them fail to regenerate tissue; and cellular senescence, the accumulation in tissue of aging cells that accompanies disease.
Healthy young people have few of these aging cells, but after age 60, they begin to accumulate, and their increasing quantity correlates with disabilities of old age.
Some drugs already approved for other purposes are being tested as “senolytics,” as the drugs that kill old cells are now called.
If drugs can treat aging, is aging itself a disease? No, Dr. Barzilai said.
Another drug candidate involves a coenzyme called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or N.A.D. It functions in cell respiration, moving electrons into the mitochondria where energy is produced.
As people age, levels of N.A.D. decline to the point where it is undetectable in the blood of the elderly.
