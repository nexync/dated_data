A 10- to 15-year lease is available for the entire ninth floor in this 12-story 1911 Midtown West building, which has a doorman, two lobbies, three passenger elevators and a freight elevator. The 12,965-square-foot space has five glass-enclosed offices, exposed brick walls, polished concrete floors, a new heating and air-conditioning system, and a new kitchen.
A developer, mainly of condominiums, has bought this 1931 two-story limestone building, originally a bank, on the southeast corner. Over the last 30 years, Body Reserve Gym had occupied the building, which still has vestiges of its banking days — a vault in the basement, marble floors and 25-foot ceilings. The 5,559-square-foot building offers 12,000 buildable square feet, which could be two or three floors of condominiums and commercial space on the lower levels.
Gleason’s Tavern, a bar and restaurant to open early next year, has signed a 10-year lease for 3,200 square feet — 2,000 on the ground floor and 1,200 on the second level — in this six-story mixed-use building across 58th Street from the Time Warner Center in the Columbus Circle area. The space, formerly occupied by the Coliseum Bar & Restaurant, has a 1,500-square-foot storage basement and can accommodate 150 seats. The tavern has another location at Hotel Shocard in the Times Square area.
