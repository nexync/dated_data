There are few film production companies in the United States as admirable as Kartemquin Films, the nonprofit documentary house founded in Chicago in 1966 that was subsequently responsible for such outstanding, illuminating works as “Hoop Dreams” (1994), “The Interrupters” (2010) and “Abacus: Small Enough to Jail” (2016).
A preview of the film.
Shot in a rudimentary but pleasingly grainy black-and-white, with hypnotic organ music from Philip Glass (his first credited feature-length film score), this hourlong picture is a delight. First, it’s a thought-provoking time capsule. A lot of interviewees say the war in Vietnam makes them less happy than they’d otherwise be, which made this viewer wonder why the various conflicts the United States is involved in today seem so much less talked-about.
The movie contains some pop-culture surprises: One of the interviewees is Lincoln Perry, known as the performer Stepin Fetchit, who says with sincerity that daily Communion is his main source of happiness.
Besides being an inquiry into philosophical clarity and befuddlement, the documentary is an engaging portrait of its two hosts and, more indirectly, of the filmmakers guiding them.
