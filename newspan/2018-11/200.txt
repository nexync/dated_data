Welcome to At War, a weekly newsletter about the experiences and costs of war with stories from Times reporters and outside voices.
The New York Timesâ€™s At War blog ran from 2009 to 2016, with a small but passionate following and a diehard group of regular contributors. In March 2018, it returned under the helm of The New York Times Magazine.
Each week, the newsletter highlights original stories published by the At War team and guest contributors. It also provides readers with a roundup of the latest news from the Times related to conflict and consequence.
