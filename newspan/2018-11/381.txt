Freddie Hart, who had a run of No. 1 country hits in the early 1970s and won numerous awards for his smash “Easy Loving,” died on Saturday in Burbank, Calif. He was 91.
His website announced his death.
Mr. Hart’s career encompassed several eras of country music. He began his recording career as a California honky-tonker in the early 1950s but did not break through until 1971, when “Easy Loving,” with its slicker “Nashville sound,” made him a star in his mid-40s.
Mr. Hart also wrote songs for Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Buck Owens, George Jones, Waylon Jennings and dozens of others. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004.
At the 1972 Academy of Country Music Awards, he managed a sweep of all five categories he was nominated for: best single and song for “Easy Loving,” best album for the LP of the same name, best male vocalist and entertainer of the year. In all these categories, he beat out competitors like Merle Haggard, Conway Twitty, Marty Robbins and Charley Pride.
Mr. Hart’s last country Top 10 hit was in 1977, and his last song to reach the Top 40 was in 1981. But he continued to record and tour around the world into his 90s.
He was born Frederick Segrest on Dec. 21, 1926, in Lochopoka, Ala., and became the self-described “black sheep” of 15 children in a sharecropper’s family. He first ran away from home at 7, was sent off by his parents to a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at 12 and, like many of his generation, lied about his age to get into the military — at 14. After joining the Marine Corps, he served in Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Guam.
Mr. Hart’s survivors include his wife of 61 years, Ginger, and four sons, Freddie Jr., Andy, Joe and Victor.
