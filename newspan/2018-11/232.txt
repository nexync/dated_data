Lindsey Vonn can’t bring herself to say goodbye to ski racing without one final run at her favorite course, so she intends to extend her farewell tour into next season.
Vonn, who has won more World Cup races than any other woman, announced on her YouTube channel Friday that she planned to come back for one more series of speed races at Lake Louise, Alberta, next season.
Her firm retirement plans changed when she hyperextended and sprained a ligament in her knee during a training crash on Nov. 19. She posted video of the crash in which she fell on a turn, did the splits and went into the protective fence. She also sustained a bone bruise.
That wipeout forced her skip the speed events this weekend in Lake Louise, which she has dominated so often that her fans playfully call it “Lake Lindsey.” Vonn has 18 career World Cup wins at the venue.
Vonn has not announced a timetable for her return to the circuit this season. She expressed her frustration in sitting out two downhill races and a super-G race at Lake Louise.
Vonn, 34, has 82 World Cup victories, leaving her five away from breaking the record held by Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden.
Over her career, Vonn’s had a long list of ailments: knee-ligament reconstructions, fractures near her left knee joint, a bruised shin, a broken ankle, a broken arm, a sliced right thumb and countless concussions. She missed the 2014 Sochi Olympics because of an injury to her right knee.
Her latest crash happened at the U.S. ski team’s speed center in Copper Mountain, Colo. She was cruising down the course when she slid out.
“I don’t have a lot of fight left in me,” Vonn said. “I’ve had a lot of surgeries. I’ve had a lot of injuries, a lot of setbacks. But I’m also not a quitter.
