FRIDAY (1995) 6 p.m. on BET. Twenty years before directing the N.W.A biopic “Straight Outta Compton,” the director F. Gary Gray directed the actual former N.W.A rapper Ice Cube in this stoner buddy comedy, probably best remembered these days for introducing the phrase “Bye, Felicia.” Written by Ice Cube and the record producer D.J. Pooh, the story unfolds over the course of about 16 hours in the life of a 22-year-old in South Central Los Angeles (Ice Cube), who, along with a friend played by the comedian Chris Tucker, has to find a way to quickly pay a drug dealer $200. “Like rap and much stand-up comedy, ‘Friday’ is based on opened-eyed acceptance of drug use and guns as part of its characters’ lives,” Caryn James wrote in her review for The Times, adding that the movie “makes fun of those realities and replaces rap’s anger with humor.” For a do-it-yourself throwback double-feature, watch this and the sequel, NEXT FRIDAY (2000), airing at 9 p.m. on VH1.
