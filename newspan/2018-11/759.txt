The biennial award is presented by the Library of Congress and includes a $10,000 prize. The judges selected for this year’s panel included the poets Natalie Diaz, Catherine Barnett and Betty Sue Flowers. Ms. Graham will receive the prize during a reading at the library’s James Madison Memorial Building in Washington on Dec. 6.
The title of her book “describes the speed at which time leaps ahead and rewinds in this mortality-haunted, panic-inducing beauty of a collection as intellectual as it is felt,” the jury wrote in a statement.
Ms. Graham is the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard University. She received a MacArthur “genius” grant in 1990 and has since published several poetry collections, including “From the New World: Poems 1976-2014,” “Place” and “The Dream of the Unified Field: Selected Poems 1974-1994,” which won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1996.
