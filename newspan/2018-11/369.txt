Our guide to the city’s best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
‘THE CREATION’ at Alice Tully Hall (Nov. 15, 7:30 p.m.). William Christie, stylish in everything he conducts, leads Les Arts Florissants in Haydn’s great oratorio. The vocal soloists are Sandrine Piau, Hugo Hymas and Alex Rosen. This event is sold out, so act fast and check for returns.
DU YUN at Miller Theater (Nov. 15, 8 p.m.). Following quickly from Kate Soper’s composer portrait, the Miller now looks at another leading force on the New York scene, Du Yun, whose “Angel’s Bone” (an “appallingly good work,” as my colleague Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim put it) happened to win the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for which Soper was a finalist. The International Contemporary Ensemble is on hand to play music that overflows, often raucously, with ideas.
RICHARD GOODE at the 92nd Street Y (Nov. 14, 7:30 p.m.). Still among the most rewarding pianists around, Goode here feasts on Haydn’s immense set of double variations in F minor, five shorter pieces by Mozart, Beethoven’s “Les Adieux” Sonata, Janacek’s “In the Mists” and, as if all that were not enough, a dessert of Chopin.
JACK QUARTET at the 92nd Street Y (Nov. 9, 9 p.m.). A later-night session from the nation’s most important quartet includes Andreia Pinto Correia’s String Quartet No. 1 (“Unvanquished Space”), Sabrina Schroeder’s “Slip Trains,” Zosha Di Castri’s String Quartet No. 1 and Ligeti’s String Quartet No. 2.
‘LES PÊCHEURS DE PERLES’ at the Metropolitan Opera (Nov. 14, 7:30 p.m.; through Dec. 8). Returning after its premiere in the 2015-16 season, this Penny Woolcock production of Bizet’s other major opera features Pretty Yende as Leïla (except for the Dec. 8 performance), Javier Camarena as Nadir and Mariusz Kwiecien as Zurga. Emmanuel Villaume conducts.
