“Death Metal Grandma” is a 13-minute film that touches on themes of reinvention, cross-generational relationships and sharing your truth. It profiles Inge Ginsberg, a 96-year-old who fled the Holocaust and became a poet and songwriter for some of the most popular singers of her generation. At age 93, she discovered a new way to be heard: death metal.

I first met Inge Ginsberg, the 96-year-old who’s recently become something of a death metal music icon, on a sunny August afternoon at her home two hours upstate from New York City. I’d half expected to see a place filled with Metallica paraphernalia, but it was nothing like that. Instead it felt as if I was visiting my grandmother’s house, having tea at a table with lox and cream cheese laid out.
I found her story remarkable. Growing up in Austria, on the eve of World War II, Ms. Ginsberg fled the Holocaust and landed in a refugee camp in Switzerland. After the war she and her husband, Otto Kollmann, moved to Hollywood and built new lives, composing for some of the most popular singers of their generation, including Nat King Cole, Doris Day and Dean Martin.
As Ms. Ginsberg grew older, she kept writing lyrics and poetry, and realized she needed to find new ways to reach an audience. How was she going to gain attention in a society where older women are neglected, silenced and often cast off?
