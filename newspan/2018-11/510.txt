It was 10:30 a.m. on Monday, Nov. 12, and Hilary Wagner was getting choked up. She and her fiancé, Tyler Train, were driving to Pelican Hill Golf Club in Newport Beach, Calif., where they’d be scouting the oceanside resort for their upcoming nuptials. Ms. Wagner’s tears might have been happy ones if she and Mr. Train were making the trip willingly rather than under duress. But the pair, both 28, were dealing with the unthinkable: Less than a week ahead of their Nov. 17 wedding, they learned that their original venue, Saddlerock Ranch vineyard in Malibu, Calif., had been severely damaged in the Woolsey Fire, one of several violent infernos currently ravaging parts of the state.
Among the 57,000 structures in the line of the Woolsey Fire, many were set to host wedding celebrations in the coming weeks, including the Lodge at Malibou Lake in Agoura Hills, Calif.
Ms. Culver feels similarly. “It’s like triaging an emergency but also knowing this is a wedding,” she said.
In the midst of chaos, the Los Angeles-area wedding community is banding together to help couples pull off the impossible. There are stories of venues fully reimbursing early deposits. “I’ve heard Stonewall Ranch has been refunding people left and right,” Ms. Carrillo said of another damaged Malibu location. Vendors and venue owners have also been waiving food minimums or site fees to ameliorate the stress of paying twice over for a wedding. These small gestures have been an invaluable bright spot for Ms. Wagner and Mr. Train.
