Dr. He said the experiment worked for a couple whose twin girls were born in November. He said there were no adverse effects on other genes.
In a video that he posted, Dr. He said the father of the twins has a reason to live now that he has children, and that people with H.I.V. face severe discrimination in China.
Dr. He’s announcement was reported earlier by the MIT Technology Review and The Associated Press.
Many scientists in the United States were appalled by the developments.
“I think that’s completely insane,” said Shoukhrat Mitalipov, director of the Center for Embryonic Cell and Gene Therapy at Oregon Health and Science University. Dr. Mitalipov broke new ground last year by using gene editing to successfully remove a dangerous mutation from human embryos in a laboratory dish.
The world has moved on to the stage for embryo gene editing. There will be someone, somewhere, who is doing this. If it’s not me, it’s someone else. I know this is probably going to be the world’s first. So if it’s not safe, or have any problem, it may ruin the entire field, and people may lose trust in the new technology. I feel a strong responsibility that it’s not just to make it first but also make it an example, how to perform things like this, consider morality of the society and consider its impact to the public.
It is not clear why altering genes to make people resistant to H.I.V. is “a serious unmet need.” Men with H.I.V. do not infect embryos. Their semen contains the virus that causes AIDS, which can infect women, but the virus can be washed off their sperm before insemination. Or a doctor can inject a single sperm into an egg. In either case, the woman will not be infected and neither will the babies.
