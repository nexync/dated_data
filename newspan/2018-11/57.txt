“Hadestown,” a new musical in which the singer-songwriter Anaïs Mitchell reimagines the ancient Orpheus and Eurydice myth, will open on Broadway in April.
The show, a tragic love story with prescient allusions to contemporary geopolitics, has been in development for more than a decade, and is now running at the National Theater in London. It began as a song cycle in 2006, was released as a concept album in 2010, had an Off Broadway run at the New York Theater Workshop in 2016 and then a Canadian production at the Citadel Theater in Edmonton last year.
“Hadestown” will mark the return to Broadway of the director Rachel Chavkin, a much-admired downtown theatermaker whose commercial debut, “Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812,” arrived to considerable acclaim and then spectacularly imploded.
The show’s cast has changed over the course of its development; the London production is led by a “Great Comet” alumna, Amber Gray; two stars of “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,” Patrick Page and Reeve Carney; as well as Eva Noblezada (“Miss Saigon”) and André De Shields (“The Wiz”). The Broadway cast has not yet been announced.
“Hadestown” is scheduled to begin performances on March 22 and to open on April 17 at the Walter Kerr Theater, which is currently home to “Springsteen on Broadway.” The show’s lead producers are Mara Isaacs, Dale Franzen, Hunter Arnold and Tom Kirdahy; it is expected to be capitalized for $11.5 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
It is the 11th new musical scheduled to open on Broadway this season.
