Krishna Reddy, a master printmaker, sculptor and teacher who played an important role in the shaping of Modernist art in India, died on Aug. 22 at his home in Manhattan. He was 93.
.... In Paris he joined Atelier 17, a printmaking workshop founded by the British Surrealist Stanley William Hayter. Intaglio printing, in which a plate is incised with an image, covered in ink and pressed onto paper, soon consumed Mr. Reddyâ€™s energies and became the art form for which he is now best known.
