The players’ union of the W.N.B.A. has opted out of its collective bargaining agreement, it announced on Thursday.
The deal will now terminate next October, at the end of the 2019 season. It was signed in 2014 and had originally been set to run through 2021.
The decision could set up a showdown between the women’s basketball league and its players, who have been vocal about what they contend is low pay and sometimes poor working conditions.
“We look forward to our upcoming discussions and negotiating a new agreement with the league,” the union said.
She added: “This is not purely about salaries. This is about small changes the league can make that will impact the players. This is about a six-foot-nine superstar taking a red-eye cross-country and having to sit in an economy seat instead of an exit row."
The median base salary in the W.N.B.A. was about $73,000 last season, and the top base salary is $115,500 — with some players making more from performance-based and other bonuses. This trails by far the N.B.A., which has a minimum salary of more than half a million, but also lags behind top women’s European leagues and China, where many top women’s players can earn $500,000 or more.
As a result, many players play essentially year-round, heading overseas when the W.N.B.A.’s summer schedule is over. Some have skipped W.N.B.A. seasons entirely, like Diana Taurasi, who sat out the 2015 season while earning more than $1 million in Russia.
The W.N.B.A. has been a consistent money loser. “The tickets are very inexpensive, but even at low prices, we’re not selling enough tickets to run a viable business,” Adam Silver, the commissioner of the N.B.A., told Bleacher Report.
