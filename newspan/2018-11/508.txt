After a devastating injury to Brooklyn guard Caris LeVert on Monday night, followed by an outpouring of support across the NBA, the Nets received unexpected good news: LeVert will not need foot surgery and is expected to return this season, the Nets team orthopedist said Tuesday.
In a 120-113 road loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday night, LeVert’s right leg appeared to bend inward at the ankle after he made an awkward landing while attempting a block with less than five seconds remaining in the first half. The hard-to-watch injury looked so severe, television viewers received a lengthy caution before a replay of was shown.
LeVert returned to New York Monday night, was evaluated at the Hospital for Special Surgery and diagnosed with a subtalar dislocation of the right foot.
Amid the Nets’ 6-8 start to the season, LeVert’s play has been a notable highlight. Averaging a career-high 18.4 points and 4.3 rebounds, LeVert looked to be a cornerstone of Brooklyn’s rebuilding process. He emerged as the team’s clutch player and the only player in the NBA this season to make multiple game-winning baskets with less than 10 seconds remaining in regulation or overtime.
The injury was especially crushing considering what LeVert had already overcome. LeVert had three foot surgeries while playing at Michigan, and had been treated by O’Malley as a senior. LeVert sought out O’Malley given his experience repairing the ankles and feet of several stars NBA, including Kevin Durant and ex-Net Brook Lopez.
“I knew Dr. O’Malley had performed surgery on other pro athletes with the same injury,” LeVert said in a video on the Hospital for Special Surgery website. “At that point I was worried about my future because I wanted play in the NBA and I wasn’t sure if this injury would affect my draft prospects,” LeVert said. He was chosen by the Nets at No. 20 in the 2016 draft.
