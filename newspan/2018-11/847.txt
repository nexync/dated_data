It’s Black Friday. Consider buying some local accountability.
Today is America’s national day of shopping. For anyone who plans to spend some money, I have a suggestion: Subscribe — or donate to — a media organization that covers your local area.
The New York Times doesn’t count, even if you live in New York. Nor does The Washington Post or any other national publication. All those organizations have a relatively large market of potential subscribers and advertisers. I’m talking instead about local-only news organizations.
They are vital to democracy — to holding accountable government agencies, businesses, schools and other institutions. And many local news organizations are struggling to survive, because their old business model, which revolved around print advertising, has been undermined by the internet. As a result, many local news organizations have shrunk or disappeared.
If there is a local news organization you already like and trust, I hope you will consider subscribing (or, in the case of public radio or other non-subscription media sources, making a donation). If there is not, I suggest looking around in the coming weeks and seeing whether you can find a valuable source.

One specific threat is the Sinclair Broadcast Group, as Jay Rosen of N.Y.U. told me. It is essentially a national conservative political group masquerading as a network of local news organizations. For more detail, read this New Yorker story by Sheelah Kolhatkar.
Despite these challenges, many local journalists continue to do great work. In some cases, says Nikki Usher, a University of Illinois journalism professor, the challenges seem to be inspiring local journalists.
