A reader recalls a favorite spot in his Bronx childhood.
I read with sadness the poor state of repair of the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in the Bronx. Having grown up in the Bronx more than 50 years ago, I recall those warm spring afternoons when we would walk the few blocks from our school to the campus of what was then uptown New York University.
We would play on the paths and sit on the lawns of the graceful campus, admire the Stanford White buildings and end up at the colonnaded Hall of Fame. Our fifth-grade teacher was an avid student of history, and she would patiently instruct us about the lives of the great and the not-so-great who were enshrined there.
I hope that the Hall of Fame will be restored so that once again it can serve as an elegant symbol of our civic pride and cultural history.
