Heavy winds were expected to threaten the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, but instead parade attendees faced near-record temperatures.
Under metallic foil blankets, tucked in sleeping bags on the sidewalk or holding quilts over their shoulders and wearing earmuffs over their ears, thousands braved temperatures in the 20s to watch the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.
The parade began with a performance by the Ohio State University marching band, which moved along the route with almost military precision — except for one woman who had stopped playing her French horn because her fingers were too cold. 
Thor, a palomino police horse standing on Central Park West, seemed to handle it better; all of the police department’s horses wore special jackets emblazoned with “N.Y.P.D.” on their rumps. “He’s warm,” the policewoman riding him said as she passed by. Was she? “Eh!” The officer said with a shrug, and trotted away on her horse.
Winds of 15 to 20 miles an hour were expected during the parade, with gusts up to 30 m.p.h. At points, floating balloon creatures, like the Grinch, teetered sideways in the breeze, which induced screams from the crowd. But handlers tugged him and others back into place.
At drugstores near the parade route, which runs from the Upper West Side to Herald Square, entire displays of handwarmers had sold out before the parade even began. Claire Churchwell, 27, stood in the aisle of a Duane Reade on Columbus Avenue holding her sneakers in her hand and inspecting her feet for frostbite. Finding none, she put on three newly purchased socks on each foot and headed back into the cold.
