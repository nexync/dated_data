It’s Cold Outside? Gather Around the Turkey and Argue About Climate Change.
It’s going to be a chilly Thanksgiving in the Northeast, with near-record cold temperatures in some cities. Which means, of course, that you can expect to get an earful from Uncle Walter over your turkey and stuffing about how global warming is just a hoax. He might bring up sunspots. Or something about Al Gore.
Many of us have an Uncle Walter, to borrow the character from the Ben Folds Five song, in some form. People can be cantankerous and counterfactual at any age.
But how to respond?
The map shows the expected differences in temperatures from normal. In an interview, Mr. Hausfather said that the purple blotch on the map over the Northeastern United States meant that it would be “one of the coldest, if not the coldest, spot in the world” in terms of the anomalous temperature.
But the logic doesn’t hold up, as the cartoonist Randall Munroe has shown.
We have discussed how to survive the Thanksgiving climate change argument before. The trick is not to get flustered in the moment that your debate partner brings up a theory or nugget of truthiness that you haven’t encountered before, such as a reference to the medieval warm period (irrelevant) or the allegation that the planet is actually cooling (nope).
If you must rebut, take a deep breath and excuse yourself for research. With the internet on our phones, a quick trip to the bathroom is like visiting the library, and sites like Skeptical Science and the denial response collection at Grist can be helpful.
Once you’re comfortably back home, you can send Uncle Walter this handy primer on global warming. It probably won’t convince him, but you knew that.
