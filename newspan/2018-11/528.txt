The jumping arachnids’ secretions have four times as much protein as cow milk.
Researchers in China have discovered that females of the Toxeus magnus spider secrete a milk-like fluid to feed their offspring. The study, published Thursday in the journal Science, also found the arachnid mothers continue to provide the fluid, which contains about four times as much protein as cow’s milk, well after their spawn had become young adults.
Though the spiders aren’t using mammary glands to produce the fluid, and hence are “lactating” in name only, the findings should prompt scientists to reconsider what they know about nursing and how it evolved, the researchers said.
Adding to their surprise, the researchers found that the mother continued to provide the fluid even after her young began leaving the nest to forage at about 20 days old. The suckling finally ceased at 40 days, though the offspring still used the nest at night for another 20 days.
“We think that it may reflect the high risk of juvenile spiders becoming prey themselves if they have to hunt for their own food,” said Dr. Corlett.
When the researchers blocked the mother’s ability to produce the milk by covering the opening with correction fluid (a.k.a White Out), all the hatchlings died within 11 days, showing their complete dependence on the substance.
