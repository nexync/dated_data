There is fear as well as joy in Saul Steinberg’s travelogue. To make progress, you must enter the maze of what is possible, the maze of everywhere you’ve already gone and everywhere you might go. Start at Point A, and try to follow the path he has drawn. Your eyes leap up, and turn left, and then there’s a sort of guitar fretwork that you must navigate, which seems to have been made with the help of a ruler. Then comes a wiggly bit. Followed by another left turn, a sharp left, and then a hard right. Very soon the eye gives up, overwhelmed by distractions. The lines transgress and bisect themselves. Consciousness is too complicated. Point B should be attainable, but it isn’t.
Steinberg was a lyricist of the metal nib — a twirler of nonverbal non sequiturs. He dipped his bitterness — and his delight, and his pearl-handled, inescapable sadness — into an ink bottle, and he went to work every morning. He was vastly successful and famous, which is fine, but beside the point. Steinberg’s point is his line. Sometimes it’s a horizon line, sometimes it’s a clothesline. Sometimes it trembles, and sometimes it’s very controlled and confident. He’s playing squash without a ball. He’s swimming under water without a snorkel. He’s climbing Mount Kilimanjaro without oxygen. He’s doing geometrical proofs without an eraser. He’s trapped in an endless board meeting, doodling in the margins of an annual report. He’s trying to find humanity, and he never quite does.
