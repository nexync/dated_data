The Knicks rallied from a late seven-point deficit by scoring 12 consecutive points Friday night, overtaking the visiting New Orleans Pelicans for a 114-109 victory at Madison Square Garden.
Emmanuel Mudiay scored 27 points and rookie Allonzo Trier came off the bench to add a season-best 25 for the Knicks, who trailed, 103-96, with 3 minutes 58 seconds to go after two free throws by the Pelicans’ Julius Randle.
Mudiay got the Knicks’ flurry rolling with a 3-pointer, and capped it with a hoop with 34.1 seconds left that put the Knicks up by five points, 108-103.
The Pelicans got within two on two subsequent occasions, the last time on an Anthony Davis dunk with 8.2 seconds left that closed the gap to 111-109.
But Mudiay made one free throw and Tim Hardaway Jr. hit a pair to close out the Knicks’ second straight win after six consecutive losses.
Mudiay’s 27 points were only three short of his career high. He had 15 of the Knicks’ final 22 points.
Trier’s 25 points surpassed his previous N.B.A. best of 23 this month at Dallas.
Enes Kanter had 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Noah Vonleh added 14 points and 11 rebounds for the Knicks, who were coming off a win in Boston.
The Knicks outscored the Pelicans 36-21 on 3-pointers in snapping a four-game home losing streak.
Davis had a game-high 33 points and 12 rebounds for the Pelicans, who fell to 2-8 on the road.
Julius Randle had 13 points and 10 rebounds off the bench for New Orleans, while Jrue Holiday chipped in 22 points and 8 assists, and Nikola Mirotic added 19 points.
Neither team led by more than 10 points in the game; the Pelicans led by six after one quarter, one at the half and three after three periods.
TIMBERWOLVES 112, NETS 102 Minnesota’s Derrick Rose scored 25 points, while his teammate Karl-Anthony Towns had 21 points and 9 rebounds, in the Timberwolves’ 112-102 victory over the Nets on Friday at Barclays Center.
Rose, a 30-year-old guard who won the 2011 N.B.A. Most Valuable Player Award with the Chicago Bulls, was 11 for 17 from the field, helping Minnesota get back on track after two consecutive losses. He has been hampered by injuries in recent years but has made a strong start to this season.
“I love telling Derrick how good he is and how M.V.P. Derrick has always been there and is still there,” said Towns, who played only 8 minutes 13 seconds in the first half because of foul trouble.
Taj Gibson had 16 points and 11 rebounds for Minnesota, and Jeff Teague finished with 15 points in the Timberwolves’ first road win of the season.
Six Nets scored in double figures, but the team shot 41.8 percent from the field. Joe Harris and Spencer Dinwiddie had 18 points apiece, and DeMarre Carroll finished with 13.
The Nets closed the deficit to 4 points on two free throws by Dinwiddie with three minutes left. But Rose made a floater, and Teague found Robert Covington for a dunk to help the Timberwolves close it out.
Minnesota swept the season series, having also won, 120-113, on Nov. 12 at Target Center. The Timberwolves have won three in a row against the Nets dating to last season.
Jarrett Allen and Shabazz Napier each scored 12 points for the Nets, and Allen Crabbe finished with 11.
“We came into the game a little lackadaisical,” Allen said.
The Nets trailed by 5 at the half, and the Timberwolves grabbed control in the third. Towns had 17 points in that quarter as Minnesota outscored the Nets by 35-23 for an 89-72 advantage heading into the fourth.
