Book Review|How Should 21st-Century Readers Approach the Bible?
As an atheist who dealt repeatedly with creationists as they attempted to force their myth into the science curriculum, I can attest that I have never viewed Genesis as “a pack of lies.” Rather, I view it as ancient fiction.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines a lie as “a false statement made with intent to deceive.” Those who constructed the Genesis account of creation could not have known that their story was false by the scientific standards we now hold. Modern religious zealots who still promulgate scriptural creation myths as true when they know better are, however, a different matter. They, indeed, are guilty of lying.

I support Brexit not out of nostalgia for our past glory. Instead, I doubt the exaggerated claims of the Remainers that we will lack vital foods and drugs when we leave the E.U. Won’t we be able to get them from Australia, New Zealand and the United States? The undemocratic structure of the E.U. and the drive for a United States of Europe with its own army also make me uneasy. Can we get away from this psychobabble and discuss the matter rationally?
