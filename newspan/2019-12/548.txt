Kimmel describes the writing and illustration process as “torturous.” He worked on the book all over the country, even on getaways with his wife. Using a fine tip black Chartpak pen (“Sharpees are fine for some things but they bleed a little”), he sketched on hotel notepads, consulted reference books about geese and made clay models so he could photograph his creations from multiple angles. The biggest challenge? Making his goose consistent: “Like Snoopy, I wanted the Serious Goose to be recognizable no matter what angle you see her from.” Along the way, Kimmel learned a few things, like the difference between a goose (female) and a gander (male) and his subject’s preferred snack (snails).
