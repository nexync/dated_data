Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan return for this sequel, and they’ve got Danny DeVito and Danny Glover in tow.
This is the sequel to a 2017 reboot (again directed by Jake Kasdan), which connected mightily with audiences. In that movie, a quartet of teens got sucked into a video game that assigned them avatars, which also served as virtual life coaches. Wimpy Spencer got to inhabit Dwayne Johnson (a.k.a. the Rock), while shy Martha got to kick butt in Karen Gillan’s body. Self-absorbed Bethany got a soft comeuppance being Jack Black. And “Fridge,” a giant jock, got cut down to Kevin Hart’s stature.
This all sounds more complicated than it plays out onscreen, which is to Kasdan’s credit. Adding to the twists is a body of water that enables avatar-switching; it reintroduces itself at a crucial story point, as one does. At another crucial point, the actress and rapper Awkwafina shows up to join in the ostensible fun; at another, Colin Hanks and Nick Jonas reprise their roles from the prior movie.
Rated PG-13 for video-game-style mayhem. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes.
