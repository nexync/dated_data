The release of dozens of Nicaraguan detainees came amid bolstered United States sanctions and criticism of a crackdown on hunger strikers.
The government issued a statement saying that 91 people were being released as a gesture of national reconciliation. But it suggested that their sentences were being converted to a form of house arrest, as opposed to the charges’ being dropped.
