There’s a reason Susan Rockefeller’s collaboration with Atelier Swarovski was inspired by bamboo and the mammal.

Hometown: New York City. She now lives in an apartment on the Upper East Side with her husband, David Rockefeller Jr., the great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller of Standard Oil.
Current project: Her latest venture is a collaboration with Atelier Swarovski called the Beautiful Earth Collection; part of the proceeds will go to The Nature Conservancy’s work to protect giant pandas in China. The motifs of the 15-piece collection, which has stud earrings, necklaces, bracelets, cocktail rings and stacking rings (her favorites), are based on the panda and the bamboo that it eats.
Styling flexibility: Ms. Rockefeller stressed that the collection can be worn myriad ways. “For earrings, you can just wear one stud on a side and wear a panda motif shoulder duster on the other,” she said.
