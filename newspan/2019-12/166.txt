DealBook|Trump Administration Hinders Authority of W.T.O.
The U.S. has spent two years chipping away at the World Trade Organization. This week, the Trump administration is expected to go a step further and effectively cripple the organization’s system for enforcing its rules, reports the NYT’s Ana Swanson.
• Over the past two years, Washington has blocked the W.T.O. from appointing members to a panel that hears appeals in trade disputes.
• Only three members are left on the seven-member body, the minimum needed to hear a case, and two members’ terms expire tomorrow.
Now, with the administration blocking any new replacements, there would be no official resolution for many international trade disputes.
The potential loss of the dispute body comes as Mr. Trump’s trade war on multiple fronts has thrown global commerce into disarray; another tariff increase on Chinese goods set for Dec. 15 could send markets reeling.
“The loss of the world’s primary trade referee could turn the typically deliberate process of resolving international disputes into a free-for-all, paving the way for an outbreak of tit-for-tat tariff wars,” Ms. Swanson writes.
It could also lead to the end of the W.T.O., because the system for settling disputes has long been its most effective part.
More trade news: House Democrats and the White House trade negotiator are approaching a deal for a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. But U.S. businesses could be in danger of losing key benefits in the deal. And an unexpected drop in China’s exports shows why Beijing wants a trade deal.
A case that could determine the future of the wireless industry heads to court today in Manhattan, where a judge will weigh an argument to block the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, Bloomberg reports.
