Neil Marshall’s comic-book reboot arrives on HBO. And Cher’s glamorous neo-burlesque club comes to Netflix.
HELLBOY (2019) Stream on HBO. Rent on Amazon, Vudu and YouTube. Neil Marshall directs this reboot of Guillermo del Toro’s 2004 and 2008 movies about Mike Mignola’s colossal comic book half-demon. David Harbour replaces Ron Perlman for the title role, taking on Hellboy’s red, knob-headed physique to battle an ancient resurrected sorceress played by Milla Jovovich. As Jeannette Catsoulis wrote for The Times, this movie is “exuberantly British and quite possibly off its rocker.” Rated R for “operatic splatter and stewed children,” this “crack pipe of a movie” probably isn’t for the faint of heart.
