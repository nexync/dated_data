Cuba Gooding Jr. played Mr. Kennedy in the film, which chronicled his friendship with a high school football coach in South Carolina.
James R. Kennedy, a man with developmental disabilities who became a familiar and beloved presence on the sidelines during a South Carolina high school’s football games, inspiring the 2003 film “Radio,” died on Sunday in Anderson, S.C. He was 72.
His death was confirmed by T.L. Hanna High School, in Anderson County, where Mr. Kennedy attended games for decades. The cause was not specified. A local funeral home notice said he died in a hospice facility.
Mr. Kennedy starting showing up on T.L. Hanna’s football field in the mid-1960s and became an integral part of the school, Sheila Hilton, a former principal there, said in a post on the school’s website.
As a teenager, she said, Mr. Kennedy could barely speak, was unable to read or write and carried a transistor radio — the origin of his nickname, Radio.
“Radio,” which starred Cuba Gooding Jr. as Mr. Kennedy and chronicled the friendship between him and Harold Jones, a T.L. Hanna football coach, played by Ed Harris, was inspired by a 1996 Sports Illustrated article, “Someone to Lean On,” by Gary Smith.
Both the article and the film detailed how Mr. Kennedy, under Mr. Jones’s mentorship, went from being an outcast to a beloved member of the community, about 125 miles west of Columbia, the capital.
After Mr. Jones retired in 1999, he and Mr. Kennedy men took trips together and shared “a desire to help others through service,” according to a website about their friendship.
James Robert Kennedy was born in Anderson on Oct. 14, 1947, a son of Bill Kennedy and Janie Mae Bolden Greenlee. He is survived by his brother, George, and several nieces and nephews, the funeral home, McDougald Funeral Services in Anderson, said. Another brother, Walter, died before him.
The funeral home said Mr. Kennedy would lie in state at the high school on Friday. A funeral service was scheduled for Saturday.
