A dark reimagining of “A Christmas Carol” debuts on FX. And an unusual documentary is on Hulu.
HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (2000) 4:40 p.m. on Freeform. For a more child-friendly tale of holiday repentance (with a far wider color palette), consider revisiting this lavish Dr. Seuss adaptation, which stars Jim Carrey as the ornery green Grinch. Directed by Ron Howard, this version gives the Grinch a back story — like “A Christmas Carol,” it involves a troubled childhood — and a playground of special effects. “Every so often, beneath the layers of gadgetry and glitter and its two million feet of Styrofoam (according to the production notes), you can glimpse what might have been an enchanted family movie,” Stephen Holden wrote in his review for The Times. Discerning children will likely prefer the 1966 animated version, which is available to rent on streaming platforms including Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube.
IHEARTRADIO JINGLE BALL 2019 8 p.m. on the CW.
