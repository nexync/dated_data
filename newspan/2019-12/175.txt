UNITED NATIONS — The United Nations General Assembly has approved a resolution strongly condemning rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minority groups in Myanmar, including arbitrary arrests, torture, rape and deaths in detention.
In a 134-9 vote with 28 abstentions on Friday, the body approved the resolution, which also calls on Myanmar’s government to take urgent measures to combat incitement of hatred against the Rohingya and other minorities in the states of Rakhine, Kachin and Shan. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, but they often reflect world opinion.
Myanmar, where most citizens are Buddhist, has long considered the Rohingya to be “Bengalis” from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all Rohingya have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering the group stateless, and they are also denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.
The Rohingya crisis exploded in August 2017, when Myanmar’s military launched what it called a clearance campaign in Rakhine State in response to an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group. The campaign led to an exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh and to accusations that security forces had committed mass rapes and killings and burned thousands of homes.
He said the resolution did not attempt to find a solution to the complex situation and refused to recognize government efforts to address the challenges.
It reiterated “deep distress” at reports that unarmed people in Rakhine State continue to be subjected to abuses by the military and security forces.
The resolution also called for Myanmar’s forces to protect all people, and for urgent steps to ensure punishment for rights violations.
It noted that the Rohingya have twice refused to return to Myanmar because of the absence of these conditions.
