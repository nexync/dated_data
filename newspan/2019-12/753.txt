A no-nonsense decision victory put Joshua’s star career back on track. Ruiz acknowledged too much revelry after his previous win and not enough preparation for the rematch.
The fight played out against a backdrop of concerns that Saudi Arabia was using this and other big sporting events to divert attention from its human-rights violations. They include the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Joshua has shrugged off concerns that he was being used in what some, like human rights organization Amnesty International, called a “sportswashing” exercise, and after the fight he thanked Saudi Arabia for hosting.
There was none of that drama in the rematch, with Ruiz rarely connecting cleanly with Joshua. When he did, it was with punches to the back of the head that earned him admonishments from the referee.
