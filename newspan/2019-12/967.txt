Christianity Today, a prominent evangelical magazine founded by the Rev. Billy Graham, on Thursday issued a scathing editorial on what it described as President Trump’s moral failings, calling for him to be removed from office.
The editorial, written by the publication’s editor in chief, Mark Galli, argued that the events that culminated in the impeachment of Mr. Trump this week by the House of Representatives revealed “profoundly immoral” behavior by the president.
The magazine urged evangelical Christians, who as a group have been steadfast in their backing of the president, to withdraw their support of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump harshly criticized the magazine in a pair of tweets on Friday morning, calling it “far left” and saying he had done more for evangelicals than any other president.
“He himself has admitted to immoral actions in business and his relationship with women, about which he remains proud. His Twitter feed alone — with its habitual string of mischaracterizations, lies, and slanders — is a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused."
“To use an old cliché, it’s time to call a spade a spade, to say that no matter how many hands we win in this political poker game, we are playing with a stacked deck of gross immorality and ethical incompetence. And just when we think it’s time to push all our chips to the center of the table, that’s when the whole game will come crashing down. It will crash down on the reputation of evangelical religion and on the world’s understanding of the gospel."
