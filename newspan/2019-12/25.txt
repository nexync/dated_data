Movies|The Oscar Field Has Narrowed. Who’s on Top and Who’s in Danger?
Now that the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild and top critics’ groups have weighed in, our columnist assesses the contenders.
Taron Egerton: Few contenders have worked the awards circuit harder than this “Rocketman” star, a good-natured hand-shaker up against a field of best-actor candidates who are loath to schmooze. Though you won’t catch Joaquin Phoenix and Adam Driver posing for selfies with eager voters, Egerton’s retail politics have kept him in the game: After popping up at award shows, for-your-consideration concerts, and Chateau Marmont parties thrown in his honor, Egerton was recognized by both the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild for his performance as Elton John. The Oscars may prove tougher to convince, but so far, so good.
