“For me Hanukkah is about frying in olive oil,” said Michael Solomonov, the chef of Zahav, who has created a dinner menu for the holiday that’s being sold to go at Whole Foods Market. Meaty and crisp chicken schnitzels topped with amba, a condiment he makes with apples instead of the usual mangoes, are the main dish. Alongside are crisp-tender green beans and mushrooms swirled with a tahini sauce, a sweet-sour eggplant and red bell pepper mixture, and plump, lightly fried leek and potato cakes. “It’s less iconic than usual, but I think it’s in the spirit of the holiday,” Mr. Solomonov said.
