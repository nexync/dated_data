Corrections that appeared in print on Sunday, Dec. 15, 2019.
An article on Page 4 about a New York Times project to photograph the record number of women in the 116th Congress misstates how many participated. Most female representatives and senators took part, not all of them.
The Check In article on Dec. 1, about several standout ski resorts, referred incorrectly to the location of Whistler, British Columbia. It is in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains, not in the Canadian Rockies.
The Shortlist feature on Dec. 1 misstated the surname of the author of “Leonardo da Vinci: The 100 Milestones” and “Leonardo by Leonardo” in several instances. He is Martin Kemp, not Kent.
