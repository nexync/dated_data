D’Artagnan now sells a free-range turkey raised on scrap vegetables.
This year, for the first time, D’Artagnan is selling turkeys, raised free range in Pennsylvania the same way as its Green Circle chickens, on scrap vegetables from food markets. The birds are grown to market weight more slowly than usual and air-chilled. I tried one for Thanksgiving without brining or heavy seasonings, roasted at 375 degrees for about 12 minutes per pound with a 30-minute resting period. The consensus was that it was very tasty, and the meaty breast was also quite moist. The turkeys are available throughout the holiday season.
Green Circle Turkeys, $57.50 (8 to 10 pounds) to $161 (26 to 28 pounds), dartagnan.com.
