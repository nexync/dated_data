“The Masked Singer” wraps up its second season on Fox. And a Norwegian noir series with Carrie-Anne Moss debuts on Sundance Now.
THE MASKED SINGER 8 p.m. on Fox. Heavy is the head that wears the pink flamingo mask: After episodes that have seen contestants like Kelly Osbourne, Paul Shaffer and Seal voted off, the second season of this bizarre singing competition show comes to a close Wednesday night with a two-part finale, during which the identities of three more masked singers will be revealed — and one will be crowned winner.
WISTING Stream on Sundance Now. Early in this new Norwegian noir series, an F.B.I. agent played by Carrie-Anne Moss makes a suggestion to a local investigator: It would be foolish to approach a person suspected of being a serial killer, she says, without toting guns. His response: “This is Stavern, not Texas.” That would be Stavern, Norway. Moss’s character is an outsider flown in from New York to help track down the person behind a string of murders (Texas has nothing to do with it). Heading up that investigation is William Wisting (Sven Nordin), a career homicide detective whose daughter, Line (Thea Green Lundberg), is a journalist — one whose coverage eventually overlaps with her father’s case. The series is based on crime novels by the Norwegian author Jorn Lier Horst, who was a police investigator before he turned to books.
CATS Stream on BroadwayHD. A fresh version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical “Cats” hits theaters this weekend, complete with “digital fur technology.” Those who want to refamiliarize themselves with the show (or who prefer old-fashioned, kitschy costumes and makeup) can see this 1998 filmed version, with Elaine Paige, John Mills and Ken Page.
