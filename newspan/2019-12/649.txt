What can we learn from heartache and suffering?
After Thomas Hooven graduated from medical school, his girlfriend of 12 years ended their relationship. It was only three weeks before they planned to marry.
“Broken Heart Doctor” is a two-minute animated film that touches on themes of love, loss and wisdom. It profiles a young doctor who works in the cardiology unit of a children’s hospital while coping with a heartbreaking breakup with his longtime girlfriend. In this setting, among children with cancer and other maladies, it is the doctor who learns from his patients how to heal.
3. An additional challenge | Respond to the essential question at the top of this post: What can we learn from heartache and suffering?
I started my pediatrics residency on the cardiology unit, which was appropriate: my heart had a giant hole in it. Just after I graduated from medical school, as I was moving into my fiancée’s New York apartment, she ended our relationship. We went out to dinner that night, and after we came home, she told me we were through.
She and I had been together 12 years, engaged for two; we had a wedding planned for three weeks later.
“I can’t believe you’re doing this,” I said from the edge of her bed.
“I know we’ll always be best of friends,” she said.
I left just after sunrise, suitcase in hand, feeling as if I had just fallen from a moving train. It seemed unimaginable that I was meant to report for duty at the hospital in less than a month. My new employers were expecting a freshly minted physician full of knowledge and an eagerness to heal. As it was, I could barely remember my name.
