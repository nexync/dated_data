A reader writes, “This is an amazing and disturbing statistic and a window into the president’s mind and mood.” Also: The British election; advice to the Democrats.
On Thursday, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, wrote and sent out 123 tweets. This is an amazing and disturbing statistic and a window into the president’s mind and mood.
Mr. Trump uses twitter like a “mind dump” to empty the contents of whatever is in his head in the moment. The president’s tweets show a mind and a man obsessed with a litany of personal grievances, perceived injustices being perpetrated against him and an impeachment mania. As always, it is all about him. No other presidents would find the time to do all of this tweeting; they would be too busy doing the people’s work, not attending to their own personal agenda.
Arguably, this huge wave of tweets, this veritable tsunami of words pouring out of the president, is one more manifestation of a mind in disarray, a mind in a state of deterioration. While no one can deny that having a strong economy and a booming stock market is unabashedly a good thing, having an unhinged, unraveling president most assuredly is not.
Let’s see if the Democrats draw any lessons from this. The Conservatives in Britain nominate someone widely seen as a buffoon. But British voters hold their noses and vote for him. He wins by a large margin.
This is because the Labour Party refused to nominate a moderate and instead ran a far-left democratic socialist with social programs costing large sums of money. The party also tolerated some of its members who made what were perceived by many to be anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements.
History awaits the interpretation of this by Democrats.

Please, Democrats, resist the snide attacks and nasty sound bites. Any one of the Democratic primary candidates is so much better than the current occupant of the White House.
Focus on one goal: winning in 2020!
