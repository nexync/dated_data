Two albums by Juice WRLD jumped up the chart after the singing rapper’s death on Dec. 8.
Roddy Ricch, a 21-year-old rapper from Compton, Calif., has topped the latest Billboard album chart, beating out the newest LPs from the Who and Camila Cabello, while news of the death of Juice WRLD sent his two albums back to the Top 10.
Ricch’s “Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial,” his first studio album, opened at No. 1 with the equivalent of 101,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. The vast majority of that total was from streaming, with songs from the album being played almost 131 million times; just 3,000 copies of “Please Excuse Me” were sold as a complete package.
Also this week, “Who,” the latest from the Who, opened at No. 2, the band’s best chart position since “Who Are You” in 1978, which also went to No. 2. “Who” was credited with 89,000 sales, most of which were made as part of a deal bundling it with tickets to the band’s latest tour.
Cabello’s second album, “Romance,” opened at No. 3, while Post Malone’s “Hollywood’s Bleeding” fell two spots to No. 4.
“Bad Vibes Forever,” a posthumous album by the rapper XXXTentacion, who was killed in June 2018, opened at No. 5, while two albums by Juice WRLD returned to the Top 10: “Goodbye & Good Riddance” rose 65 spots to No. 6, and “Death Race for Love” climbed 78 to No. 10.
The soundtrack to “Frozen 2,” last week’s top seller, fell to No. 7.
And on the Hot 100 singles chart, Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” completed the longest-ever trip to No. 1, reaching the top 25 years after its release.
