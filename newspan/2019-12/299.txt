Scores of states, counties and cities had urged the court to hear an appeal over whether such laws are unconstitutional.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court said on Monday that it would not hear a closely watched case on whether cities can make it a crime for homeless people to sleep outdoors.
The case was brought by six people in Boise, Idaho, who said a pair of local laws violated the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. One prohibited “camping” in streets, parks and other public property. The other prohibited “lodging or sleeping” in any place, whether public or private, without the owner’s permission.
A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled for the plaintiffs and struck down the laws, saying the Constitution does not allow prosecuting people for sleeping outdoors if there is no shelter available.
The Supreme Court typically understands the Eighth Amendment to address acceptable punishments rather than what conduct can be made criminal. But in 1962, it struck down a California law that made being a drug addict a crime on Eighth Amendment grounds.
In their petition seeking Supreme Court review in the case, City of Boise v. Martin, No. 19-247, lawyers for the city said the appeals court had heedlessly created a new right not grounded in the Constitution.
The petition attracted some 20 supporting briefs, many from cities, counties and states. According to John P. Elwood, a Supreme Court specialist at Arnold & Porter, that may have set a record for the number of such filings at this stage of a Supreme Court case.
Lawyers for the homeless people challenging the Boise laws said the Ninth Circuit’s ruling was modest and unexceptional.
