BLUE HERON at Corpus Christi Church (Dec. 22, 4 p.m.). This choir, rightly cited for recording one of the albums of the year by my colleague Anthony Tommasini this month, returns to New York as part of the Music Before 1800 series. With the Dark Horse Consort, they perform “Christmas in Baroque Germany,” with works by Praetorius, Gabrieli and others. Scott Metcalfe conducts.
‘THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL PASSION’ at the Met Cloisters (Dec. 21, 12:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m.). David Lang’s Pulitzer Prize-winning choral work surely ranks among one of the most successful recent pieces around, and here it receives two performances from the excellent Philadelphia-based choir the Crossing, led by Donald Nally. Before that, they give the premiere of “Spectral Spirits,” a new work by Edie Hill on poems by Holly Hughes.
MAKE MUSIC WINTER at various locations (Dec. 21). Make Music’s winter festival may not have the sprawl of its summer counterpart, but there are still 13 participatory parades and other events dotted around the city, one of around 40 involved this year. Of particular note is an eight-hour performance of Satie’s “Vexations,” a one-page work played 840 times in succession, by amateur and professional pianists under the Oculus at World Trade Center, from 10 a.m. onward.
NEW YORK STRING ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (Dec. 24, 7 p.m.). Jaime Laredo presides over the annual Christmas Eve concert by a crop of young players brought together for a short period of intensive study. They play Mozart: the overture to “The Marriage of Figaro”; the “Jupiter” Symphony; and the Violin Concerto No. 5, with Nancy Zhou as soloist.
