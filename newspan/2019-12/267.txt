The Kansas police officer resigned after video footage showed that restaurant employees had not written “pig” on his cup.
A police officer in Kansas resigned on Monday after admitting he had fabricated a story that a McDonald’s employee wrote a vulgar insult on his coffee cup.
Herington, about 150 miles west of Kansas City, has a population of roughly 2,300. Lenor Brazzi, the director of operations for the McDonald’s franchise in nearby Junction City, said at a news conference that the restaurant had been “transparent and fully cooperative” in the police investigation.
“While we’re glad that the evidence confirmed our evaluation that the McDonald’s and our employees, the crew members, were absolutely not involved, we stand with our community in being disappointed about these actions,” she said.
Mr. Hornaday said he could not reveal the officer’s name because it was a “personnel matter,” but said he had been employed for about two months after spending five years in the Army. He did not specifically say whether the officer had written the insult on the cup himself, but he did say that the officer was the “sole actor” in the incident.
In his original public Facebook post, Mr. Hornaday wrote that the officer had gotten the coffee on the way to work and was offered a “free lunch” as an apology, according to KSNT, a local TV station.
Such an incident actually happened in Kiefer, Okla., in November, leading Starbucks to apologize and fire a barista after a police officer’s cup had “pig” written on it.
On Monday, Mr. Hornaday said he initially believed his officer because he expected “a uniformed, sworn officer” to tell the truth. He did not believe there would be criminal charges after discussing the matter with the district attorney, he said.
But he said the department, now down to five officers, would “work tirelessly to regain the loss of trust” with its citizens and anyone hurt by the incident.
