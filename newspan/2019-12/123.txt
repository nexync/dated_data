Jennifer Tipton, a lighting designer who works in dance, theater and opera, is this year’s recipient of the award from the Baryshnikov Arts Center.
Theatrical lighting design sometimes goes unnoticed, Jennifer Tipton said, because it tends to focus attention on performers and sets rather than on itself. But that hasn’t prevented Ms. Tipton, a two-time Tony Award winner, from being recognized for the quality of her work. On Thursday she was named as this year’s recipient of the Baryshnikov Arts Center’s Cage Cunningham Fellowship.
Ms. Tipton, who works in theater, dance and opera, will receive $50,000 in support of a project of her choosing and the use of the center’s John Cage & Merce Cunningham Studio for up to eight weeks. The fellowship will also supply her with administrative support for her project.
Ms. Tipton’s career as a lighting designer began in the 1960s when she started working with the choreographers Paul Taylor and Twyla Tharp. Her work can be seen in the Broadway production of Aaron Sorkin’s “To Kill a Mockingbird.” She also recently lit Ms. Tharp’s “A Gathering of Ghosts” for American Ballet Theater, which returns in May.
