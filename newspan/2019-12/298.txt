Health|Alzheimer’s Tests Soon May Be Common. 
Diagnostic tests for Alzheimer’s disease are already here. But the results may raise as many questions as they answer.
When Dr. Daniel Gibbs, 68, a neurologist in Portland, Ore., noticed his memory starting to slip, he wanted to know if it was Alzheimer’s. He had seen its damage all too often in his patients.
The sort of testing Dr. Gibbs had can be expensive, and diagnostic brain scans usually are not covered by insurance. The tests are not for the worried well whose memories are intact.
Generally, even people without memory problems who have amyloid plaques in their brains are more likely to progress to Alzheimer’s, said Dr. Ronald Petersen, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
Dr. Rabinovici, of U.C.S.F., sees people who are distressed by their memory problems, knowing something is wrong and unable to get an answer from their doctors.
Before he offers diagnostic testing, Dr. Rabinovici sits down with patients and their families and asks how will they feel if the test is positive — or negative.
Dr. Jason Karlawish, an Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, did a formal study to gauge patients’ responses to learning that they had elevated levels of amyloid in their brain.
Wallace Rueckel, 75, of St. James, N.C., worries about what will happen as his disease progresses. He has been reluctant to let people other than relatives know he has early Alzheimer’s disease.
Jay Reinstein of Raleigh, N.C., 58, learned he had early-stage Alzheimer’s disease in March of 2018. He stepped down from his job as an assistant city manager in Fayetteville, N.C., later that year.
Mr. Reinstein has changed his diet, and now he exercises. He and his wife have made a will. He decided to become active in the Alzheimer’s Association and to do what he can to destigmatize the disease.
