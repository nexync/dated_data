The World Anti-Doping Agency’s unanimous decision, if upheld, would exclude Russia from the 2020 Olympics, but many Russian athletes could be unaffected by the decision.
LAUSANNE, Switzerland — The world’s top antidoping authority on Monday banished Russia from international competition — including next summer’s Olympic Games in Tokyo — for four years, the latest and most severe punishment yet connected to a yearslong cheating scheme that has tarnished sports, rendered Russia a sports pariah and exacerbated tension between Moscow and the West.
Under the ban, Russia’s flag, name and anthem would not be allowed at the Tokyo Games next summer or the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022, though the competitive effects may be minimal: Russian athletes not implicated in doping are expected to be allowed to compete in the Olympics and other world championships, but only under a neutral flag.
The World Anti-Doping Agency also barred Russian sports and government officials from the Games and prohibited the country from hosting international events. The decision, which Russia has 21 days to appeal, most likely will set up a series of confrontations in the coming months and years as Russia fights to have its athletes and teams compete at major events.
Jonathan Taylor, the British lawyer who wrote the report proposing the sanctions, which were approved unanimously by the agency’s board, countered in an interview with The New York Times the measures amounted to a humiliation for the Russian authorities.
