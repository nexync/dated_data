Sex Sells. It’s True Now and It Was True 100 Years Ago.
BLAST FROM THE PAST We don’t have a crystal ball so we can’t look into the future to see what will be on the best-seller list in 2020. What we do have at the Book Review is the ability to look back — either in our library of bound issues dating back to 1930 or in TimesPast, a handy digital tool that takes us back to the eras when O. Henry was carousing at Pete’s Tavern and Dorothy Parker was holding court at the Algonquin.
