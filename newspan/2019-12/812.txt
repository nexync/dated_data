This weekend an ice cube from beyond our solar system made its closest approach to the sun, trailing mystery and dust.
It wandered in the deep freeze of interstellar space for 100 million years or so, a locked vault of cosmo-chemical history. In spring 2019, this ice cube began falling into our own solar system. Feeble heat from the sun, still distant, loosened carbon monoxide from its surface into a faint, glowing fog; the orphan ice cube became a new comet.
On Sunday, Dec. 8, the comet that now bears his name — 2I Borisov — will make a wide turn around the sun and begin heading back out of the solar system. As it departs, it will steadily brighten and grow in size as sunlight continues to shake off the dust from a long, cold sleep. On Dec. 28, the comet will pass 180 million miles from Earth, its closest approach to our planet.
Where Is Comet Borisov?
The second known interstellar object is now passing through our solar system.
One of the astronomers waiting for action is Cheng-Han Hsieh, a colleague of Dr. Laughlin at Yale, who has been monitoring the comet daily with a worldwide network of robotic telescopes called the Las Cumbres Observatory, which has its headquarters in Goleta, Calif.
Dr. Hsieh and his colleagues are also planning to observe the comet with a set of radio antennas, at Green Bank Observatory, the Submillimeter Array on Mauna Kea in Hawaii and the ALMA array in Chile, standing by for an outburst.
