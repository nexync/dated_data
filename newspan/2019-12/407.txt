The decision, which was derided by Democrats, comes in a fight to win Wisconsin in the 2020 presidential election.
“This would create chaos to do this now,” Karla Keckhaver, a lawyer defending the Wisconsin Elections Commission, told the judge who issued the ruling to purge thousands of the state’s voters from the rolls.
The ruling, by Judge Paul V. Malloy of the Ozaukee County Circuit Court, grew out of a legal fight over what should come of thousands of voters who were sent letters by state election officials because they were believed to have moved.
Those who did not respond to the letters were to be removed from the voting rolls, but not until 2021, state officials had indicated. But a conservative group, the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, filed a lawsuit, saying that election officials were required to remove names more rapidly.
Judge Malloy concurred.
“I don’t want to see anybody deactivated, but I don’t write the legislation,” Judge Malloy said as he gave his ruling from the bench on Friday.
He discussed a hypothetical situation in which a close election might be tipped by an improperly registered voter. “If somebody in one of these close elections were to tie, and some voters voted that shouldn’t have been in that district because their registration wasn’t correct, you really can’t undo that,” Judge Malloy said.
Wisconsin Democrats, though, saw the decision as about something far different than following housekeeping rules when it comes to voter rolls. They said conservatives were merely searching for ways to remove Democratic voters in an effort to boost the Republicans’ chances in 2020.
State election officials said they were analyzing the judge’s ruling and sorting through what to do next. An appeal seemed likely.
In Wisconsin, where 3.3 million people are registered to cast ballots, voters who are purged from the rolls can choose to register again, including on Election Day.
