City limits can affect perceptions, and a criticism of Mayor Pete Buttigieg doesn’t hold up.
It can be tempting to use crime data to compare cities and identify trends. You might see lists on the internet that shout out this or that statistic about the safest or most dangerous cities in America.
But reporting practices can influence perceptions of crime as much as actual crime trends do. And decisions about where to draw a city’s borders and which offenses to count as official crimes can matter as much as how many crimes were reported in a given year.
Take the cases of St. Louis, often considered the nation’s murder capital, and South Bend, Ind., whose crime rate has been cited to criticize its mayor, Pete Buttigieg.
For the fifth straight year, St. Louis will most likely have the nation’s highest murder rate for cities with over 100,000 people. But that dubious distinction is in part a reflection of how its borders are drawn.
Some cities have larger boundaries, with suburbs included within city limits. The core of a city might have relatively high crime, but the numbers from suburban areas can bring rates down.
The city limits of St. Louis, on the other hand, are tightly drawn. With nearly three million people, the metro area of St. Louis is quite large, estimated as the 20th-largest in population in the continental United States in 2018, according to the census. The population of the city of St. Louis as measured by the F.B.I. in the Uniform Crime Report, however, was just over 300,000.
Measuring murder rates by each city’s entire metro area offers a more nuanced story. The accompanying table shows the top 10 murder rates in metropolitan areas with over 500,000 people.
South Bend got this designation based on the city’s violent crime ranking as reported in the Uniform Crime Report (U.C.R.). A quick glance at the F.B.I.’s statistics would seem to confirm this assertion: Of the 294 cities with over 100,000 people that reported in 2018, South Bend had the 27th-highest violent crime rate. Moreover, South Bend’s violent crime rate has risen since Mr. Buttigieg became mayor in 2012, when the city ranked 105th in violent crime.
But a deeper dig into South Bend’s crime statistics shows a change in reporting practices rather than a rise in violent crime. In fact, the F.B.I.’s U.C.R. report for 2016 (which USA Today used) includes a footnote for South Bend that says “figures are not comparable to previous years’ data” because of reporting practice changes.
The F.B.I. splits assaults into aggravated assaults, which involve a weapon or “other means likely to produce death or great bodily harm,” and simple assaults, which involve neither a weapon nor serious injury. The F.B.I. considers aggravated assault a violent crime — but not simple assaults, which are far more numerous.
Aggravated assaults rose 130 percent from 2015 to 2017, but the total number of assaults in South Bend remained basically flat, according to the U.C.R. data published by Jacob Kaplan, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pennsylvania. Only 11 percent of assaults in South Bend were listed as aggravated between 1998 and 2015, but that figure jumped up to 17 percent in 2016 and 19 percent in 2017 (2018 data is not yet available).
In other words, the evidence is telling us that South Bend didn’t become more violent; it simply changed how it counted assaults. The South Bend Police Department points to guidance received in 2015 from the F.B.I. to count incidents involving a weapon being displayed or threatened as attempted aggravated assaults. This could explain the increase in violent crime reported, and the data seems to bear that out. The city’s murder rate of 8.8 per 100,000 in 2018 was the 78th-highest for a city with over 100,000 people, and nearly identical to the average for cities above 100,000 (8.7 per 100,000).
What do we know about national 2019 numbers?
We can deduce the overall national picture for 2019 from an analysis of data from more than 60 big U.S. cities. Murder in these cities is up 0.8 percent this year, so it appears there won’t be a sizable drop in murder nationally, as there was in 2018. But it also appears there won’t be a major rise in murder nationally, as there was in 2015 and 2016. This methodology has a good predictive track record, including forecasting 2018’s drop.
