A small sample of the almost 60 romance novels written by Johanna Lindsey. She set her passionate tales in locales ranging from ninth-century England to outer space.
Johanna Lindsey, whose best-selling romance novels told stories of unbridled passion, revenge, submission and abductions among aristocrats, debutantes, pirates and fearless heroines, died on Oct. 27 in Nashua, N.H., her family recently announced. She was 67.
Ms. Lindsey set her passionate tales in many locales, including the Caribbean; the Barbary Coast; England as early as the year 873; Norway, when the Vikings ruled; 19th-century Texas, Wyoming and Montana; and the planet Kystran, in a series of science-fiction bodice-rippers.
Johanna Helen Howard was born on March 10, 1952, in Frankfurt, where her father, Edwin, was stationed in the Army. Her family moved to the United States when she was about 5. Her mother was Wanda (Castle) Howard. The family eventually settled in Hawaii, where Johanna attended intermediate school and high school.
She started work in a data processing program but left it when she married Ralph Lindsey. By the mid-1970s, believing she could write romance novels, she sent a proposed chapter to Avon Books, which also published the work of Ms. Rodgers and Ms. Woodiwiss.
Ms. Lindsey left Avon for Simon & Schuster in 2001, after writing 37 best sellers.
Liz Perl, the marketing director of Simon & Schuster, said that Ms. Lindsey had been a shy, private person who only occasionally toured to promote her books.
In addition to her son Alfred, she is survived by two other sons, Garret and Joseph, and four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1994.
Ms. Lindsey recalled that she had conceived the idea for “Captive Bride,” her first novel, years before she submitted that first chapter to Avon.
