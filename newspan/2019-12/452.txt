Politics|Labour’s Crushing Loss in Britain Adds to ‘Too Far Left?’ Debate in U.S.
Centrist Democrats portrayed Boris Johnson’s victory as a warning sign for the American election. Progressives said there were few similarities between the two political races.
Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, joined in with a cautionary tweet. And at an event held by The Washington Post on Friday, Mr. Buttigieg, who studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes scholar, said “it’s a little tough to draw comparisons” between the British election and American politics because of the Brexit issue.
Waleed Shahid, the spokesman for Justice Democrats, a progressive organization that backed Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — she shared a video from Labour on Twitter on Thursday — and other liberal Democrats in 2018, argued that Mr. Corbyn’s defeat was a different kind of warning sign: that Democrats must focus more on working-class candidates in 2020.
