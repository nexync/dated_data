Mr. Sanders released three letters from doctors with details about his health, nearly three months after he had a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas.
DES MOINES — Senator Bernie Sanders on Monday released three letters from doctors declaring him healthy, nearly three months after he had a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas, and disclosing that he no longer needed some medications relating to the attack.
“You have been engaging vigorously in the rigors of your campaign, travel and other scheduled activities without any limitation,” Dr. Monahan wrote.
“At this point, I see no reason he cannot continue campaigning without limitation and, should he be elected, I am confident he has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the presidency,” Dr. LeWinter wrote.
Mr. Sanders’s health has been under scrutiny since early October, when he experienced chest pains during a campaign event in Las Vegas. He then had two stents inserted into an artery. His campaign did not reveal that he had suffered a heart attack until after he was released from the hospital three days after being admitted.
In October, Mr. Sanders said he would release his medical records by the end of the year, vowing that they would be “comprehensive.” Letters from doctors are not the same as full medical records, but his campaign said that the information Mr. Sanders revealed was in line with what other candidates typically release.
According to the letter from Dr. Monahan, Mr. Sanders’s most recent physical examination, on Dec. 19, showed that he was 6 feet tall and 174 pounds. His blood pressure was 102/56, with a pulse of 62 beats per minute. His total cholesterol was 117 milligrams per deciliter of blood, HDL cholesterol (or “good” cholesterol) was 32 milligrams, and LDL cholesterol (or “bad” cholesterol) was 58 milligrams.
