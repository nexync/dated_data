The military academy used a flag with a skull and crossbones and “G.F.B.D.”, which stands for “God Forgives, Brothers Don’t.” The slogan has been associated with white supremacists.
The United States Military Academy has stripped a motto from its football team spirit flag because of its connection to hate groups, the academy said on Sunday.
Since the mid-1990s, the Army Black Knights football team at West Point has been using a flag with a skull and crossbones and “G.F.B.D.”, which stands for “God Forgives, Brothers Don’t,” the academy said.
The letters were on the upper lip of the skull.
“The motto was originally used to emphasize teamwork, loyalty and toughness,” the academy’s public affairs office said in a statement on Sunday.
The team used the motto until academy officials learned that the phrase was associated with extremist groups. The slogan was removed in September and the team is continuing to use the flag without it, a spokesman said.
“The academy immediately discontinued using it upon notification of its tie to hate groups,’’ the statement said. The school announced on Thursday that it had completed an investigation into the use of the phrase.
“Ideology, actions, and associations of hate groups directly conflict with our values and have no place at this institution,” Lt. Gen. Darryl A. Williams, the superintendent at the academy, said in the statement. The academy, which is 50 miles north of New York City, has 4,000 cadets.
Mike Buddie, director of athletics at the academy, said some of the players had embraced the phrase after seeing the movie “Stone Cold,” ESPN reported.
The 1991 action movie featured former N.F.L. player Brian Bosworth as an Alabama police officer who goes undercover in Mississippi to gain access to a white supremacist biker gang called The Brotherhood.
Mr. Buddie also told the sports network that the former cadet who initially shared the slogan with the football team did not know it had racist ties.
