A task force assembled by the governor recommended removing nearly 100 overtly discriminatory and racist laws that were still on the books.
Many of the laws, some of which are no longer enforced or have been invalidated, stem from the state’s segregationist past, including Jim Crow laws and Virginia’s Massive Resistance policy, a coordinated effort to thwart federally mandated laws to integrate schools, transportation and neighborhoods. Other laws prohibited interracial marriage and imposed a poll tax designed to prevent black Virginians from voting.
The Act to Preserve Racial Integrity, passed in 1924, forbade intermarriage or mixing of the races.
