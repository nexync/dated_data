Reginald Dwayne Betts has one of the more remarkable stories in contemporary literature. After spending more than eight years in prison for a carjacking he committed at 16, Betts earned a graduate degree in writing, then a doctorate in jurisprudence from Yale Law School, and has become an acclaimed memoirist and poet.
