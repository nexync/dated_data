The Chicago restaurant teamed up with the distiller Rhine Hall for this sippable tipple.
Rhine Hall is a fruit brandy distiller in the Fulton Market district of Chicago. The company, the outgrowth of a backyard hobby, now makes more than a dozen brandies and similar products. About a year ago, it teamed up with Alinea, the three Michelin-star restaurant in Chicago, to create a coffee liqueur. Made from handpicked beans infused in pineapple brandy, with vanilla beans added, the coffee liqueur delivers bright, lightly acidic coffee flavor and some sweetness without being syrupy. Sip it on the rocks after dinner, use it in cocktails or to drench gingerbread. Until a couple of months ago, it was available only at Alinea and its sibling bar, the Aviary, but now wine and liquor stores have it.
Rhine Hall Coffee Liqueur, $27 for 375 milliliters (12.6 ounces) from independentspiritsinc.com; $55.96 for 750 milliliters (25.3 ounces) from astorwine.com.
