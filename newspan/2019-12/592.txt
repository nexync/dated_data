 @MrsDowJones is here to teach us financial literacy.
Haley Sacks, 28, doesn’t just want women to save; she wants them to invest. Not only that: She wants them to understand the culture of investment banking.
To teach them, she posts memes on Instagram. Her account, @MrsDowJones, has compared Deutsche Bank’s trajectory since 2007 to Rob Kardashian; likened the hype ahead of the Uber I.P.O. to that surrounding the newest royal baby; and used Andy Cohen as a proxy for interest rates. Much like The Skimm, a newsletter and media brand that breaks down the day’s top headlines for a predominantly young, female audience, Ms. Sacks sees pop cultural reference points as a way to make stocks and bonds intelligible to a new generation of potential investors, particularly those often excluded from the language of finance.
