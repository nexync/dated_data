Religiously speaking, I’m something of a Christian mutt — the grandson of a Congregational minister, I was raised Presbyterian and educated at an Episcopal high school before converting to Catholicism almost a decade ago. (Before I did, I told a Jesuit friend that I had doubts. “Who doesn’t?” he said.) So the spiritually minded books on this week’s list hold particular interest for me. There’s Karen Armstrong’s “The Lost Art of Scripture,” which argues for a literary view of sacred texts, and Jack Miles’s “Religion as We Know It,” a history of belief and its place in culture. There’s Melvin Konner’s “Believers,” which looks for scientific and psychological explanations for the persistence of faith, and, less overtly but no less appealingly, the questing and philosophical poems in Charles Wright’s “Oblivion Banjo.” Any of those might do nicely to set the mood this week, as readers of various faiths and denominations hurtle toward their high holidays.
Elsewhere, we also offer a look back at the novels of the unjustly neglected Jean Stafford, as well as more recent novels from Margaret Wilkerson Sexton and Jokha Alharthi. There’s a history of a deeply flawed but influential psychology experiment, and a study of the American Revolution that argues it had negative effects around the world. And we look at current events on both sides of the Atlantic, with Mike German’s book criticizing the F.B.I. and Fintan O’Toole’s book tracing the roots of English nationalism and the causes of the Brexit debate.
