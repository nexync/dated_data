Ms. Karlan, a Stanford Law School professor, counts a landmark gay rights case as among her litigation experience.
Pamela S. Karlan’s formidable reputation as a scholar and Supreme Court advocate, coupled with a deep commitment to progressive causes, have made her a leader of the sometimes disorganized liberal legal movement.
During the Obama administration, she worked in the Justice Department’s civil rights division and received the Attorney General’s Award for Exceptional Service, the highest award employees there can earn.
She has also worked on the California Fair Political Practices Commission and for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
Ms. Karlan has argued nine cases before the Supreme Court, most recently in October, when she argued that employees should not be fired over sexual orientation.
Her litigation experience also includes work on big cases like the affirmative action case Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin and the same-sex marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges.
Explosive testimony. News media frenzies. A trial in the Senate. Here is how impeachment works — and how it has played out in the past.
Is she partisan?
Ms. Karlan has not been very vocal about her stance on the impeachment inquiry. She does not appear to have written columns or made appearances commenting on the proceedings.
But she is widely known in liberal circles. Ms. Karlan is the chairwoman of the board of directors for the left-leaning American Constitution Society. And in December 2016, she and other liberal scholars signed a letter expressing concern over President Trump’s statements and actions during the 2016 presidential campaign.
In 2009, Ms. Karlan was a favorite of the left, cited by some as their choice for the Supreme Court. She did not make President Barack Obama’s short list.
