OUR HOMESICK SONGS, by Emma Hooper. (Simon & Schuster, $16.) In Hooper’s second novel, a Canadian family tries to stick it out in their semi-abandoned fishing village after the fish are all gone, and their 11-year-old son becomes determined to learn where the fish went. “The town is filled with magic, and so is Hooper’s writing,” our reviewer, Elena Sheppard, wrote.
DEATH IS HARD WORK, by Khaled Khalifa. Translated by Leri Price. (Picador, $17.) Set during Syria’s current war, Khalifa’s fifth novel, a National Book Award finalist, tells the story of three siblings who honor their father’s request to be buried in his hometown. But transporting the body means navigating a war zone and their own conflicts. “Khalifa has, intentionally or not,” laid claim to “the mantle of Faulkner’s successor,” Elliot Ackerman wrote here.
