Is It Bad That I Gchat My Friends While I’m at Work?
And other pressing matters.
Gone are the days when the etiquette rules for office communication needed to cover only memos, phone calls and in-person meetings. Today we have to figure out the right behavior for email, Slack, instant messages, texts, social media and more — as well as interact with people who definitely haven’t figured out the right manners for each medium yet.
As a workplace advice columnist at Ask a Manager, I get a lot of questions about how to navigate online etiquette at work. Here are answers to 10 of the most common questions I hear.
Is it bad that I chat with friends on Gchat or Facebook throughout the workday?
Well, it isn’t great. It’s a distraction that will keep you less invested in your work than you otherwise would be, and it can affect your productivity more than you might realize. And if people happen to notice — particularly your manager or other higher-ups — it can look as if your head isn’t in your work, which matters when it comes to raises, promotions, what assignments you get and your overall reputation.
That doesn’t mean you can’t take the occasional Gchat break if you’re having a slow day. And if you’re in a job that’s slow all the time — well, you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do to get through a long, boring day. But for most people, chatting with friends for hours every workday will harm them in the long-term. And because there’s no real need to be in constant communication with friends while you’re working, why pay that professional price?
How do I follow up with co-workers who haven’t answered my emails?
I’m interviewing for a job. Should I connect to the interviewer on LinkedIn? What about Facebook?
Lots of people send their interviewers connection requests on LinkedIn, and that’s fine to do. Some interviewers will accept and some won’t — they might prefer to connect only with people they’ve worked with or otherwise know better — but it’s not a faux pas to make the attempt.
But stay away from Facebook in this context. Many people use Facebook only for friends and family, and trying to connect with your interviewer there is likely to be seen as an overstep.
Am I expected to respond to work emails over the weekend?
It depends on your job. There are roles where you’re expected to at least glance at your email over the weekend and respond to anything time-sensitive. But unless you’re working in a field or at a company where that’s a clear expectation, it should be fine to wait until Monday morning before tackling your inbox. In fact, it can be smart to stay out of your work email on the weekends so you don’t inadvertently train people to expect immediate responses outside work hours.
Emojis: Unprofessional or O.K. for work?
👎 In most offices, use your words and skip the emojis.
Interestingly, the answer is different for emoticons — meaning this :-) rather than this 🍺. An occasional smiley face at the end of a message can help convey tone when it might otherwise be misinterpreted and is usually fine in all but the most formal of offices. Just use them in moderation.
 Can I tell people to email me instead?
Unless you run your own business and call all of the shots (and can afford to turn away business), you probably can’t avoid the phone altogether. Phone calls are still part of the way business gets done, and you’re likely to have co-workers, clients and managers who prefer to reach you that way. And sometimes it’s just more efficient to hash something out in a five-minute call than it is to send a dozen emails back and forth.
But what you can do is let people know it’s easier to reach you by email — and if you make a point of being highly responsive on email, over time people may start contacting you there more frequently. You just can’t expect a phone moratorium.
Does it look bad to post on social media on days when I’m out sick?
It shouldn’t, but it can, depending on what you’re posting. If you call in sick and then your manager sees that you are posting selfies from a picnic in the park, it won’t look great (and she might not realize the picnic was last week and you’re just posting the photos now).  This is largely about optics, because of course you can tweet while sick. But perception matters, and it’s worth being cautious.
I keep seeing people with out-of-office messages full of all kinds of details — where they’re on vacation, or that they’re attending their child’s sixth-grade graduation, or that they’re taking the day off for their anniversary. Is that level of detail a thing we’re supposed to provide now?
Nah. You can if you want to, but it’s fine to simply say how long you’ll be away. Some people do include more personal details than that, out of excitement, pride or as an attempt to connect with people in a warmer way than the typical out-of-office template allows for. But it’s strictly optional.
If you do opt for extra details, watch out for T.M.I. People generally don’t want to hear about the mundane (“My driveway is being repaved”), the overly personal (“I’m vacationing with the love of my life”) or the details of your health (“I’m out sick with enormous hives”).
How can I get my co-worker to stop texting me after hours?
If that doesn’t solve it, feel free to ignore the texts until you’re back at work; over time, not getting the immediate gratification of a response might train your co-worker out of the habit. And to cut down on the aggravation factor, feel free to mute texts from your co-worker’s number (again, assuming your job allows for that).
