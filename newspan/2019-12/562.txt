The officer, Eric Alzafari, 42, faces charges that include official oppression and sexual contact with a supervised person, according to the sheriff of Galveston County, Texas.
A probation officer in Galveston County, Texas, who had been accused of sexually assaulting people under his supervision was arrested on Friday, officials said.
The officer, Eric Alzafari, faces multiple charges, including seven counts of official oppression, two counts of sexual assault and two counts of sexual contact with a supervised person, the Galveston County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. His bond was set at $95,000.
An investigation into Mr. Alzafari, 42, was opened in September after the Galveston County Community Supervision and Corrections Department received complaints, according to the sheriff’s office.
There are at least three adult victims, Sheriff Henry Trochesset said in a brief phone interview on Friday.
The woman also accused Mr. Alzafari of performing oral sex on her during an office visit, the affidavit said.
“This is an active investigation,” Sheriff Trochesset said, adding that more charges might be filed.
Mr. Alzafari was suspended and later terminated by the Community Supervision and Corrections Department, the sheriff’s office said.
Attempts to reach Mr. Alzafari’s home on Friday afternoon were unsuccessful, and it was unclear whether he had obtained a lawyer.
He was set to be arraigned on Friday, officials said.
