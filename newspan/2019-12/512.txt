Where do royals go once they’ve passed the baton to new heads of state in Buckingham Palace? Brooklyn, apparently.
Claire Foy and Matt Smith, who played Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip on Netflix’s “The Crown” before a new cast took over for Season 3, will appear opposite each other once again in March — this time, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
In Duncan Macmillan’s “Lungs,” they portray a couple who debate the merits of having a child as the world seems to inch closer and closer to doomsday. The New York production will have a limited run, from March 25 to April 19.
The two-character show, which had its debut in 2011, earned positive notices for its actors during a sold-out engagement this fall at the Old Vic in London. “The pair lend shape and dimension to a work that might seem piecemeal in lesser hands,” according to the New York Times review.
Matthew Warchus, the artistic director at the Old Vic, oversaw “Lungs.” Warchus is also the director of “A Christmas Carol,” which originated at the Old Vic and is now on Broadway.
Macmillan’s “Every Brilliant Thing” has been presented in many American theaters, including Off Broadway in 2014.
Foy and Smith starred in the first two seasons of “The Crown,” through the queen’s coronation and the early years of her reign. Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies have taken over the roles this season, when the series heads into the mid-1960s and ’70s.
