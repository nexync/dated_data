Ms. Rowling criticized that outcome and said she supported Ms. Forstater, who did not respond to a message seeking comment on Thursday.
Ms. Forstater’s case was widely reported in Britain but became an international news story because of Ms. Rowling’s tweet — and because of the backlash to it, which was powered in part by longstanding suspicion among some L.G.B.T. advocates that the author held negative views of transgender people.
A representative for the author said she’d had a “middle-aged moment” and hit the like button accidentally, according to The Guardian. But some critics viewed incidents like that differently in light of her expression of support for Ms. Forstater.
Ms. Rowling had not addressed the uproar by Thursday afternoon, and declined an offer from the L.G.B.T. advocacy group GLAAD to have an off-the-record conversation about the controversy, said the group’s spokesman, Mathew Lasky.
Ken Kleinberg, a lawyer for Ms. Rowling in the United States, declined to comment on the episode when reached by telephone on Thursday. Phone calls to The Blair Partnership, which represents her in Britain, went unanswered.
On Thursday, Alphonso David, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, the most influential L.G.B.T. advocacy organization in the United States, accused Ms. Rowling of being an anti-transgender fundamentalist and demanded she apologize for her statement.
