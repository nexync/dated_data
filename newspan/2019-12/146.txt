Gordon, who was released by the Patriots earlier this year, has served four previous suspensions for violations of the N.F.L.’s substance abuse policy.
Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Josh Gordon has been suspended indefinitely for violating the N.F.L.’s substance abuse policy, the league confirmed Monday, the latest pitfall in his troubled career. The suspension was first reported by ESPN.
Gordon, who has been suspended four times before for similar violations, was signed by the Seahawks after being released by the New England Patriots, for whom he played six games this season.
Gordon will not be paid and will miss the rest of the regular season and postseason for the Seahawks (11-3), who are tied with the San Francisco 49ers for the best record in the N.F.C. West. There is no timeline for when Commissioner Roger Goodell will decide what other penalties Gordon might receive.
Drafted in the second round in 2012 by the Cleveland Browns, Gordon missed the entire 2015 and 2016 seasons for violations of the league’s policy on performance-enhancing drugs and substances of abuse. He played only five games in 2017 before splitting last season between Cleveland and New England.
In October, while playing for the Patriots, Gordon injured his knee in a Thursday night game against the Giants. He was released by New England on Oct. 31 and promptly claimed by the Seahawks. In New England and Seattle, he had 27 receptions for 426 yards and a touchdown.
Gordon’s best season was his second year in Cleveland, when he had 87 catches for 1,646 yards and nine touchdowns. He received a two-game suspension for a drug violation that year.
