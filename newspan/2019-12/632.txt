These deconstructed bars from La Maison du Chocolat have two flavors, side by side.
The chocolate bar has supplanted the luxury truffle or box of assorted bonbons in the world of chocolate. Bars from companies across the globe are now labeled according to country of origin, percentage of cacao, added ingredients, style and even how they’re supposed to affect your well-being. At La Maison du Chocolat in Paris, the chef and creative director, Nicolas Cloiseau, has come up with a collection of “deconstructed” bars. Each box has a side-by-side panel of dark, milk or white chocolate, with other ingredients like dried fruit, nuts and puffed rice mixed in. In another innovation, the panels are scored for breaking into pieces instead of being molded in segments. There are six 2.75-ounce bars in the collection, each in a bright box.
