Weekenders make up half the population of this Litchfield County town, a split reflected in home prices ranging from somewhat affordable to not very.
Living In ... Kent, Conn.
When drivers cross the Housatonic River into the Litchfield County town of Kent, Conn., about a mile from the New York State border, they must stop before entering Bull’s Bridge, a historic one-lane covered bridge that invites those passing through to slow down. It’s an apt welcome to a town set in the foothills of the Berkshires, scattered with forests, lakes and rolling fields.
Slowing down was one reason Sarah Bacon, 44, came to Kent. Ms. Bacon, a writer, was living in a loft she owned in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, in 2013, when she was diagnosed with a progressive lung condition. A year later, she closed on a weekend home in Kent: a 1,900-square-foot, three-bedroom, 18th-century colonial on five acres. After a bidding war, she paid $760,000, $15,000 over the asking price.
Ms. Bacon was familiar with Kent from visiting family and friends there. “I fell in love with the area — the land, the water, the beauty,” she said.
Of Kent’s population of approximately 2,850, roughly half are part-time residents like Ms. Bacon. Last April, Peter and Abigail Hanby joined the full-time half when they moved with their 2- and 4-year-old sons into a 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom ranch. They paid $430,000 for the house, which was built in 1940 on two acres.
Mr. Hanby, 40, is an architect who works at Hendricks Churchill, an architecture and design firm in neighboring Sharon. Ms. Hanby, 38, commutes twice a week to Manhattan, where she is a director at Brightspot, an educational strategy consulting company. They came to Kent in search of more space and a different lifestyle when they outgrew the parlor-level apartment they were renting in a Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, brownstone.
With about a third of its nearly 50 square miles preserved as open space, Kent contains three state parks: the 2,302-acre Macedonia Brook; Lake Waramaug, bordering a lake of the same name; and Kent Falls, where 17 waterfalls cascade 250 feet.
The town is crisscrossed by Route 341 and Route 7, which follows the Housatonic River and parts of the Appalachian Trail. At the intersection of those roads, Kent’s downtown covers a few blocks lined with independently owned shops, businesses and restaurants, as well as the Kent Memorial Library.
The rest of the town is primarily residential. Housing options include modest Cape Cods and ranches, renovated farmhouses and sprawling estates with glorious vistas. Patricia S. Braislin, Kent’s assessor, said the town has roughly 1,390 single-family homes and 15 multifamily homes.
There are 138 condominiums in four complexes, one rental building with 10 apartments and three affordable housing complexes with 58 units. There are no cooperative buildings.
Based on information compiled by SmartMLS, Inc., as of Dec. 6, there were 39 single-family homes on the market, from a 718-square-foot, two-bedroom bungalow, built in 1930 on 1.8 acres and listed for $127,500, to an 8,933-square-foot, six-bedroom colonial, built in 1991 on 389 acres and listed for $8.995 million. There were five condominiums for sale, priced from $169,000 to $262,000, and eight rentals, from a 645-square-foot apartment for $990 a month to a 3,066-square-foot contemporary home with a pool for $20,000 a month.
The median sales price for a single-family home during the 12-month period ending Dec. 6 was $378,000, down from $425,000 the previous 12 months. The median for condominiums was $186,000 this year, up from $177,000 last year.
Nature-lovers can swim, fish, boat and hike on miles of scenic trails. Foodies can choose from the locally sourced Swyft or the frank. food company, from Fife ’n Drum Restaurant & Inn, with its extensive wine cellar, to Chinese, Korean and more. Full-timers and part-timers can mingle at events like the 43-year-old Pumpkin Run and a Holiday Champagne Stroll downtown.
Though rural, Kent is set apart from its neighbors by its downtown, with its array of boutiques along with basics including a hardware store, dry cleaner and the family-owned Davis IGA supermarket. Kent Barns, a complex of modern barnlike structures, is filled with galleries and businesses like the vast R.T. Facts antiques showroom and the independent House of Books.
Kent is served by Regional School District No. 1, which also serves the towns of Salisbury, Cornwall, Sharon, Falls Village/Canaan and North Canaan. Each town has its own school for kindergarten (and, in some cases, prekindergarten) through eighth grade; this year, 208 students, including 20 prekindergarteners, attend Kent Center School, in Kent. Most of the district’s 1,364 students converge at Housatonic Valley Regional High School, in Falls Village.
She said that on the 2018-19 Smarter Balanced assessments, 84 percent of Kent Center School’s fourth-graders were proficient in English language arts and 68 percent were proficient in math, compared with 55 percent and 52 percent statewide. Mean SAT scores for Housatonic’s 2019 graduating class were 522 in evidence-based reading and writing, and 492 in math; statewide means were 529 and 516.
Kent is home to three preparatory boarding schools: Kent School, South Kent School and the Marvelwood School.
Commuters to Manhattan, about 85 miles southwest, can catch Metro-North Railroad’s Harlem Line at the Harlem Valley-Wingdale station, about 10 miles away, in Dover, N.Y. Through trains to and from Grand Central Terminal take 103 to 111 minutes; round-trip fares are $51.50 peak, $38.50 off-peak and $521 monthly.
Those who prefer to drive all the way can head west into New York and take Route 22 to Interstate 684.
For more than a century, artists have made Kent home, inspired by its natural beauty and a shared creative zeal. Among the first was Robert H. Nisbet, who ran off to Kent in 1910 with his mentor’s wife. Notable colleagues followed, and in 1923, nine of them founded the Kent Art Association.
Fast forward to the 1980s, when Jacques Kaplan, a charismatic furrier and collector, arrived from New York and opened the Paris New York Kent Gallery. “He was determined to make Kent a mecca for artists,” said Marge Smith, the Kent Historical Society’s curator and archivist.
