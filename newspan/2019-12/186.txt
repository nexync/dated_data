They Came to Play Table Tennis. They Were Deported at Gunpoint in the Dark.
Two Nigerian students, in Croatia for a sports tournament, were mistaken for undocumented migrants. They were robbed of their money and clothes and expelled to a country they had never heard of.
On their last night, they were arrested by the police while on an evening stroll, and accused of entering the country illegally from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country to Croatia’s south.
“The police have no record of them exiting the Republic of Croatia legally, nor have the police officers working on combating irregular migration taken any action towards persons with their first and last name,” the Interior Ministry said in an email on Thursday.
But the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations department that gave assistance to the Nigerians in Bosnia, reviewed the men’s documents and confirmed that their Croatian visas were valid until Dec. 3 — meaning they were in the country legally when they were deported. Records provided by the tournament organizers show they both participated in the table tennis competition.
Their mobile phones were confiscated, meaning they can only be contacted by the center’s landline.
“We have been locked up and it’s not fair — we are human beings,” said Mr. Eboh.
