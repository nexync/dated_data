The once-every-five-year survey of new art in the city is back.
When she was named director of MoMA PS1 this summer, the British curator Kate Fowle said she would still make time to organize exhibitions and work directly with artists. Next year, she will — as one of four curators of Greater New York, the art center’s once-every-five-year survey of contemporary art made in and around the city.
The first edition of Greater New York took place in 2000, and marked the first collaboration between PS1 and the Museum of Modern Art, which had merged the previous year. That show and the one in 2005 focused on the work of up-and-comers. “But it’s very different now,” Ms Fowle said. “It’s extremely difficult to survive in New York as a young, emerging artist.” With that in mind, the 2020 Greater New York will include artists from all generations, since “some of the most interesting conversations between people at the moment are intergenerational,” she said.
