In a recent interview with Esquire, the actor said he used “himself” and “herself,” widely taken to mean that he had embraced gender-fluid pronouns.
His comments were widely taken to mean that he had embraced gender-fluid pronouns. But on Tuesday, in an interview with the Times reporter Dave Itzkoff for a forthcoming “Star Wars” article, Williams, 82, said he was not aware of how his words would be interpreted.
“Men should not be afraid or ashamed of expressing the soft side of themselves,” added Williams, who did not ask that others use different pronouns for him.
Williams’s clarification speaks to a broader and often divisive transformation taking place: the increasingly common practice of choosing a pronoun that best reflects one’s gender identity, and asking others to adhere to it. But society’s shifting understanding of gender and the language used to describe it should not lead to presumptions, said Nick Adams, director of transgender representation at the L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy organization GLAAD.
“You need to listen to what a person actually tells you about their gender identity: their deeply held sense of their own gender,” added Adams, who is one of GLAAD’s transgender staff members.
Gender identity is one’s internal, personal sense of being a man, a woman or outside that binary; sexual orientation describes a person’s enduring physical or emotional attraction to another person (like straight, gay, lesbian or bisexual), GLAAD explains on its website.
Jung was the Swiss psychiatrist who founded the field of analytical psychology. He theorized that men and women unconsciously carry qualities of the opposite gender — that men contain feminine qualities, and women masculine ones. “Every man carries within himself the eternal image of woman,” Jung wrote in his book “Memories, Dreams, Reflections,” first published around the year he died, 1961.
