You are correct: It would be very freaky! But freakiness is not necessarily bad. While taking a beloved pet to the taxidermist is unusual these days, it was not uncommon in the Victorian era, when a menagerie of dead things in the home was chic. Precious Creature, a “pet aftercare” company in California, offers an array of services: from preservation of just a paw or a tail to complete skeletal cleaning and articulation. You could try to out-freak your mom by suggesting that you’d prefer to wear Jasper’s skull as a necklace. But better to speak plainly. Grieving, when it comes, is hard, and you will need her support — not Jasper’s glassy, dead stare.
