Europe|Trump and Pompeo Spoke to Russian Official About U.S. Elections. Did Only One Deliver a Warning?
Standing next to Mr. Lavrov at the news conference at the State Department, Mr. Pompeo said he had reiterated the American government’s disapproval of Russia’s interference efforts.
American intelligence agencies say Russian intelligence services and the military carried out an organized interference campaign during the 2016 election and may do so again in 2020. The Justice Department indicted 12 Russian hackers last year for electronic intrusion into the Democratic National Committee and the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.
Andrew S. Weiss, a Russia and Ukraine expert who is the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Mr. Lavrov’s visit was most interesting because it happened soon after the foreign minister came from a meeting among several nations in Paris, including Russia but not the United States, to discuss the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
