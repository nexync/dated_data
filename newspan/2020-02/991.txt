Two great restaurant reviews for you: the first of Tavern by WS here in New York City, by Pete Wells; and the second of Nari in San Francisco, by Tejal Rao.
It has nothing to do with pork bellies or lager, but this Nori Onishi profile of the French pedophile Gabriel Matzneff, now hiding out on the Italian Riviera, is really strong, and beautifully written.
Finally, here’s Etta James with “W-O-M-A-N,” live at the Montreux Jazz Festival, 1975. It’s long and it’s loud and I hope your weekend’s the same. I’ll see you on Sunday.
