The Democrats in Iowa are making a furious last-minute case against the president. So is a Tea Party hero.
DES MOINES — The line outside the Trump rally on Thursday night was perhaps not the safest space to try to conduct a Socratic dialogue about the nature of truth. But Joe Walsh — former Tea Party congressman, former right-wing radio host, current Trump opponent — leaned right in.
A nanosecond passed, while the supporter bristled at this unfamiliar scenario. “Nothing comes to mind,” he said.
Mr. Walsh mentioned that President Trump, despite promising fiscal responsibility, had presided over an increase in the federal deficit greater than that under President Barack Obama.
If it is hard to be a Democratic candidate in the crowded and uncertain 2020 field, it may be even harder to be a Republican trying to present a legitimate alternative to a president whose supporters won’t entertain the idea of anyone else, and who is all but certain to be the party’s nominee.
Mr. Trump won Iowa with 51 percent of the vote in 2016 and still has high approval ratings from the state’s Republicans. But if local party members were feeling rather left out this past week with so much focus on the Democrats — all those candidates, all those events — the president had swooped in to remind them that there was a new election coming up and that, as he said on Twitter, he was “America’s Greatest President.” And Mr. Walsh was there to present a countermessage: No, he wasn’t.
There used to be three Republican challengers — Mr. Walsh, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts and former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina — but Mr. Sanford dropped out just two months after entering the race, and now there are two.
The odds are never great for same-party challengers when an incumbent president runs for re-election. But the candidates say that as Mr. Trump has consolidated his hold over the Republican Party, things have gotten increasingly difficult. For one thing, the party has, in 37 states and territories, changed the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, a move likely to limit dissenting voices on the convention floor.
Also, many state Republican committees have canceled this year’s primaries altogether; others have put up prohibitively difficult barriers for challengers to enter or said they would hold primaries with just a single name — Donald J. Trump — on the ballot.
“They’re behind Trump lock and key,” Mr. Walsh said. When he showed up at the Republican National Committee in Washington last month to lodge a complaint about what he said was “the disenfranchisement of millions of Republican voters,” the guards wouldn’t let him past the lobby.
In a phone interview, Mr. Weld said he felt like “a two-headed cow at the Iowa State Fair,” a figure of curiosity on account of his uphill campaign. He said that many Republicans shared his view of the president but were afraid to say so.
He and Mr. Walsh have also been making their case to voters in one-on-one conversations in bars and coffee shops in Des Moines in the lead-up to Monday’s caucuses. James Marren, who showed up at the Exile bar to talk to Mr. Walsh the other night, said that he had encountered the candidate before, at a veterans’ group in Dubuque, and that he was a changed man from his days as a right-wing, pro-Trump radio host spouting incendiary conspiracy theories.
But at the Trump rally, it was a different story. Virtually everyone Mr. Walsh spoke to disagreed with virtually everything he said.
After just a few minutes of these encounters, Mr. Walsh was beginning to seem like the most masochistic person in Iowa.
The turning point for him was Mr. Trump’s 2018 meeting in Helsinki with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, in which Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Putin’s claim — contrary to American intelligence — that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 election. “That was the most unpatriotic thing I’ve ever seen an American president do,” Mr. Walsh said.
Suddenly, in line, Mr. Walsh ran into an old neighbor from Chicago, Mark Weyermuller, who had supported him in his congressional days but had traveled to Des Moines on this occasion for the president.
It was an awkward encounter. “You know they’ve canceled the Republican primaries in 10 states,” Mr. Walsh said.
“I’m happy for you, but I’m supporting Donald J. Trump,” he said, and he moved on.
Then there was Matt Locke, a.k.a. the Conservative Sharpshooter, a talk-radio and podcast host who had traveled from Texas to spend an evening listening to Mr. Trump.
The two talked at loud cross-purposes about topics like corruption among Ukrainian prosecutors; Democrats who have foreign investments; and, once again, whether Mr. Trump has ever lied. (“I don’t know,” Mr. Locke said sarcastically. “Has he?”) The discussion turned to the time Mr. Trump publicly invited China to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family.
The two agreed to vehemently disagree, and Mr. Walsh went off into the cold to find some other voters who also disagreed with him.
