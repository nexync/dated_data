THE SPIRIT OF SCIENCE FICTION, by Roberto Bolaño. Translated by Natasha Wimmer. (Penguin, 196 pp., $16.) Written by the acclaimed Chilean author when he was 31, this novel tracks two young poets as they wander through Mexico City, seeking the literary life. “This playfully difficult, gem-choked puzzle of a book ... serves as a key to Bolaño’s later work, unlocking clues to his abiding obsessions,” Liesl Schillinger wrote here.
SLEEPING WITH STRANGERS: How the Movies Shaped Desire, by David Thomson. (Vintage, 348 pp., $17.) The prolific film scholar and critic Thomson blends memoir and history to explore the multifaceted connections between film, masculinity, femininity and modern erotic life. “Thomson, a stylist extraordinaire, has written an unaccountable and irresistible book,” Daphne Merkin wrote in her review.
