Silicon Valley is abuzz over a series of tweets from Chamath Palihapitiya, the venture capitalist and provocateur, suggesting that investment firms and start-ups should look more closely at who’s giving them money.
• This conversation started over a year ago around Saudi Arabia’s investments in Uber and SoftBank’s Vision Fund, after the dissident writer Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in a Saudi consulate.
• But the decibel level is getting louder, and such questions may become a larger part of big investors’ decisions.
A programming note: Marcelo Claure, SoftBank’s C.O.O. and WeWork’s chairman, will talk with Andrew on “Squawk Box” at 8 a.m. It will be Mr. Claure’s first interview since WeWork named a new C.E.O. — and comes amid reports of trouble for SoftBank’s next Vision Fund.
Netflix might have hoped that this year’s Academy Awards would be its breakthrough. It came away disappointed.
• The big winner instead was the South Korean satire “Parasite,” which became the first non-English-language movie to win best picture.
But don’t feel too bad for Netflix. As Ryan Faughnder of the LA Times notes, the streaming giant plans to spend $17.3 billion on content this year. And all those nominations had already burnished its street cred. So what’s an extra $70 million?
The attorney general made waves last week when he suggested that the U.S. back takeovers of Nokia or Ericsson, Huawei of China’s European rivals on 5G networking — or buy them outright. But his colleagues in the Trump administration don’t seem keen.
• Larry Kudlow, the president’s chief economic adviser, said the U.S. “is not in the business of buying companies, whether they’re domestic or foreign,” according to David Shepardson of Reuters, though he added there was “nothing to prohibit” American tech companies from making the move.
• And Vice President Mike Pence said the administration would follow a plan laid out by the Federal Communications Commission’s chairman to free up more 5G spectrum.
Those comments probably dampened investors’ hopes for a takeover or two. Shares in both Nokia and Ericsson jumped on Friday — but were down in trading this morning.
Goldman Sachs has made it very clear that it wants to be known for more than investment banking and trading. But some impending departures may set back its private equity ambitions.
• Sumit Rajpal and Andrew Wolff, two of the three heads of a big private investing unit, are retiring, Dakin Campbell of Business Insider reports. The division will now be run by the remaining head, Julian Salisbury.
• Mr. Rajpal and Mr. Wolff were expected to lead Goldman’s latest private equity fund, which was scheduled to begin formal fund-raising this week with a target of $8 billion.
Goldman’s C.E.O., David Solomon, was warned this might happen when he decided to combine several investment teams into one division, Mr. Campbell reports.
Why it matters: Goldman has hoped to raise $100 billion more in private equity assets over the next five years, Liz Hoffman of the WSJ points out, challenging the likes of Blackstone and KKR. Infighting probably won’t help.
The Information, which Jessica Lessin founded in 2013 to dive deep into tech news, costs $399 a year. But the tech elite doesn’t seem to mind ponying up, another sign that subscriptions can sustain a healthy news outlet, Ed Lee of the NYT writes.
• “She pays competitive salaries (albeit without equity) — as much as $180,000 or more for some top reporters,” Mr. Lee writes.
• The site has regularly broken big stories, like sexual harassment allegations against a venture capital mogul and management problems at Google’s Nest division.
• Subscribers include James Murdoch and Laurene Powell Jobs.
But she still has hurdles to clear. She might have to hit 40,000 paying readers by this year to meet sales objectives — when she only passed 20,000 around the middle of last year, Mr. Lee reports.
Of course, it didn’t hurt Bill Gates to have Roger Federer as his doubles partner. And the match was for charity.
That said, Mr. Gates “played one pinpoint lob volley that the announcer described as ‘the billionaire’s touch,’” according to the AP.
