“Parasite,” the acclaimed thriller by Bong Joon Ho about class tensions boiling over in a wealthy family’s home, this month became the first film not in the English language to win the Academy Award for best picture in the 92-year history of the competition.
The film also won best director, original screenplay and international feature, marking a moment of pride for many Asian-Americans and a turning point in the academy’s long history of embracing stories told by white filmmakers.
Mr. Trump, however, was clearly not impressed.
Mr. Trump expressed nostalgia for Hollywood films from a bygone era.
“Let’s get ‘Gone With the Wind.’ Can we get, like, ‘Gone With the Wind’ back, please?” he said, lauding the 1939 romantic saga set in the South around the Civil War, which won a host of Academy Awards, including best picture.
Hollywood and the Academy Awards have long been a favorite target for Republicans who decry the film industry as a bastion of liberalism. And the awards ceremony this year featured speeches by celebrities attacking Mr. Trump.
“They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week,” Mr. Pitt said in his speech.
“He’s a little wiseguy,” Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump’s attack on “Parasite” prompted a response from the Democratic National Committee.
Neon, the independent film distributor behind “Parasite,” also responded to Mr. Trump’s broadside with an acid reference to the movie’s English subtitles.
