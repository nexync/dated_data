Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the company’s music director, will travel with the ensemble to Britain, France and Germany in 2021.
In Paris and Baden-Baden, the orchestra will also offer a program of Strauss’s tone poem “Don Juan” and Act I from Wagner’s “Die Walküre,” sung by Christine Goerke (Sieglinde), Brandon Jovanovich (Siegmund) and Günther Groissböck (Hunding). It will also include “Sinfonia (for Orbiting Spheres),” a brief work by Missy Mazzoli — the contemporary composer who has quickly become a darling of the Met, with a commission in progress and the house’s orchestra performing in her opera “Breaking the Waves” at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in June as part of BAM’s spring season.
