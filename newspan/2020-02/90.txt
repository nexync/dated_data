“Get Up, Stand Up! The Bob Marley Story” will premiere at the Lyric Theatre in London’s West End next year.
Arinzé Kene has the title role in “Get Up, Stand Up! The Bob Marley Story,” opening in London.
“Get Up, Stand Up! The Bob Marley Story,” a musical about the life and work of Marley, the reggae superstar and political voice, will begin previews on Feb. 6, 2021, at the Lyric Theatre in London’s West End.
The lead producer is Suzette Newman, formerly of Island Records, the label that brought Marley to a global audience. Chris Blackwell, the founder of Island Records, is also a producer. Earlier iterations of the musical include “Marley,” written and directed by Kwame Kwei-Armah, and presented in 2015 at Center Stage in Baltimore while Mr. Kwei-Armah was the artistic director there. Another producer of this musical, he is now artistic director at the Young Vic.
In 2017, the same musical by a different name, “One Love: The Bob Marley Musical,” played at the Birmingham Repertory Theater in Britain.
The earlier incarnations focused on two years of Marley’s life, 1976 to 1978, when he fled to London after an attempt to kill him, and on a peace concert he held back in Kingston, Jamaica.
