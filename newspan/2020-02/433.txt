NEW DELHI — President Trump on Tuesday called the conviction of the former film mogul Harvey Weinstein on two felony sex crime charges “a great victory” for women that “sends a very strong message” about sexual misconduct, even as he sought to highlight the defendant’s ties to Democrats.
Asked whether justice had been done in the case, Mr. Trump first stressed that he had never liked Mr. Weinstein even though they knew each other through New York circles. He then noted that the Hollywood producer had been an active friend and fund-raiser for Democratic politicians over the years.
E. Jean Carroll, a longtime Elle magazine advice columnist, accused Mr. Trump last year of raping her in a dressing room at an upscale New York department store more than 20 years ago and then sued him for defamation when he called her a liar. She said last week that she had been fired by Elle because of Mr. Trump’s insults against her.
The president made no mention of that or other allegations against him on Tuesday, but in the past he has often expressed empathy or given the benefit of the doubt to allies and appointees accused of sexual misconduct like the Senate candidate Roy S. Moore, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly.
