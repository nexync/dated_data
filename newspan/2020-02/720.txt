This week, Leslie Jamison reviews Jenny Offill’s new novel, “Weather.” In 2014, Roxane Gay wrote for the Book Review about “Dept. of Speculation,” Offill’s novel about a fractured marriage between a writer and a radio broadcaster.
Jenny Offill’s second novel, “Dept. of Speculation,” charts the course of a marriage through curious, often shimmering fragments of prose.
Offill is a smart writer with a canny sense of pacing; just when you want to abandon the fragmented puzzle pieces of the novel, she reveals a moment of breathtaking tenderness. Here for instance is the narrator remembering the early days of her relationship: “I bought a warmer coat with many ingenious pockets. You put your hands in all of them.” Details like this cast welcome light on the couple’s history and intimacy.
First, we are part of the marriage and then we are studying the marriage from a distance as things begin to fall apart. There is an infidelity and an excruciating period of indecision and self-doubt as the wife, as she is now known, tries to assess her role in the marriage coming apart, and as she determines the right and proper shape for her anger.
As the husband and wife try to repair their relationship, he often seems petulant and repulsively indistinct while the wife becomes ever more complicated. For better or worse, this is not so much a book about their marriage; it is a book about the wife’s marriage. It would be interesting to read the other story to this marriage, to know more of the husband, the father — but Offill still makes it seem as if the wife’s version of the marriage is story enough and, perhaps, the only story that matters. The book calls to mind a proverb from Madagascar: Marriage is not a tight knot, but a slip knot.
