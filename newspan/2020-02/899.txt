This is a confusing time to be alive. Take this film, for instance. It’s a horror reboot and slight sendup of a television series that is best remembered by the parents of its target audience. “Fantasy Island” ran on ABC from 1977 to 1984; it was an anthology series in which guests at the title resort learned life lessons in down-market O. Henry scenarios demonstrating how careful one ought to be when wishing for things.
The film seems to pull imagery (like bleeding-eyed undead killers) from Euro-horror maestros like Jean Rollin and also cribs story elements from not one, but two different Tarkovsky classics (really). The sex and violence components, which are best served hot and lurid in exercises such as these, are here puréed into PG-13 pulp.
This is all interesting from a pro-am cinema semiotics perspective, but none of it is in the least bit scary. This, really, is what happens when you take all the wrong lessons out of film school.
Rated PG-13 for bland sex and violence stuff. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes.
