A whipsaw week of charged decisions by the Justice Department, some favored by the president and others not, has bewildered much of Washington.
WASHINGTON — When President Trump learned that the Justice Department was dropping a case against a former F.B.I. official whom he considered one of his longtime enemies, his immediate response was anger. As he flipped on the television Friday and watched how the story was being covered, that anger only mounted.
Mr. Trump’s first White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, issued similar rules in a Jan. 27, 2017, memo that prohibited White House officials from communicating with most Justice Department officials about “ongoing or contemplated cases.” Only the president, vice president or White House counsel was allowed to initiate such communications, Mr. McGahn wrote, and they must be directed to the attorney general or three other top Justice Department officials.
