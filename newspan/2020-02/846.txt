The music streaming giant wants more general audio content, and the website started by Bill Simmons has more than 30 podcasts.
Nearly four years after breaking away from a large company to run his own digital operation, Bill Simmons is going back into business with a corporate behemoth.
The Ringer, the website and podcasting network founded by Mr. Simmons in 2016, will soon become the property of Spotify, the companies said on Wednesday. The terms of the deal, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter, were not disclosed.
Mr. Simmons, a writer, a sports commentator, a podcaster and an internet entrepreneur, started The Ringer after he left ESPN in a bitter dispute. As an employee of the sports media giant, he founded the sports and culture website Grantland. He also had a hand in the creation of the network’s “30 for 30” documentary series.
ESPN did not renew his contract in 2015 and closed Grantland months later. The Ringer was originally on the digital platform Medium and switched to Vox Media under a partnership announced in 2017.
The site has a lineup of more than 30 podcasts, including “The Bill Simmons Podcast” and “The Rewatchables.” It publishes original articles daily and houses a video network, a film production division and a book imprint.
In addition to announcing the agreement to buy The Ringer, Spotify reported a 29 percent rise in paid subscribers for its audio streaming services in the fourth quarter of 2019, to 124 million, giving it a significant lead over its main rival, Apple.
The union representing Ringer employees, the Writers Guild of America, East, expressed concern about the deal when it was in negotiations, which came to light in a Jan. 17 article in The Journal.
“We anticipate a productive relationship with new management for all Ringer staff members: podcasters, writers, editors, illustrators, fact checkers, copy editors, social media editors, and video and audio producers,” the union said in a statement.
The site’s staff announced the union in August, and management voluntarily recognized it a few days later. In the months before the announcement of the Spotify deal, the union held three bargaining sessions. A union representative said on Wednesday that management had indicated that it would honor further bargaining sessions scheduled for late February, March and May.
Workers at Gimlet Media, a podcasting company based in Brooklyn, announced that they were forming a union about a month after Spotify bought the company last year. Gimlet has recognized the union, but the two sides have yet to agree on a contract.
