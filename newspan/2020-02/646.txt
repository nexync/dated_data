Corrections that appeared in print on Friday, Feb. 21, 2020.
A map with an article on Sunday about the philanthropic contributions of Michael R. Bloomberg misidentified the location of one recipient, EngenderHealth. It is based in Washington, D.C., not Vermont.
An article on Thursday about an increase in airline flight delays misstated part of the reason given by the trade group Airlines for America for tarmac delays last year. It said airport maintenance and construction work, not poor airport maintenance, was a factor.
A picture caption with an obituary on Dec. 21 about the high school football coach Herman Boone, using information from The Associated Press, misstated the year the photograph of him with the T.C. Williams High School football team was taken. It was 1977, not 1971. And the obituary misstated the position Mr. Boone held at E.J. Hayes High School in Williamston, N.C. He was head football coach, not assistant coach. This correction was delayed because a letter from a reader pointing out these errors was misdirected within The Times and reached the appropriate editors only recently.
An obituary on Tuesday about the author Charles Portis referred incorrectly to Indian Territory, where his novel “True Grit” was set. It was defined as “all of that part of the United States west of the Mississippi, and not within the states of Missouri and Louisiana, or the territory of Arkansas”; no part of it was in Arkansas. The obituary also mistakenly included one name on a list of Mr. Portis’s former colleagues at The New York Herald Tribune. Nora Ephron did not work there.
