A footnote in a 1992 scholarly article mentioned an 1800 list from Bedminster apparently showing a few women’s names. But that, it seemed, was it.
And more kept coming. So far, Dr. Micucci and the museum’s other researchers have located 18 poll lists from four townships from between 1797 and 1807, nine of which include women’s names.
On the 1801 Montgomery Township list, the name Ephraim Hagerman has the word “negro” next to it. He is also identified in contemporary tax records as “negro,” as are several other men whose names are also on the Montgomery list, but without any racial marker.
