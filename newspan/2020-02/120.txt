European finance ministers, meeting at the G20 in Riyadh, are pushing the United States for a global tax deal as a year-end deadline looms.
At a news conference on Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin declined to elaborate on specifically how his safe harbor proposal would work and he suggested that there was too much focus on that point of contention.
Even after meeting with Mr. Mnuchin over the weekend, Mr. Le Maire remained uncertain about the mechanism that the United States envisions to break the deadlock. In an interview, Mr. Le Maire said that he hoped that a compromise could be reached this year. Otherwise, he said, France would begin collecting the taxes.
“We won’t have any other choice but to put our taxation back into place,” he said.
