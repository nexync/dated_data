The Grammy-winning musician, a true believer in his hometown’s intoxicating energy, riffs on his favorite spots.
Oakland, known as “The Town” in local parlance, is often defined by its differences from San Francisco across the bay. But the city — birthplace of the Black Panther movement — is a bubbling caldron of creative energy worth exploring on its own. Xavier Amin Dphrepaulezz, better known as Fantastic Negrito, is an Oakland-based musician who sees himself as a bridge between Oakland’s past and present. From the early days of hip-hop and punk to the city’s current gentrification, he is a true believer in the city’s intoxicating energy.
“I embrace it, and I uphold it!” he says. Here, he shares his five favorite places.
Spending time in this vibrant, artist-filled enclave within Oakland’s Fruitvale neighborhood is one of Fantastic Negrito’s favorite ways to experience Oakland’s “history and culture of art galleries.” It’s particularly worth visiting on the second Friday of the month, when the diverse community comes together for the Jingletown and Alameda Art Walk.
