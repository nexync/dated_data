Students at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn talked about their education.
We often write about students and education, quoting students, but for this issue of Learning we wanted to hear from them directly. We went to Abraham Lincoln High School, which has nearly 2,000 students in grades nine through 12, and asked more than a dozen of them to answer the following questions: What would you change about your education? What are your education goals? What is the biggest challenge for you in terms of your education? Their answers have been edited and condensed.
