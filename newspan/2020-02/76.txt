The prime minister announced that he and his partner, Carrie Symonds, were expecting a child. It’s the first for her. For Johnson? Well, that’s not so clear.
Mr. Johnson will be the first prime minister since Tony Blair to have a child while living in 10 Downing Street. Mr. Blair and his wife, Cherie, had a son, Leo, while there in 2000. In 2010, three months after becoming prime minister, David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, had a daughter, Florence, while on a family vacation in Cornwall.
