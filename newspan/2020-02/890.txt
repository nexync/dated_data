America’s political divide is deeper than it has been in decades. Many people feel increasingly frustrated with politics. And many Democrats and Republicans say their views do not line up with their party’s on a number of issues. Some voters even say they feel politically homeless.
I am a national reporter covering Americans and their lives this election year, and I would like to talk to more people in the political middle. I believe this is an important, under-covered part of the electorate.
If you are a Republican, a Democrat or an independent — even if you don’t always vote — and feel that you don’t fit in politically, I would love to hear from you.
What is most frustrating to you about American politics today? How would you change the political landscape? Please tell me in the form below, and I may follow up with you in my reporting.
