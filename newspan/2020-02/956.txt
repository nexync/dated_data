Broeksmit’s suicide elevated his usefulness as a narrative prop, perhaps more than his role at Deutsche warranted. Enrich doggedly prowls the psychological shadows for clues about what might have driven him. He trails Broeksmit’s son, Val, who wasn’t close to his dad but who, after his death, embarks on a quest to find “answers” and to pin culpability on his father’s employer. Val gains access to his father’s email (and hacks into his mother’s credit cards) and shares the goods with journalists and investigators across Europe and America, often demanding money that he then spends on heroin and Oxy. This soap opera says much about the Broeksmits, less about Deutsche. To Enrich, the story shows that Wall Street lures good people “away from their moral and ethical principles.” However, he presents no evidence of Broeksmit acting immorally. He was, rather, a decent if imperfect banker who, as Enrich says, internalized his employer’s problems.
