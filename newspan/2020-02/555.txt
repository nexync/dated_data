She had a long career onstage and on film and TV. But she found her greatest fame late in life, as a stern housekeeper on a hit HBO series.
Lynn Cohen, the veteran actress best known for her role as Magda on the hit HBO series “Sex and the City,” died on Feb. 14 at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.
Magda first appeared in the show’s third season, in 2000. Ms. Cohen was supposed to appear in only one episode, “Attack of the Five Foot Ten Woman,” in which Magda memorably replaces Miranda’s vibrator with a statue of the Virgin Mary and later tells her that she’ll need to learn to cook if she ever wants a boyfriend.
Lynn Harriet Kay was born on Aug. 10, 1933, in Kansas City, Mo. Her father, Louis Kay, was a salesman; her mother, Bertha (Cornsweet) Kay, worked in retail.
In 2013, Ms. Cohen played Mags, an 80-year-old woman who volunteers to participate in the dystopian competition in “Hunger Games: Catching Fire.” Her many other film credits include Woody Allen’s “Manhattan Murder Mystery” (1993) and Steven Spielberg’s “Munich” (2005), in which she played Golda Meir.
