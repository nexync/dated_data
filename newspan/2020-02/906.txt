An article on Wednesday about the resignation of four prosecutors following the Justice Department’s intervention in the case against Roger J. Stone Jr. misstated the action that a prosecutor took on a memo supporting probation for Michael T. Flynn. Brandon L. Van Grack signed the memo; it is not the case that he did not sign it.
An obituary on Wednesday about Joseph Shabalala, the founder of the South African choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, referred incorrectly to the group’s current tour. It is continuing; it was not canceled when the group learned that Mr. Shabalala, who retired in 2014, had died.
