Her father, Jeff Shiffrin, loved watching his daughter win ski races, but he always said that wasn’t what life was about when raising a future champion.
Mikaela, then 19, was there too, and would soon be competing in the world championships, but as often happened at these things, I ended up hanging around with Jeff. As middle-aged dads of daughters, we had a lot more in common than I did with Mikaela, who had the Olympic gold medal and the freakish athletic skills, and is decades younger.
That night in Colorado, I told Jeff a story of how at a lunch a few months back, Mikaela, who had come to my New York office with a half-dozen others, had been the only one to offer to help me carry the trays of sandwiches and salads. When lunch was over, the gold medalist started clearing everyone’s plates and throwing them in the garbage. Again, she was the only one doing this.
