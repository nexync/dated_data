In an era of opioid addiction, wellness obsession and internet oversharing, stories of substance abuse are back.
A national opioid epidemic. Legal marijuana. Continual attempts to redefine problem drinking.
Is it any wonder that the addiction memoir (made modish in the 1940s and 1950s by Charles Jackson’s thinly veiled roman à clef, “The Lost Weekend,” and “Junky,” by William S. Burroughs; revived in the 1990s and 2000s with “Permanent Midnight,” by Jerry Stahl, “Drinking: A Love Story,” by Caroline Knapp, “Lit,” by Mary Karr, and “Night of the Gun,” by David Carr) is surging yet again?
