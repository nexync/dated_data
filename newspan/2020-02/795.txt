An article on Tuesday about racial identity in Puerto Rico misstated the location of Isla Verde, a popular tourist area in Puerto Rico. It is near San Juan, not in San Juan.
An article on Monday about the intense competition on the United States women’s national soccer team for Olympic roster spots misidentified one of the United States goal scorers in the game. In addition to Megan Rapinoe and Lindsey Horan, Lynn Williams — not Christen Press — scored.
An obituary on Sunday about the actor Orson Bean misidentified the Massachusetts high school from which he graduated in 1946. It was Cambridge High and Latin School — not Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, which was created by a merger of that school and the Rindge Technical School in 1977.
An obituary on Tuesday about the neuroscientist Bruce S. McEwen overstated the findings by Dr. McEwen and his research team in the 1960s on the effects of long-term stress on the brain. While his studies demonstrated, as the obituary correctly stated, that toxic stress atrophied neurons near the hippocampus, the brain’s memory and learning center, his research did not demonstrate that stress expanded neurons near the amygdala, the area of the brain that promotes vigilance toward threats; that discovery was made by others, including former collaborators with Dr. McEwen, although his laid the foundation for it.
An obituary on Sunday about Greta Beer, whose search for her father’s Swiss bank account helped force banks in Switzerland to pay compensation to Holocaust victims and their heirs, misstated the name of the city in Romania where she was born. It is Cernauti, not Cermauti.
An editorial on Monday about the Chinese military theft of personal information from the credit bureau Equifax misstated the developer of Apache Struts software. Apache Struts is an open source project of the Apache Struts Foundation, not a product of the software giant Adobe.
