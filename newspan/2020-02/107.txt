A judge has ordered that the city revoke the building permit for 200 Amsterdam Avenue.
What comes next is unclear. While further litigation would effectively postpone any disassembly of the tower, sales at the luxury condo would also be held up. Marketing is well underway for the 112 luxury apartments, and the most lucrative units are on the top floors — including a $21 million penthouse, which would likely be removed if the decision stands.
It is exceptionally rare in New York for a developer to have to remove completed floors from a building, but it has happened. In 1991, a developer was forced to reduce a 31-story building on East 96th Street to 19 stories.
Recently, the developers of a 30-story tower on the Upper East Side were forced to redesign elements of the building after community groups argued that its size exceeded local zoning limits.
The decision at 200 Amsterdam comes amid a wave of opposition to high-rise developments across the city, at a moment when the luxury real estate market is suffering from a glut of inventory.
Nearly half of new condo units in Manhattan that came to market after 2015 — 3,695 of 7,727 apartments — remain unsold, according to a December analysis of both closed sales and contracts by Nancy Packes Data Services, a real estate consultancy and database provider.
Even if the decision is upheld, partially deconstructing a tower of this size presents its own set of logistical quandaries: How much of the building violates the zoning law? How will the floors be removed? And what happens to units under contract on affected floors?
