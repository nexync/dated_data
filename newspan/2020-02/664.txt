Rebecca McCallum Herrigel and Corey Stephen Johnson were married Feb. 22 at the Delta Flight Museum in Atlanta. Candiss L. Howard, a friend of the bride’s family who is a judge at the Sandy Springs Municipal Court in Sandy Springs, Ga., and the Dunwoody Municipal Court in Dunwoody, Ga., officiated.
Ms. Herrigel, 31, is a senior account supervisor in Washington at Edelman, a public relations and marketing firm. She graduated from Trinity College in Hartford and received a master’s degree in political management from George Washington University.
She is the daughter of Victoria S. Aronow of Marietta, Ga., and David A. Herrigel of Atlanta. The bride’s father is a lawyer in private practice in Atlanta. Her mother is a circuit defender in Cobb County Superior Court in Marietta. The bride is the stepdaughter of Dr. Carol Lipinski and Marshall Duling.
Mr. Johnson, also 31, is an aviation sustainability consultant at C&S Engineers in Washington. He graduated summa cum laude from the University of New Hampshire and received a master of environmental management degree from Yale.
He is the son of Kathy L. Johnson and Steve R. Johnson of Amherst, N.H. His mother is the office manager at Clark-Wilkins Elementary School in Amherst. His father works in Nashua, N.H., as the director of global channels at Arista Networks, a computer networking company based in Santa Clara, Calif.
Ms. Herrigel, whose first love is soccer, and Mr. Johnson, whose first love is airplanes, met in 2014 through a mutual friend in Washington. Ms. Herrigel, who had to pull herself away from a men’s World Cup final after it went into overtime, was a bit late for one of their early dates — watching planes take off and land at Reagan National Airport while picnicking in Gravelly Point Park in Arlington County, Va.
