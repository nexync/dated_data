The virus could affect the global economy, the Federal Reserve head told Congress. He also signaled comfort with leaving interest rates unchanged.
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, warned lawmakers on Tuesday that the coronavirus epidemic sweeping China could pose broader economic risks, even as he signaled that the central bank was comfortable holding interest rates steady for now.
Mr. Powell added that “the Chinese government has obviously taken very strong measures” to contain the virus.
“I think he’s done the wrong thing,” the president added.
As Mr. Powell testified Tuesday, Mr. Trump commented on his performance on Twitter, seemingly blaming the Fed chair as stock prices drifted down. Prices later recovered, and it was unclear what had caused the minor wobble, which occurred amid developing news about the coronavirus and potential regulatory action involving technology companies.
Mr. Powell was asked about negative rates, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly pressed for in the United States. He said the Fed had chosen to use other tools to stimulate the economy in the last downturn, and would probably do so again in the next.
A good relationship with Congress could prove essential in the next recession. Interest rates have fallen across advanced economies as the population has aged, and productivity growth has slowed, which means that the Fed will likely have less room to cut borrowing costs to coax the economy back to life in future downturns.
The budget deficit topped $1 trillion in 2019, and the Congressional Budget Office expects trillion-dollar deficits for the next several years.
