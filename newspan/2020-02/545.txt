Authorities sealed off Wuhan, the Chinese city of 11 million at the center of the coronavirus outbreak. Residents told us how they are coping.
This is Wuhan, the city that officials say is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. We reached residents inside Wuhan, who have been cut off from the outside world for days, to find out how they are coping. They’re wearing masks to conceal part of their identities for fear of persecution for speaking out. A patient, who spoke to us by audio, told us about his struggle to receive treatment. Mr. Liu recovered at home, and is feeling better now. Some blame the government for mismanaging the situation … … but they remain hopeful as citizens step up to help.
