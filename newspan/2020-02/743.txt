Crime stories hold our attention for a reason — the promise of plot, the chance of violence, the high moral stakes and stark challenges to social norms, or sometimes just the intellectual fun of trying to solve a good mystery. We bring you a host of such stories this week, both in fiction and in non. The true stuff first: Sanam Maher’s “A Woman Like Her” delves into the phenomenon of honor killings through the story of a Pakistani social media star who was strangled for pushing her culture’s boundaries, while Emma Copley Eisenberg’s “The Third Rainbow Girl” looks at the way a small Appalachian town continues to be haunted by a double murder that took place there decades ago. In fiction, meanwhile, there’s a missing child in India (“Djinn Patrol on the Purple Line”), a White House intern who uncovers a plot to assassinate the president (“Deep State”), a psychiatrist’s creepy new patient (“Mr. Nobody”) and the latest entry in Joe Ide’s IQ series of detective novels (“Hi Five”).
Outside the world of crime, the stakes are just as high — or even higher, in the case of “The Bomb,” Fred Kaplan’s engaging new history of nuclear strategy and warfare. Back to fiction, our other recommendations this week include a story collection about women at various stages of life (“Adults and Other Children”), a novel about a young Englishwoman questioning her place in the world (“Saltwater”) and a novel about an Indian woman who discovers a family she never knew she had (“Small Days and Nights”).
