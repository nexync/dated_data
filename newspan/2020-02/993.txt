Jen Pelka, an owner of the Riddler, now has a new wine brand, Une Femme, with a premier cru brut Champagne.
Jen Pelka, an owner of the Riddler in the West Village, has long wanted to serve her own Champagne. She finally found a small grower-producer in France, and now, with her brother, Zach Pelka, she’s got a Champagne that’s exclusively hers.  Her brand is Une Femme and includes the Juliette, a premier cru brut, and soon be joined by the Callie, a rosé California sparkler. The Juliette is almost like a sparkling Chablis, floral and slightly herbaceous with sleek minerality and pearly carbonation, a wine to pour with seafood and fried chicken. It is sold retail and is served at her Riddler locations in New York and San Francisco.
