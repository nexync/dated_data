A look at one of the entries from last week’s puzzles that stumped our solvers.
The XFL is a professional football league that was started in 2001 by the World Wrestling Federation and NBC. It was intended to be an alternative to the N.F.L., with a fun and “fans first” spirit.
It lasted only one season before being shuttered, but was resurrected in 2019. Vince McMahon, chairman and C.E.O. of World Wrestling Entertainment, spearheaded the original league and retained control of the XFL brand after it failed. McMahon is the driving force behind the revamped league.
The new XFL teams are the D.C. Defenders, Dallas Renegades, Houston Roughnecks, Los Angeles Wildcats, New York Guardians, St. Louis BattleHawks, Seattle Dragons and Tampa Bay Vipers.
Mr. McMahon has drawn fire from some on social media because of new behavioral rules that players are expected to follow. “Taking a knee” in protest is not allowed, and players will not be hired if they have a criminal background.
The first season of the new XFL began in February 2020.
