The butcher shop will now cook steaks to order at its larger incarnation in the food hall.
Though it’s now on the lower level, Dickson’s Farmstand Meats’ move from the main floor of Chelsea Market was driven by a desire for increased space. Jake Dickson now has an expanded kitchen and more seating to meet the demand from customers who could not wait to tuck into a roast beef sandwich. There are more prepared foods, and Mr. Dickson has hired a chef, Adam Baumgart, a former executive chef at Diner and Houseman. Rotisserie chickens and a long rotating list of assorted skewers — like beef salami, beef heart, pork belly and pig’s face roulade — are ready to eat or to take home. Steaks and chops are sold, but they’re also cooked to order, served with fries and greens for market price, plus a $12.50 surcharge.
