Join us on Feb. 26 as The Learning Network explains how our Student Editorial Contest is an excellent opportunity to sharpen students’ argumentative writing skills.
Register here for our free webinar on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2020 at 4 p.m. Eastern Time.
Do your students enjoy discussion and debate? Are you looking for ways to channel their opinions into meaningful writing? Are you searching for an authentic audience to read their work?
Each year, The Learning Network’s Editorial Contest provides students a platform to write short, evidence-based persuasive essays like the editorials The New York Times publishes every day. Over 10,000 students participate. Will yours?
We know that evidence-based argumentative writing is an important component of middle and high school education. This contest serves as a perfect real-world example of this genre. And, students have the chance to share their opinions with our judges — and, if they’re one of dozens of winners and runners-up, with the world.
Leave you with ideas and resources you can implement with your own students right away.
