The director Cathy Yan narrates a sequence from her film starring Margot Robbie.
Roller skating in an action scene? Difficult. Roller skating in an action scene while on a rotating carousel? Good luck with that.
Margot Robbie pulls off the stunt as Harley Quinn in “Birds of Prey.” Though the climactic moment, which takes place in a funhouse, wasn’t just a challenging set piece for Robbie. Other cast members, including Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Ella Jay Basco and Rosie Perez, performed many of their own stunts in a sequence that required months of training and preparation. That included leaping on bouncy props and executing complex fight choreography on that rotating set.
In this video, the director Cathy Yan further discusses the scene’s levels of difficulty and how the shots were organized. For one, she and her team came up with a clever way to maintain continuity when shooting on a spinning set with a wildly colorful background.
