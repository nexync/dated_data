Mike Bloomberg has contracted some of the biggest meme-makers on the internet to post sponsored content on Instagram promoting his presidential campaign.
The Bloomberg campaign is working with Meme 2020, a new company formed by some of the people behind extremely influential accounts.
The campaign, which began this week, has already placed sponsored posts on Instagram accounts including @GrapeJuiceBoys, a meme page with more than 2.7 million followers; Jerry Media’s own most popular account, with more than 13.3 million followers; and @Tank.Sinatra, a member with more than 2.3 million followers.
The accounts all posted Bloomberg campaign ads in the form of fake direct messages from the candidate.
“What do you think of this one?” the ad says, referring to a photo of Bernie Sanders that has become a meme in recent weeks.
George Resch, a director of influencer marketing at Brandfire and founder of @Tank.Sinatra, serves as Meme 2020’s primary liaison with the meme community.
Mr. Resch has posted two ads so far on behalf of the campaign. On Sunday, he posted an ad in which a fake direct message from Mr. Bloomberg asks Mr. Resch to make him look “cool” for the Democratic primary.
Evan Reeves, a creative director for Jerry Media, was brought in as head of creative to devise an unconventional campaign, and to build a self-aware ironic character around Mr. Bloomberg.
Other influencers have been quick to praise the campaign. “Best advert ever,” commented Chris Burkard, a travel influencer who has more than 3.5 million followers. “So good,” commented Jason Strauss, a partner at the Tao Group.
Memers involved with Meme 2020 include: @MyTherapistSays, @WhitePeopleHumor, @TheFunnyIntrovert, @KaleSalad, @Sonny5ideUp, @Tank.Sinatra, @ShitheadSteve, @adam.the.creator, @moistbudda, @MrsDowJones, @TrashCanPaul, @cohmedy, @NeatDad, @FourTwenty, @GolfersDoingThings, @DrGrayFang, @MiddleClassFancy and @DoYouEvenLift.
Together, the collective has an audience of more than 60 million followers.
The campaign recently announced it had hired Eric Kuhn, who made a name for himself as Hollywood’s first “social media agent,” representing digital talent at United Talent Agency.
Last week, The Daily Beast reported that the Bloomberg campaign was offering social media influencers $150 to create content in support of Mr. Bloomberg through Tribe, a “branded content marketplace” that connects social-media influencers with brands.
Other candidates, like Andrew Yang, who announced the end of his campaign this week, have been able to make a splash on social media by appealing to influential YouTubers and memers. Mr. Sanders has successfully secured endorsements from popular internet figures with large followings such as the podcaster Joe Rogan and the YouTuber Ethan Klein. Niche meme communities like Da Share Zone and NUMTOT have also come out in support of Mr. Sanders.
After several large Instagram memers became aware on Wednesday of Mr. Bloomberg’s influencer campaign, many expressed an interest in creating sponsored posts for him. The campaign so far has seemed amenable. “We want to work with creators and we’ve never been shy about paying people for creative work,” the aide said.
