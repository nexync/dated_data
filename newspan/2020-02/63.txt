“Please don’t surrender the tradition of daily editorials by the editorial board,” a reader writes.
I was not happy to find a giant hole in my newspaper on Wednesday. Please don’t surrender the tradition of daily editorials by the editorial board.
If the editorial board is overworked, lacks ideas or needs more time to report on issues, give it the resources it needs. Maybe you can lighten its load by adding more people to the board.
I was put off by the editors’ note (print edition, editorial page, Feb. 26) explaining the changes. It’s absurd to think that readers want to hear from the board only on “matters of great significance.” Yikes! That makes the board sound so special.
I thought that the board was made up of talented journalists who worked hard and earned a coveted spot at the newspaper. I value the collective opinion of the editorial board. I want to hear from the editorial board every day on all manner of topics.
