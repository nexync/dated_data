BAD BLOOD: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup, by John Carreyrou. (Vintage, 341 pp., $16.95.) Carreyrou, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, recounts how Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and C.E.O. of Theranos, hoodwinked investors, employees and the public into believing in the $9 billion company’s faulty technology for testing blood. The book tells the story “virtually to perfection,” Roger Lowenstein wrote here.
ARISTOTLE’S WAY: How Ancient Wisdom Can Change Your Life, by Edith Hall. (Penguin, 254 pp., $17.) Hall, a professor of classics at King’s College London, makes the case that practicing the virtue and moderation central to the philosophy of Aristotle is the key to lasting happiness in the modern world. “It sounds platitudinous enough, but it isn’t, thanks to Hall’s tight yet modest prose,” our reviewer, John Kaag, wrote.
CHEER UP, MR WIDDICOMBE, by Evan James. (Washington Square Press/Atria, 277 pp., $16.) This debut is a comedy of manners about an upper-middle-class family who, seeking a more relaxing and fun lifestyle, moves from San Francisco to Puget Sound, where they’re joined by a screenwriter and a self-help guru. The novel “bubbles with self-realizations,” our reviewer, Cherise Wolas, wrote.
