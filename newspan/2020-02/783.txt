A boy in Occupied France, with eyes wide open, must choose what to say about what he sees.
Debates persist about the appropriate ways to depict World War II onscreen, but “stodgily familiar,” which describes “Waiting for Anya,” is probably not the most historically sensitive mode.
This child’s-eye view of Occupied France is set in a village in the Pyrenees, where, at the outset, Jo (Noah Schnapp), a shepherd’s son, spots a bear and alerts adults. The bear, a mother, is killed (the better to be used as a metaphor).
Soon after, Jo discovers that at a nearby farm, a woman (Anjelica Huston) is hiding a Jewish man (Frederick Schmidt) and a growing number of children. His ability to keep that secret, even while he goes eagle-watching with a Nazi corporal (Thomas Kretschmann), is a test of mettle.
“Waiting for Anya” is not so sentimental that it imagines every character can escape death. But it has little use for complexity. If there are Nazi collaborators among the French here, for instance, they don’t have notable speaking parts. And making the most prominent German officer sympathetic to saving Jewish children avoids reckoning with the depths of the Third Reich’s evils.
Based on a novel by Michael Morpugo (author of “War Horse”), this film suffers from other deficits of verisimilitude. Characters speak English with such strong accents it’s odd that the director, Ben Cookson, didn’t opt for French and German. And as harrowing as Jo’s ordeal may be, the movie doesn’t fail to provide the obligatory uplift.
