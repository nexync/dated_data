On abortion, gun rights and more, the future could be determined by how fully the court’s new conservative majority embraces a rigid understanding of the Constitution.
Later, the Supreme Court established other underpinnings for the right to access abortion. In the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, three justices appointed by Republican presidents — Kennedy, Sandra Day O’Connor and David Souter — devised a compromise that allowed the states to regulate Roe, but only if they did not impose an “undue burden” on women seeking abortions. Returning to the 14th Amendment, the justices wrote: “The controlling word in the cases before us is ‘liberty.'” The court invoked gender equality, saying that the right to decide whether and when to have a child is essential to a woman’s ability “to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation.” As Linda Greenhouse and Reva Siegel wrote in the 2019 book “Reproductive Rights and Justice Stories,” “Respect for the equal citizenship of women appears centrally in the opinion.” It took 20 years, and perhaps a female justice, but the court saw a direct connection between reproductive freedom and equality. The current conservative majority, however, may undo it.
