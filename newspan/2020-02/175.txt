Squirting dye into the mini Mississippi shows how the water flows around a proposed diversion.
Mr. Schwartz, a climate reporter, has reported on Louisiana coastal issues since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
Patterns of sediment in the model show how the planned diversion would move sand out of the river and into the basin.
The squeeze bottle of dye has a long nozzle so that a line of color can be spread across the moving water.
The gates on the diversion channel allow operators to limit or stop the fresh water flowing out of the Mississippi.
As the water from the river enters the diversion, it speeds up and carries sand away, so the patterns of sediment disappear.
