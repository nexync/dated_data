Television|How Much Watching Time Do You Have This Weekend?
Fun choices abound this Valentine’s Day weekend, especially for those who find history sexy.
No matter how much free time you have this weekend, we have TV recommendations for you. Come back every week for new suggestions on what to watch.
The flowers, the cards, the professing of feelings — blame England, whence these traditions came. Lucy Worsley traces the history of romance, which on this week’s episode includes medieval chivalry but also love letters between average Victorian-era folks, the apparent codes with bouquets and the sublimated sexiness of séances. It’s not all lovey-dovey, either; one lost tradition is that of a “vinegar Valentine,” which was a mean card you sent to someone you didn’t like. Take that, subtweets.
When to watch: Sunday at 10 p.m., on Epix.
Fans of the Slate podcast “Slow Burn” might not feel a need to double dip, but those new to its precise, engrossing exploration of Watergate will have plenty to dig into in this new six-episode series. The first episode tells the story of Martha Mitchell, whose early warnings of corruption were ignored — and whose reputation was besmirched because of her true assertions. Much about today’s political climate is unusual, but pettiness and criminality are nothing new.
The second season of this British coming-of-age show is now streaming, and Netflix just renewed it for a third season, which is great news for anyone who likes the earnest side of teen sex comedies.  In addition to being a secret sweetheart of a series, “Sex Education” has some of my favorite production and costume design — retro and quirky, with an earthy color pallette and a fully developed sense of place.
