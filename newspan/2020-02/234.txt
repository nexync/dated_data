Just hours after Lauren Schneider and Lawrence Moss were married on Jan. 28 at Sandals South Coast, a resort in Whitehouse, Jamaica, they received phone calls from many friends and family who couldn’t attend.
They weren’t congratulatory calls. They were calls of concern.
A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck at 2:10 p.m. in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and eastern Cuba, according to an Associated Press report from Havana. It was felt from Mexico to Florida and beyond.
The bride, the founder and president of Broadway Fantasy Camp, an entertainment agency in New York that allows theater enthusiasts to perform alongside theater professionals on Broadway stages, and the groom, a lawyer in Chicago, met 20 years ago in Lake Delton, Wis., at the bat mitzvah of a mutual friend’s daughter.
The couple said that getting married would not change their living arrangement.
■ The day before their Jan. 28 wedding ceremony in Jamaica, the couple, in the company of their dive master, Alton Williams, staged an underwater ceremony. On Feb. 2, Rabbi Danny Moss and Rabbi Susan Landau Moss are to lead a traditional Jewish ceremony on the beach in Hollywood, Fla.
■ Ms. Schneider graduated from the University of Texas at Austin. She is the daughter of Charlotte Schneider of St. Louis, and the late Irvin Schneider.
■ Mr. Moss graduated from Columbia and received a law degree from the University of Chicago. He also received a master’s degree in Jewish history from the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. He is a son of the late Barbara J. Moss and the late Henry S. Moss, who both lived in Glenview, Ill.
