A fraught moment for a newsroom that, its editor in chief says, will not do in-depth investigations of Mike Bloomberg or any other Democrats running for president.

That is the message roughly 2,700 journalists at Bloomberg L.P., the financial data company owned in large part by Michael Bloomberg, received on Sunday morning after Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, formally announced his candidacy for president as a Democrat.
But, the memo said, Bloomberg’s outlets, which also include Bloomberg Businessweek and several industry-specific sites, will not do in-depth investigations of Mr. Bloomberg — or any of his Democratic rivals.
Mr. Micklethwait also said that several journalists in the opinion section would take leaves of absences to join Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign. They include Timothy L. O’Brien, the executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion, and David Shipley, the senior executive editor. Mr. Shipley was previously an editor at The New York Times opinion section, and Mr. O’Brien, also a former Times editor and reporter, is known for his 2005 biography of President Trump. The section’s unsigned editorials will go on hiatus, the memo said, and a note on the Bloomberg Opinion website said it would not accept outside op-ed articles about the campaign.
MSNBC also confirmed that Mr. O’Brien would no longer be a network contributor while he is working on the Bloomberg campaign.
