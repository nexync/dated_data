The killings of six children and their three mothers burst the illusion that only criminals fall victim to Mexico’s gang-fueled violence.
Funeral services for some of the victims began on Thursday in La Mora, where the families make up an independent Mormon fundamentalist community that is not affiliated with the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Members of the family were still questioning the government’s narrative of the attack.
Officials and investigators have said that the shooting caused Mrs. Miller’s vehicle to blow up, incinerating her and four of her children with a heat so intense that there was little left but charred bone, the vehicle’s gray husk and hardened pools of chrome melted from the blaze.
