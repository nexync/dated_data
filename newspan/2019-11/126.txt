Joe Biden leads with black voters, and Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are making better inroads with younger ones than Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. In interviews, voters rejected the idea that racial representation equated to change.
Mr. Biden, who held events in Atlanta and South Carolina after last week’s debate, has made his support from black voters, and the Southern mayors who govern them, a central talking point in his electoral pitch.
At the debate on Wednesday, both candidates pitched themselves as best equipped to rebuild the “Obama coalition,” a subtle dig at moderate candidates like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who have impressed white moderates but have amassed almost no support among black ones.
