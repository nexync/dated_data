The acclaimed biographer Edmund Morris died earlier this year, at 78, before he could see the publication of his new book, “Edison,” about the brilliant and prolific inventor. David Oshinsky, who reviewed the biography for us, visits the podcast this week to discuss Morris and Edison.
Also this week, Jeffrey Brown of PBS joins us to discuss the latest pick for Now Read This, a book club from “PBS NewsHour” and The New York Times; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Gregory Cowles, Andrew LaVallee and John Williams talk about what people are reading. Pamela Paul is the host.
