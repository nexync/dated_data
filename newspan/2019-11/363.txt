Hedging its bets, the manhunt movie “21 Bridges” both flatters and reviles the police. On the one hand, its somber hero, a remorseless homicide detective named Davis (Chadwick Boseman), is the closest thing the N.Y.P.D. has to a perp whisperer. On the other, Davis manages to shoot almost one suspect a month. Unapologetic about his kill rate, he explains to Internal Affairs that they all deserved their fates, so let’s move on, shall we?
Davis’s trigger finger — and a citywide police conspiracy — will be unduly tested when a cocaine heist goes awry and the thieves (Stephan James and Taylor Kitsch) escape by slaughtering eight police officers. Springing into action, Davis orders a complete blockade of Manhattan; with no way off the island, he and his blue army have just one night to catch the killers before the city implodes. Start the clock!
All else aside, the bullet budget for “21 Bridges” must have been off the charts. Spraying what seems like several thousand rounds of ammunition, this sturdy thriller (the big-screen feature debut of the director Brian Kirk) has no patience for nuance. It’s a big, blunt, battering ram of a movie, but it’s not dumb: The stunts are sharply executed, the actors (including Sienna Miller and J.K. Simmons) unimpeachable and Paul Cameron’s lively camera turns the streets of Philadelphia into a credible-enough Manhattan. The dialogue might be boilerplate (“You wear that badge, I got your back!”), but, let’s face it, if any of its patrons are crestfallen, it won’t be because of its lack of ten-dollar words.
Rated R for cocaine and carnage. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes.
