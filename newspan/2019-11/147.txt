Samples of lung fluid from patients with the mysterious illness led to a breakthrough in finding a possible cause. More than 2,000 people have been sickened, many from illicit marijuana-based products.
Thousands of people have been sickened by lung illnesses linked to vaping, most by using THC products.
Additional fatal cases are being investigated, she added. The death count will probably go up.
Because there is still uncertainty about what is causing the illness, the C.D.C. is continuing to urge people to avoid vaping anything, including e-cigarettes.
Because of year-over-year spikes in the use of e-cigarettes among minors, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to soon announce measures that could involve banning most flavored e-cigarettes, including mint. Prohibiting menthol had been mentioned earlier, but the vaping and tobacco industries have intensively lobbied the White House and lawmakers against such a broad ban given that traditional menthol cigarettes remain on the market.
On Thursday, Juul Labs, the nation’s largest seller of e-cigarettes, took a step ahead of the anticipated flavor ban and announced that it would discontinue sales of mint-flavored pods, after the latest national surveys showed that teenagers cited fruit and mint as their favorites.
But an aide to President Trump suggested earlier this week that vape shops might somehow be exempted from restrictions. And on Friday, he noted that the industry had created a lot of jobs.
Mr. Trump said an announcement to protect young people would be made next week and would include a proposal to raise the age limit for sales of e-cigarettes to “21 or so.” Federal law now sets a minimum age of 18 to buy both cigarettes and e-cigarettes, although about one-third of states have raised the age to 21. There is bipartisan support for such a move, which would require an act of Congress.
