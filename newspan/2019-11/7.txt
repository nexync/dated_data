Once a group has been designated as a terrorist organization, it is illegal for people in the United States to knowingly provide support for it, and its members are barred from entering the country. Financial institutions are also forbidden from doing business with the organization.
The designation would not only have an impact on the bilateral strategy to combat narcotrafficking, but could also have “very broad and brutal political, diplomatic, financial, economic and commercial consequences,” he said in an interview on Milenio Televisión, a Mexican network.
It would also have the political effect of reinforcing “this narrative of Mexico as a threat to the national security of the United States,” Mr. Sarukhán said, noting that the timing coincided with the start of the presidential campaign.
“It’s something that really can be very, very, very disruptive for the bilateral relationship,” he said.
The interview between Mr. Trump and Mr. O’Reilly that was posted online on Tuesday evening was a clip from a longer conversation between the two. Mr. O’Reilly said that the full interview would be available to people who bought a premium membership to his personal website.
