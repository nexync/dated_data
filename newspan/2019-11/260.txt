The singing rapper’s blockbuster album has topped the chart five nonconsecutive times, the most since Drake.
After making room for Kanye West, Post Malone is back at No. 1.
With its fifth nonconsecutive week atop the Billboard 200 chart, “Hollywood’s Bleeding,” the third album by the 24-year-old singing rapper, becomes the first release since “Scorpion” by Drake to spend that many weeks as the top seller.
In its ninth week out, Post Malone’s “Hollywood’s Bleeding” totaled an additional 78,000 album-equivalent units, including 92 million streams and 7,000 in traditional sales, according to Nielsen, returning to the pinnacle after a modest sales week that was low on big-name releases. The highest debut was “Wildcard” by the country singer Miranda Lambert, which sold 53,000 units, combining 10 million streams and 44,000 in sales, and came in at No. 4.
Post Malone, who has been a near-constant presence near the top of the album and singles charts for years with hits like “Circles,” “Sunflower” and “Rockstar,” stormed Billboard anew in September, when he scored the year’s largest one-week streaming total (365 million). After three straight weeks at No. 1, Post Malone made way for chart-toppers by DaBaby, SuperM and YoungBoy Never Broke Again before regaining No. 1 thanks to consistent streaming numbers.
Last week, West’s gospel-heavy “Jesus Is King” debuted on the top of the Billboard 200, but its activity fell 73 percent in week two, putting it at No. 2 with 72,000 units sold, including another 67 million streams. The rest of the Top 5 was also filled by streaming favorites: “AI YoungBoy 2” by YoungBoy Never Broke Again moved up one spot to No. 3 (83 million streams), while “Over It” by the R&B singer Summer Walker held steady at No. 5 with 69 million streams.
