The first lady, who was speaking at an event for youth opioids awareness, rarely elicits such a visceral crowd reaction on her own.
WASHINGTON — Melania Trump was booed by a roomful of students in Baltimore on Tuesday when she took the stage to give a speech about youth opioid use, one of the pillars of her “Be Best” initiative.
A vocal crowd of middle school and high school students erupted in a mix of loud boos and some cheers as the first lady strode across the stage at the B’More Youth Summit on Opioid Awareness.
Mr. Trump has visited Baltimore once since then, when he went to town to address a Republican retreat at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront Hotel. But Mrs. Trump’s visit to the city did not have the benefit of an audience full of political allies.
Mrs. Trump has faced loud, negative crowd reactions attending events with her husband — the Trumps were loudly booed last month at the World Series in Washington, for example — but Mrs. Trump rarely elicits such a visceral crowd reaction on her own. She has participated in a number of events related to opioid abuse among young people, including visiting centers for at-risk youth, but many of those events were in front of smaller, more welcoming audiences.
But she is not the first member of the Trump family to find herself trapped in front of an unfriendly audience.
