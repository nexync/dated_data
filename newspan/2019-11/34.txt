The Times will have live elections results for the Louisiana governor’s race and other contests on Saturday, starting at 9 p.m. Eastern. They’ll include detailed maps showing the results by voting precinct.
Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana, a Democrat, faces a challenge from Eddie Rispone, a Republican and a Baton Rouge businessman who has made his campaign largely about aligning himself with President Trump and his policies.
Saturday’s election will be a test of Mr. Trump’s influence with voters, and the president held another rally for Mr. Rispone on Thursday night.
About 490,000 people in the state have already voted early, which is about 100,000 more early votes than were cast in last month’s nonpartisan primary. Mr. Edwards received 47 percent of the vote in the primary, while his three Republican opponents together received 52 percent of the vote.
Polls will be open from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, with first results expected shortly afterward. Other races include secretary of state and a seat on the state Supreme Court.
