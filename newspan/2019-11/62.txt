As fellow service members searched for an airman who fell from a plane into the Gulf of Mexico, they confronted the wrenching decision to switch their aim from rescue to recovery.
Rescue teams started from the spot where he was believed to have fallen on Tuesday, about four miles offshore between Fort Walton Beach and Pensacola. The Coast Guard dispatched three types of aircraft over the course of the search, along with several boats. Army Special Forces joined the search as well.
Bad weather was not a factor in the search for Sergeant Condiff, and the water temperatures near Fort Walton Beach were around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. But even in fairly warm water, hypothermia can set in when a person is immersed for a long time. “Any water that is colder than your core body temperature will eventually cause hypothermia,” Chief Jorgensen said.
The Coast Guard can base its decision in part on computer software that calculates the probability of survival for a given temperature and time. The service’s search and rescue manual notes that when a person’s core body temperature falls to 82.4 degrees, he or she is expected to lose consciousness.
The sergeant was taking part in low-level parachute training over a drop zone on one of the nearly two-mile-long runways at Hurlburt when he made “an unplanned parachute departure” from the aircraft, an MC-130H Combat Talon II plane, when it was over the Gulf of Mexico, according to the Air Force.
