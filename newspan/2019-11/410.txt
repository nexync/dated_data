Menopausal women who didnâ€™t get enough sleep were at increased risk of osteoporosis.
Sleeping too little may increase the risk for osteoporosis.
A study of menopausal women has found that sleeping less than five hours a night is associated with significantly increased low bone mineral density. The report, in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, compared 1,080 women who slept less than five hours with 4,025 who slept the recommended seven hours.
Using bone scans, they found that after adjusting for other factors, women who slept less than five hours had significantly lower bone mineral density and higher odds of osteoporosis at the hip, spine and total body.
The participants were generally healthy, and the study controlled for age, menopausal symptoms, physical activity and other factors. Still, the authors note this observational study does not prove that short sleep causes osteoporosis, only that the two are linked. It is possible, for example, that lower bone mineral density may be associated with other conditions that influence sleep behavior.
