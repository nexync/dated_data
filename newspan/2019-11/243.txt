A powerful storm is cutting across the country from Colorado to the Great Lakes, disrupting flights and dumping snow. Another threatens to bring hurricane-force winds to the West Coast.
Almost 500 flights were canceled to and from Denver International Airport beginning late on Monday, and hundreds of passengers were stranded at the airport overnight, as nearly a foot of snow fell on the Denver area by Tuesday morning. A number of airlines, including American, Southwest and Delta, issued travel waivers, allowing passengers to change their flights without incurring fees.
Rae Conlon, one of the many travelers in Denver who were trying to get home for the holiday, said she hoped to get to Cleveland in time for her familyâ€™s annual Thanksgiving bake-off. But with severe winter weather advisories posted across the Midwest, she was in limbo on Tuesday, waiting to hear whether her flight would even take off.
Interstate 70, a major east-west highway, was closed in both directions near Denver on Tuesday.
The University of South Dakota, University of Wyoming and several colleges in the Minneapolis area canceled classes for the day to give students an early start on holiday travel. With snow blanketing Colorado, a number of local and state government offices there also shut down.
