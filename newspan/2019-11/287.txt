President Trump, in an economic address in New York, said his policies have fueled America’s growth but gave little indication that a breakthrough in China trade talks was imminent.
We have ended the war on American workers. We have stopped the assault on American industry, and we have launched an economic boom the likes of which we have never seen before. The S&amp;P 500 is up over 45 percent. The Dow Jones is up over 50 percent, and the NASDAQ is up 60 percent — slightly more. [applause] And if we had a Federal Reserve that worked with us, you could have added another 25 percent to each one of those numbers, I guarantee you that. That doesn’t happen — but we all make mistakes don’t we? Since China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization in 2001, no one has manipulated numbers better or taken advantage of the United States more — and I won’t use this word “cheated.” I will not say the word “cheated,” but nobody’s cheated better than China. But I will not say that — we’ll say that off the record, O.K.? They are dying to make a deal. We’re the ones that are deciding whether or not we want to make a deal. We’re close. A significant, Phase 1 trade deal with China could happen, could happen soon. But we will only accept a deal if it’s good for the United States and our workers and our great companies.
