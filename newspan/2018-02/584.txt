Crystal meth has been flooding across Asia and Australia. Now it’s doing the same in the U.S.

Hundreds of millions of Chinese travel home ahead of the Lunar New Year. That includes Shanshan, a 7-year-old girl who grew up in Beijing, and whose family has rural roots.

Today marks the start of the Year of the Dog, the latest turn in the 12-year lunar zodiac cycle.
The phrase “Lunar New Year” is sometimes used interchangeably with “Chinese New Year,” but there are variations in how the holiday is celebrated around Asia.
In Vietnam, a type of rice cake called banh chung is made specially for the holiday and is deeply intertwined with nationalist myths and ancestor-worship customs.
Vietnam’s lunar zodiac cycle also differs slightly from China’s: It has a cat and a water buffalo instead of a rabbit and an ox. Some historians say that’s a linguistic quirk tied to China’s 1,000-year imperial occupation of Vietnam, its southern neighbor.
Vietnam’s next Year of the Cat falls in 2023.
The last time around, the owner of a “pet hotel” in the capital, Hanoi, told Reuters that the cat was an appropriate cosmic choice because it helps to offset the dog, its natural enemy.
“This expresses a balance of yin and yang in the cosmos that is more complete, that better unifies the contradictions, and so it is richer and better to have the cat,” he said.
