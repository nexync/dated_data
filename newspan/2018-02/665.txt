In his review of Rob Riemen’s “To Fight Against This Age: On Fascism and Humanism” (Feb. 4), Damon Linker’s implication that “the love of one’s own” has always reduced “citizenship” to a relatively small group is surely mistaken. While the concept of “one’s own” implies limitation, it just as certainly has expanded and shrunk over time, and it may well be that the European Union and the United Nations (let alone the United States), with all their setbacks and faults, illustrate by their very names the expansion of our view of the human family.
In his review of Rob Riemen’s book, Damon Linker does not think that those threatening the established order (including Trump, who scowls and juts his jaw in an attempt to look like Churchill, but ends up looking like a dime-store Mussolini) are fascists because they lack “a uniform, galvanizing ideology.” That is his definition, but ethnic nationalist demagogues offering simplistic solutions based on blaming the other for all that ails society can also be defined as fascists. Anyway, evil is evil and quibbling about nomenclature is a waste of energy. Linker also evidently believes that “the love of one’s own” is incompatible with the “glories of European high culture.” What rot. We can love our own and work for a world that contains “truth, goodness, beauty, friendship, justice, compassion and wisdom” at the same time. To “love one’s own” does not mean hatred of everyone else.
