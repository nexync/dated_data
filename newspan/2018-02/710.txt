Made In, a cookware brand thatâ€™s been on the market since September, has developed a new saucier in response to consumer demand. The wide, generous saucepan has a rounded profile to make stirring and whisking a custard, hollandaise or a risotto a breeze. Like the rest of the line, it is produced in the United States and made of five-ply metal: aluminum for conductivity and stainless steel for practicality. The saucier is compatible with induction cooktops, and its long handle stays cool. Made In sells only directly to consumers, so the price-quality ratio is very positive, often half the price of some name brands in stores: Made In, three-quart saucier, $85 without lid, $99 with lid, madeincookware.com.
