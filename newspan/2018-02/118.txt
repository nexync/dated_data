Two developers, the Related Companies and Vornado Realty Trust, are making a similar bet on the James A. Farley Building in Manhattan, a building completed in 1913 that features a facade with Corinthian-style columns along one side. Across Eighth Avenue from Pennsylvania Station, the property will be turned into a train hall named after Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, who died in 2003.
In a former two-story warehouse on the property, Lovett wants to create spaces for shops, artists and food purveyors on the ground level and office areas geared toward creative companies on the second floor. The old five-story office component is slated for a hotel.
Developers have reimagined postal buildings into new uses for years. Completed projects include a prominent building that dates to 1884 in downtown St. Louis and the Old Post Office in Washington, which President Trump’s real estate company leased in 2013 from the General Services Administration and converted into a hotel.
Over its last seven fiscal years, the agency has sold an average of 32 properties annually, according to its financial statements and reports. Sales can be contentious. In some cases, communities have fought to ensure buildings remain in public hands and open to serve customers. The agency has also faced criticism for selling buildings with historic elements.
Not every postal facility has a second life. The service’s distribution center near downtown Portland, Ore., is slated for demolition under plans by a local economic development agency, Prosper Portland.
