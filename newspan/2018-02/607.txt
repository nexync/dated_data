PARKLAND, Fla. — For the latest on the Florida school shooting, read Friday’s live updates.
David Hogg stood in the Florida sun on Thursday, not far from his now shuttered school, and described the events of the day before.
Mr. Hogg, 17, a lanky senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the student news director there, was in his environmental science class when a single shot rang out, echoing down the hallways.
His teacher pulled the door shut, but soon the fire alarm began to blare. Then, he said, came the sound of thousands of student footsteps, and Mr. Hogg and his classmates raced out the door, joining a giant wave of teenagers.
Then the school chef opened a door to her office, Mr. Hogg said, and hurried the teenagers in — first 10, then 20, then some 30 or 40 students crowded in the office.  And then students turned to their phones, and began the horrifying experience of watching a school shooting unfold at their own school — through the news apps on their phones.
While they were hiding, Mr. Hogg proceeded to interview his classmates on camera about their beliefs on gun policy.
Mr. Hogg’s younger sister, 14, was also in the building. Two of her best friends were among the 17 people who died, he said.
The violence must stop, he said, issuing a call to pressure lawmakers to act to make schools safer.
Kelsey Friend, a freshman at the school, appeared alongside Mr. Hogg on CNN, and grew emotional as she thanked a geography teacher who she said had saved her life.
Others, who spoke to CNN, described how a large group hid in an R.O.T.C. room where they used Kevlar blankets from a marksmanship class for protection.
