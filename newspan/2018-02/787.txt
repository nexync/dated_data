My husband has a ritual when I leave for work each day. “Have an easy commute,” he says. It’s a blessing of sorts, since the subway system can leave much to be desired.
One recent morning, he raised the ante. “Have a great commute,” he said. We laughed about what such a thing could possibly be.
Off I went downtown on the A train, which was unusually empty for rush hour. At 145th Street, a woman got on and sat down next to me. She resembled a woman I sometimes chat with via Twitter, usually about our mutual subway debacles.
Within moments, the woman next to me turned in my direction, wide-eyed and a bit spooked. Upon realizing what was happening, she burst out laughing.
“Nice to meet you!” she said.
We parted ways at 59th Street, and as a result of our serendipitous meeting, we got together for dinner the next week.
Truly, a great commute.
