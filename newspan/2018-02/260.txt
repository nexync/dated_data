At the entrance to the Armory Show, opening March 8 in New York at Piers 92 and 94, a line of silhouetted figures rising 25 feet on scaffolding will be visible from the West Side Highway. The piece, called “So Close,” is the work of the French artist JR, known for siting monumental photographic portraits in public spaces around the world to humanize political problems, and it is based on an archival image of immigrants waiting at Ellis Island. Their faces have been superimposed with recent portraits of Syrians photographed by the artist at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.
Inspired by the theme of collective assembly or force, “The Contingent” includes a new installation by Tara Donovan that groups tens of thousands of vertically stacked clear plastic tubes of different lengths in a luminous sea, rippling across the central gathering space in Pier 94. Other new works are by the Bruce High Quality Foundation, Sarah Cain, Beth Campbell, Leonardo Drew, Jeffrey Gibson, Amalia Pica, Alex Schweder and Ward Shelley, Berndnaut Smilde and Wilmer Wilson IV.
Four projects — by Elmgreen & Dragset, Richard Long, Mary Sibande and Wang Xin — will be exhibited for the first time in the United States. Ms. Sibande, an artist based in Johannesburg who has never shown in New York, will anchor Pier 92 with “Cry Havoc,” a sculpture of a woman in a regal purple dress and waving a white flag, with a pack of red dogs jumping out from around her skirts.
