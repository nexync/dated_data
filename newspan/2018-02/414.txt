SEOUL, South Korea — The American network NBC has apologized after one of its analysts drew anger for a comment during coverage of the Pyeongchang Olympics that seemed to gloss over South Korea’s painful history with Japan, its former colonial master.
The remark immediately ignited outrage in South Korea, the Olympic host nation, where resentment of Japan’s harsh early 20th-century annexation of the Korean Peninsula continues to simmer. Just last month, Mr. Abe’s attendance at the Games was in question after tensions escalated over Japan’s refusal to reissue an apology for the Japanese military’s role in forcing Korean and other women to work in military brothels during World War II.
Soon after Mr. Ramo’s remark, an online petition began to circulate demanding an apology from NBC. By Sunday, more than 8,000 people had signed it.
“We’re very gratified that POCOG has accepted that apology,” the statement added, referring to the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.
Critics also seized on other remarks made during the broadcast by Mr. Ramo, who shared in both Peabody and Emmy Awards for his work for NBC during the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing.
In addition to his role as an occasional Olympic commentator at NBC, Mr. Ramo is also co-chief executive of Kissinger Associates, an advisory firm founded by Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and sits on the board of directors for Starbucks and FedEx.
Mr. Ramo’s remarks appeared to reinforce growing concerns among some South Koreans that the United States was favoring its partnership with Japan over that of its other longtime ally in the region, South Korea.
