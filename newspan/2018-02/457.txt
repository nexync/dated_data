In 1846, Frederick Douglass most likely provoked some temperance leaders at a rally in London by declaring that slavery was an even greater evil than alcoholism. Afterward, a Brooklyn minister approached him, hand outstretched, to congratulate him. Douglass desisted.
In “Frederick Douglass in Brooklyn” (Akashic Books), Theodore Hamm, who teaches journalism at St. Joseph’s College in Brooklyn, persuasively and passionately makes the case that the borough (and former city) became a powerful forum for Douglass’s abolitionist agenda in the mid-19th century after he escaped slavery in 1838.
Mr. Hamm’s book includes eight speeches given by Douglass in Brooklyn on equality, slavery and the Civil War, most of which were presented at Plymouth Church, the Bridge Street A.M.E. Church and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Although Douglass never lived there, Brooklyn was home to leading abolitionists, black and white, including James and Elizabeth Gloucester (at whose home John Brown stopped on his way to Harpers Ferry), Lewis Tappan, Theodore Tilton (who was a 22-year-old journalist when Douglass recruited him to his newspaper, The North Star), William J. Wilson and Henry Ward Beecher (the brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”).
Douglass’s name was listed on the paper’s masthead (as it was in The National Anti-Slavery Standard published across the river in Manhattan).
But Brooklyn’s loudest voice was The Daily Eagle, a Democratic newspaper whose editorials advanced the Southern sympathies of New York’s financiers, manufacturers and maritime moguls.
In 1858, following the death of Dred Scott, namesake of the Supreme Court ruling declaring that slaves were property rather than people, The Eagle all but predicted that Douglass’s legacy would be forgotten.
