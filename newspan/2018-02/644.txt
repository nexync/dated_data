“Game Night” is, for the most part, a conventional, and conventionally vulgar, Contemporary Romantic Comedy With Lessons. Its central couple, Max and Annie, played by Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams, are avid board-game-and-trivia enthusiasts who are stuck in the fertility department. They’re having trouble conceiving because Max’s sperm are, according to his doctor, insecure. That probably has something to do with Max’s inferiority complex about his older brother Brooks (Kyle Chandler), an ostensible hotshot who decides one evening to take Max and Annie’s weekly couples game night up a notch by staging a kidnapping mystery.
Only the kidnapping is real, or seems to be. The gun Brooks leaves behind is very much real and loaded, as Max learns when one of its rounds goes through his arm. It’s at junctures like this when the movie becomes less conventional, although it never soars. The dialogue leans so heavily on pop culture references you have to wonder whether the film’s screenwriter, Mark Perez, is as insecure as his creation Max.
The directors, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who were behind the repellent 2015 film “Vacation,” show relative restraint here, in spite of a set piece that involves an adorable little dog getting its immaculate white coat doused with blood. And all the cast members — particularly the friends and neighbors played by Chelsea Peretti, Billy Magnussen, Sharon Horgan, Lamorne Morris and Jesse Plemons (who, as an uptight cop, delivers a deliberately robotic idea of a Matt Damon impersonation) — are very funny when they get the opportunity to be. And the movie is a pointed reminder that Ms. McAdams is one of cinema’s most accomplished and appealing comic actresses. It’s almost heartbreaking to contemplate how amazing she would be in a new comedy that was more than intermittently O.K.
