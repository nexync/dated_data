I applaud many of the points raised in the article. However, an important segment of online learners not mentioned are adult students looking to advance in their careers who are often juggling a full-time job and family responsibilities. A 2016 survey found that more than two-thirds of students felt time spent in online academic programs was worth it.
Pace University was an early adopter of online learning nearly 16 years ago, largely to meet the needs of students who don’t have the ability to attend classes full-time or conform to a schedule. We’ve learned that older students, often beginning studies after many years of work, need more feedback and engagement with professors and classmates.
Online programs work best when they are part of a university curriculum that is monitored by quality faculty and offers classroom and experiential learning opportunities.
While online learning might not be one-size-fits-all, I’ve seen it transform lives for the better.
