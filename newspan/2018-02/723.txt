You’ve Probably Given Up on Your Resolution. Let’s Get Back on Track.
Every Monday in this newsletter during February, Smarter Living is going to offer you tips, tricks and advice for sticking to your resolutions — or revamping them entirely into something you truly want to do. Longtime SL readers might remember this from last year, when more than 3,000 readers joined us for the month by sharing their resolutions and sending in progress updates and new strategies throughout the month.
To start, let’s go back to basics: Did you even pick the right resolution? As Jen A. Miller writes in our guide to setting and keeping resolutions, you want to pick something that your heart is in, rather than something you set arbitrarily or when emotions are high.
Specific: Set concrete, clearly defined goals with specific points of success.
Measurable: Whatever the goal is, find ways to measure progress.
Achievable: Aim high, but within reason. Your goal should be a stretch, but something you could actually achieve.
Relevant: Find a goal that matters enough to you that you’ll be motivated to stick with it.
Time-bound: Set a reasonable timeline for your goal, and focus on the small wins along the way.
Your name: I’m Tim Herrera, your Smarter Living editor.
Your resolution and why you chose it: My main resolution this year is more of a goal: I want to run the Brooklyn Half-Marathon in 90 minutes or less. It’s a stretch goal, but one within reach.
Two specific sub-goals within your resolution: 1. My training starts in earnest today, and I’m committed to running at least three days a week all month. 2. I will cross-train at least one day per week.
Next week I’ll highlight some of my favorite responses, along with some helpful tips and advice.
Have a great week, and best of luck!
