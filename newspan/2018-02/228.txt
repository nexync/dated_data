A man crashed a stolen bakery truck into a Planned Parenthood clinic in East Orange, N.J., this week, injuring a pregnant woman and two others, the authorities said.
The suspect, Marckles Alcius, 31, who had a last known address in Lowell, Mass., was charged with attempting to cause widespread injury or damage, aggravated assault, theft and other counts.
A staff member and two patients, one of whom was pregnant, were hurt in the crash on Wednesday.
“We are pleased that only minor injuries occurred,” Planned Parenthood said in a statement. The organization said there was “extensive damage to the waiting room” and the clinic would be closed for several weeks.
The stolen truck belonged to a Newark bakery, the authorities said.
Mr. Alcius pleaded not guilty in a court appearance on Friday. He is being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility in Newark, and his next court appearance is scheduled for Feb. 21.
This month, New Jersey state lawmakers voted to restore millions of dollars in funding for health and family planning clinics. The funding had been cut under the administration of Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican.
The new governor, Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, was endorsed by Planned Parenthood.
On Saturday, he wrote on Twitter that he was “angered” by the truck crash in East Orange. “At a time when women’s health care is under siege, we must protect and defend safe and affordable health care access for all,” he said.
Across the United States, health clinics that provide abortions have sometimes been targeted for protests and even attacks. But neither Planned Parenthood nor Essex County prosecutors discussed possible motives for the crash in East Orange on Valentine’s Day.
