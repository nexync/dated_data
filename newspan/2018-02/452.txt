After the production of a film ceases, its costumes are often sold for parts to rental companies. The actress Glenn Close considers this a shame. “You spend hours in the fitting room and on set living in these works of art by some of the greatest working designers,” she says. That’s why, for the past 35 years, the six-time Academy Award nominee has saved almost everything she’s performed in, from the monochromatic ensembles the costume designer Ellen Mirojnick created for 1987’s “Fatal Attraction” to the spotted fur coat she donned as the puppy-hunting Cruella de Vil in “101 Dalmatians” to her first collected piece, a simple camisole from her role in the early 1980s Broadway production of “Barnum.” This fall, Close donated her entire collection of 766 pieces to Indiana University, where the costumes will be preserved in an archival facility and “won’t be pulled apart, reconstructed or redesigned,” Close says. Her latest project, “The Wife,” a film adaptation of the Meg Wolitzer novel, will be released later this year.
