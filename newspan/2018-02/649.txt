In the wake of the suicide of a close friend — a former teacher and lifelong confidante — Nunez’s narrator wrestles with her grief and muses on both the creative life and the more banal matters that can either impede or inspire it. Then she becomes the reluctant inheritor of the friend’s very large dog, with whom she forges a new bond. Published by Riverhead Books on Feb. 6.

A young Brooklyn couple’s respite from city life — as live-in caretakers of a historic house museum upstate — turns fraught when one of them starts having trouble sleeping and then goes missing. The answer, it seems, might lie with the museum’s namesake, Edmund Wright, a 19th-century thinker with a taste for the occult. Published by Pantheon on Feb. 13.
He didn’t listen when picture books were read to him, and the sight of kids his age never made him want to talk or play with them. Pulling their hair to make them cry was all the interaction he could manage. Yet at the sight of a switch he immediately went to push it, his eyes growing brighter.
Following an unnamed catastrophe, a deeply isolationist Japan is without cars, free speech, wild animals or any number of nutrient-dense foods.

There was always at least one person in his predicament in the refuge: he would go from table to table, he would listen to the discussions for a while, joining the conversation, and would eventually propose joining the group the next morning, despite knowing that nobody was keen to tie a stranger to his rope.
For Pietro’s parents, and his moody father, in particular, mountains offer the chance to feel free and fully alive.

He was only a human — what else could I expect, realistically? He wanted to pretend he was somehow better than he knew he was; he wasn’t ready to throw himself into sin. Humans find it easier to just lie and lie to themselves.

There’s something of the godly about this troubled Nigerian girl, who grows up and moves to the States for college, where the voices within her grow ever louder.
