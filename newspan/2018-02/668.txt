LONDON — A British judge upheld the arrest warrant for the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on Tuesday, assuring that he would remain ensconced in the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he has been for the past five and a half years.
After the ruling, one of Mr. Assange’s lawyers, Mark Summers, asked whether it was in the public interest to keep pursuing his client for breach of bail.
Judge Arbuthnot said she would rule on Feb. 13 on a new bid to have the arrest warrant against Mr. Assange dropped on the grounds of public interest.
Here are key points in his case since WikiLeaks burst onto the scene in 2010.
Even if the warrant had been dropped, it was never assured that Mr. Assange would have left the embassy, although Ecuador recently granted him citizenship. Still hanging over him is the possibility of a secret extradition request from the United States, where he faces prosecution for leaking documents that United States officials have deemed damaging to national security.
WikiLeaks has published thousands of classified military documents and diplomatic cables from the American government. Once a darling of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, Mr. Assange became persona non grata after WikiLeaks published emails that Russia had hacked from the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.
Mr. Assange, 46, has been living in the Ecuadorean Embassy since 2012, after Swedish prosecutors sought his arrest over allegations of sexual assault and rape.
Sweden has since dropped the investigation, but Mr. Assange chose to remain in the embassy out of fear that of being arrested for breaching bail conditions in Britain and of being extradited to the United States.
Last month, the Foreign Office in London refused to grant Mr. Assange diplomatic immunity, which would have given him certain protections and might have allowed him to leave the embassy without facing arrest, including over a United States extradition request.
