Like George, the silverback gorilla his primatologist character befriends in the new movie “Rampage,” Dwayne Johnson just keeps getting bigger.
His family comedy “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” released in December, is still doing major box-office business, and the Super Bowl Sunday trailer for his summer action flick, “Skyscraper,” has earned high marks. But before that release, there’s “Rampage,” based on a popular video game.
The latest trailer features new footage of George as well as other creatures that swell to Godzilla-like proportions and wreak havoc. It also includes Mr. Johnson’s trademark sly, raised-eyebrow humor: “Of course, the wolf flies,” he deadpans of one monster.
“Let’s go save the world,” Mr. Johnson’s gorilla whisperer declares. It’s a safe bet that Mr. Johnson will succeed — and save the worldwide box office again when “Rampage” invades theaters on April 20.
