Graydon Carter and Jeff Klein, the owners of the Monkey Bar in Midtown Manhattan since 2009, have installed David Tanis as the new chef at the venerable restaurant and watering hole.
Mr. Tanis, who was the head chef at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., for many years and was also the chef at Cafe Escalera in Santa Fe, N.M., is a frequent contributor to The New York Times, where he writes the “City Kitchen” column for the Food section. He is also the author of four cookbooks.
Mr. Klein said they expected refinement and subtle changes at the Monkey Bar with Mr. Tanis in charge. The restaurant now has a rather conventional menu featuring staples like shrimp cocktail, steak tartare, wedge salad, rack of lamb and a burger.
Mr. Tanis said his food “will be straightforward and simply presented.” He added that the menu would evolve, but would veer away from steakhouse fare and emphasize more salads, fish and vegetables with a seasonal focus using sustainable ingredients.
Mr. Tanis’s chef de cuisine is Mason Lindahl.
