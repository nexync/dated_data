When I am walking in Manhattan, I will occasionally compliment a dog owner on the pet that he or she is walking. Without fail, this seems to please the owner and elicit a smile and a thank you.
While walking south along Central Park West on a recent day, I noticed a sleek, handsome Great Dane coming my way. It was on a leash. I didn’t make eye contact with the owner.
“Gorgeous,” I said as we passed each other.
