Like those efforts, our successful park creation projects in Chile show the possibilities of public-private collaboration fueled by entrepreneurial philanthropy. Anyone can conceive of big ideas, but to carve them into being requires political leaders with the courage to protect important landscapes. In Chile, President Bachelet and her administration possess this bravery and determination.
Her leadership was crucial. She saw the economic potential for jobs and revenue from ecotourism and also understood the importance of protecting her country’s wild heritage for future generations. These parks will be part of a planned network of 17 parks along more than 1,500 miles from Puerto Montt to Cape Horn.
The new national parks established this week include our two signature projects: Pumalín, which lies south of Puerto Mont in the lakes district, comprises roughly one million acres of temperate rain forest, including some of the planet’s last stands of towering Alerce trees, cousins of the coast redwoods of California. In the 764,000-acre Patagonia National Park, the arid Patagonia steppe meets wetter forests, making for a rich diversity of wildlife habitats. As President Bachelet signed the decree creating these parks, a herd of guanacos grazed in the waving grasses and a black-chested buzzard-eagle soared overhead.
There is a central truth to humanity’s relationship with nature: We were born into it, fully dependent on it from our first breath. Two hundred years from now let the elephants trumpet, the giant sequoias sway in stiff winds and our descendants enjoy healthy lives aware of their place in this wild thing we call nature.
