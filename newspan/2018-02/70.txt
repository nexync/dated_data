No matter how much Americans may value marriage, we now spend more time living single than ever before. In 1960, Americans were married for an average of 29 of the 37 years between the ages of 18 and 55. Thatâ€™s almost 80 percent of what was then regarded as the prime of life. By 2015, the average had dropped to only 18 years.
