The Pulitzer Amsterdam celebrates its past but has a flair for modern touches. Don’t miss the bar — or the boat tour.
Jansz is an airy, elegant restaurant. The menu is eclectic and combines specialties from countries across Europe. For an extra charge (29.50 euros per person), hotel guests can have breakfast here. You get to choose a hot dish off the menu as well as help yourself to a buffet of fruits, cheeses and danishes. The soft music in the background and the abundance of light made it a cheerful and relaxing place to start the day. For dinner I sat at the hotel’s bar, The Pulitzer, which looks like it belongs in the 1930s with wood paneling, deep couches and tables tucked in secret corners. The attentive bartender made me a pineapple old-fashioned, a signature drink, and recommended snacks to order. I was surprised by how friendly the place was; I chatted with locals and other travelers and stayed out longer than I had anticipated.
