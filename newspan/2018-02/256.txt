This is Mr. Horowitz’s second venture, authorized by the Fleming estate, into 007 terrain; his first Bond novel, “Trigger Mortis,” was published by Jonathan Cape (Fleming’s original publishers) in 2015 to approving reviews. Both books make use of treatments that Fleming wrote for an American television series that was never made. In an interview with The New York Times in 2015, Mr. Horowitz said that it was inspiring and exciting to have access to writings by Fleming that almost no one had seen. “James Bond is one of those things identified with this country,” he said.
