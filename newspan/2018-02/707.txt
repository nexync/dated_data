Closing underperforming public schools is not a panacea, but it offers disaffected parents of all races an opportunity — not a guarantee — of a better education for their children. Loyalty to neighborhood schools will always take a back seat to the needs of their own children. That’s why long wait lists exist in all large cities.
Whatever disruption is created by the closings can be ameliorated by a controlled phaseout process and increased support to help the affected make a smoother transition to other schools that provide a quality education.
