Hometown The Viejas Indian Reservation.
Now Lives In a four-bedroom apartment in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn that he shares with three roommates.
Claim to Fame In 2016, Tommy Pico released his first novel, “IRL,” an epic poem in the form of an extended text message that was awarded the Brooklyn Public Library Literary Prize. Inspired by A. R. Ammons’s “Tape for the Turn of the Year” and Beyoncé’s self-titled album, the 98-page book was written over the course of three and a half months in 2014, and encompasses topics as broad as the oppression of Native Americans, pop culture and the dating rituals of gay men. ”I found a way to not only sew those ideas together but also show that they were never separate in the first place,” Mr. Pico said.
Latest Project In 2017, Mr. Pico started Food 4 Thot, a boisterous, intellectual and sometimes profane round-table podcast with three other gay writers: Fran Tirado, Joseph Osmundson and Dennis Norris II. The episodes, which often tackle sex, race and relationships, are now streaming on Grindr.
Next Project Mr. Pico’s third novel, “Junk,” is scheduled for release in May, followed by his fourth book, “Food.” He also finished a screenplay for Cinereach, a nonprofit film foundation in New York.
