Some, like Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, extol the virtues of layered defense systems, similar to those employed at military checkpoints. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos called for teachers to have the “opportunity and option” to carry weapons in school. President Trump proposed Thursday that trained teachers should be offered a bonus for carrying a concealed weapon at school. Others suggest putting combat veterans in classrooms.
