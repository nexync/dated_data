An aide to State Representative Shawn Harrison of Florida was fired on Tuesday after claiming falsely that two students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were “actors that travel to various crisis when they happen,” a common far-right conspiracy theory after mass shootings.
Mr. Harrison’s district secretary, Benjamin Kelly, made the assertion in an email sent from his state account to a Tampa Bay Times reporter, Alex Leary. Mr. Leary, who posted a screen shot of the email on Twitter, had written about far-right attacks on the students fighting for new gun laws in response to the shooting at their school last week, which killed 17 people.
Mr. Kelly’s email referred to Emma González, 18, and David Hogg, 17, two seniors who have been outspoken in the days since the shooting. The Broward County superintendent, Robert W. Runcie, confirmed to The Tampa Bay Times that they were Stoneman Douglas students.
“I am appalled at and strongly denounce his comments about the Parkland students,” Mr. Harrison, a Republican representing a district north of Tampa, tweeted, adding that Mr. Kelly had made his remarks “without my knowledge.” Mr. Harrison did not immediately respond to a voice mail message at his Tallahassee office, and the voice mail at his district office was full.
Mr. Kelly did not respond to a Twitter message asking whether he stood by his claim that the students were actors, and whether his “error in judgment” was in believing that or simply in sharing the belief with a reporter. By 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday, he had made all his tweets private.
Earlier in the day, as students boarded a bus to lobby state lawmakers in Tallahassee, Cameron Kasky, a 17-year-old junior at Stoneman Douglas, urged his classmates not to let conspiracy theories distract them.
