The photo array that Detective Foder claimed to have shown to the victim in November had photographs with December dates. Most of the photos from the February lineup had March dates.
An indictment unsealed on Tuesday charges Detective Foder with perjury and obstruction of an official proceeding.
“Our justice system relies upon the absolute integrity of our law enforcement officers and, while the vast majority of officers uphold that standard, we will not hesitate to act when one does not,” Richard P. Donoghue, the United States attorney in Brooklyn, said in a statement.
The indictment accuses Detective Foder of having “falsified documentation relating to the purported identifications made by the victim” in the carjacking case.
At an arraignment on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, a lawyer for Detective Foder entered a not-guilty plea on the detective’s behalf. Detective Foder was released on bail.
“I don’t think there is any indication he wasn’t acting in good faith investigating the case,” Mr. Moschella told reporters after the court hearing. Mr. Moshella said he expects Detective Foder to be suspended from the Police Department for 30 days, and return to work in some capacity while the case is pending.
The carjacking charges involving Mr. Polat’s vehicle were dropped against the two men who had been arrested on the basis of the photo lineups — Mardoche Petitphare and Rayvaughn Williams — when they pleaded guilty to an unrelated crime: the attempted robbery of a fast-food restaurant.
