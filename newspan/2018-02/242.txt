WASHINGTON — K. T. McFarland, who was a deputy national security adviser in the Trump administration and then was picked to serve as ambassador to Singapore, withdrew her ambassadorial nomination on Friday after it had stalled in the Senate.
Ms. McFarland’s nomination had become embroiled in the controversy over the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russian officials, with some senators left wondering if she had answered questions deceptively when asked if she knew of discussions between Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, and a Russian ambassador.
Senate Republicans could have approved her nomination unilaterally, but the fact that it was never brought to a vote suggested that she had made even some of them uneasy.
Ms. McFarland was a member of the Trump transition team and then became Mr. Flynn’s deputy on the National Security Council, where she ruffled feathers with her intense partisanship.
Mr. Flynn’s successor, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, pushed Ms. McFarland out in an effort to return the council to a traditional professional operation. Her nomination as ambassador to Singapore was seen as an effort to reward her loyalty.
But in July, she was questioned in writing by Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, on whether she had ever spoken with Mr. Flynn, before Mr. Trump took office, about Mr. Flynn’s contacts with Sergey I. Kislyak, who was then the Russian ambassador to Washington.
When an email later surfaced showing that Ms. McFarland had been aware of a crucial Dec. 29, 2016, phone call between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak, questions were raised about her honesty.
Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty last year to lying to F.B.I. agents about his interactions with Mr. Kislyak.
