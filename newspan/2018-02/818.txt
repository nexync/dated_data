Belgian milk producers demonstrated on the main square of the city of Charleroi during a strike called by French dairy unions to force European authorities to take more action to counter a slump in the industry.
Dairy farmers have blocked deliveries, held back supply and thrown away millions of liters of their produce as part of a campaign over what they argue is a failed liberalization and milk quota system.
They blame both the European Commission and local governments and about 7,000 liters of milk was dumped in front of German agriculture ministry buildings in Bonn on Saturday.
After a price spike in 2007, global dairy markets have declined with European producer prices falling to lows of about 20 (euro) cents per liter. Most farmers say about 40 cents per liter is needed to cover costs and generate a basic revenue.
Leaders of the protests say they want the European Union to freeze planned increases in production quotas and on Wednesday they demanded the creation of a pan-European institution to regulate the demand and supply of milk.
“It is really sad that we have to throw away the milk,” Romuald Schaber, president of the European Milk Board, said at a demonstration in Belgium where protesting farmers watched hundreds of tractors spew milk over fields.
