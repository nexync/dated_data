More than 30 years after it closed on Broadway, “Torch Song” will return this fall to the theater where it made its big-stage debut.
The show’s lead producer, Richie Jackson, announced Tuesday that a two-act version of Harvey Fierstein’s “Torch Song,” his play about the life of Arnold Beckoff, a gay, Jewish drag performer and singer, will open at the Helen Hayes Theater on Nov. 1 after a successful run Off Broadway for the Second Stage Theater.
The Second Stage revival of “Torch Song,” directed by Moisés Kaufman, opened in October at the Tony Kiser Theater with Michael Urie and Mercedes Ruehl in the starring roles as Arnold and his overbearing mother. In his Times review, Ben Brantley said that Mr. Urie and Ms. Ruehl were “two ideally matched performers, at the top of their games,” and he named the show a Critic’s Pick.
The original Broadway production of the three-part, four-hour “Torch Song” opened in 1982 at the Little Theater, now called the Helen Hayes, with Mr. Fierstein playing Arnold. The following year he won two Tony Awards, for best play and best actor in a play.
The Helen Hayes is set to reopen on March 1 after a renovation.
Tickets for “Torch Song” will go on sale to the public on March 9 at 10 a.m.
