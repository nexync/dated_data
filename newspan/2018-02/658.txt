The simple plan for the N.R.A's servants to follow if they want to avoid doing anything about gun violence.
There’s a time and place for a political debate. But now is the time to unite as a country. I don’t want to get into that debate right now. There will be an absolute appropriate time for us to talk about policies and politics. I’m sure that folks will want to score political points off this tragedy. But I think we need to wait. Before we begin to advocate for new laws, I think it is eminently fair to say, how are we doing enforcing the ones we currently have. Had the Obama administration simply followed federal law, and enforced the law existing gun laws made it illegal for the Sutherland Springs shooter to buy a gun. And all you hear now is let’s have new laws, new laws, when we don’t enforce the laws we have. We will lift the victims and their families and the entire community in prayer. Scripture says ... They’re just sick people. They are mentally imbalanced. How do we make sure that individuals with mental illness do not touch a gun. Often underneath this is a diagnosis of mental illness. We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools and tackle the difficult issue of mental health.
