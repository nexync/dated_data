SPECIAL POST — Lots of complaints about the answer LENE (16-Across — “Voiceless consonant like “b” or “p”) in today’s crossword.
Because I figured few solvers today know what LENE means (the last dictionary it seems to have appeared in is Webster’s Second New International in 1934, where it was already labeled “rare”), I decided to spell it out with examples. Unfortunately, the example “b” is wrong. That is a voiced consonant, not a voiceless one.
In retrospect, as the commenter Byron suggested at Crosswordfiend.com, I should have left the semi-duplication FAR CRY/CRIERS as it was. That would have been preferable to the obscure and ugly LENE.
The online version of the puzzle has now been restored to CRIERS/CLAY/RENE, which all future solvers will see. Of course, nothing can be done now about the print version of the puzzle. A correction on the clue error should appear shortly.
