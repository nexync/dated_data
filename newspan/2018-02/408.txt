On this week’s podcast, Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon read “Overfed on a Mother’s Affection,” about a son who is sick and tired of taking home Tupperware containers.
This week, Kumail Nanjiani and Emily Gordon tell the story of a parent who shows her love through leftovers.
Mr. Nanjiani and Ms. Gordon turned their love story into a big-screen dramedy last year. Now, “The Big Sick” is up for an Oscar for best original screenplay.
