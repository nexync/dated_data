Roger Rosenblatt graces this week’s cover with a review of “Time Pieces: A Dublin Memoir,” by John Banville. In a 2004 essay, Banville reflected on his youthful encounters with Dublin and James Joyce’s “Ulysses.” Read an excerpt below.
Very many years ago, when I was growing up in the town of Wexford, on the southeast coast of Ireland, I dearly wished to get hold of a copy of James Joyce’s “Ulysses.” I had read “Dubliners” and “A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,” and had even written, on a big black Remington borrowed from my Aunt Sadie, a number of lugubrious short stories in what I thought was the Joycean manner, mainly devoted to the subject of death and all centered on a neurasthenic young hero whom no one truly understood, whose soul was much given to swooning and who went under different names but was always me.
Dublin, even well into the 1960’s, when I came to live there, was in many respects still the city that Joyce had known and that he celebrated with maniacal exactitude in “Ulysses.” All now is changed. True, most of the streets and many of the buildings through which Joyce’s characters circulate on their way to eternity are still in existence, but the heart of the place is a transplant from Silicon Valley by way of the poppy fields of Afghanistan: Ireland is the world’s largest exporter of computer software, and its capital city is a serious importer of the hardest of hard drugs. Where now is the “real” Dublin?
