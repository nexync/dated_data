A chorus of Democratic lawmakers have joined the education secretary, Betsy DeVos, in calling for Congress to act after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla.
In a letter on Friday, all 17 Democrats on the House Education Committee urged Representative Virginia Foxx, the committee’s chairwoman, to convene hearings on school shootings, describing them as a “public health epidemic.” The panel has not addressed the issue since February 2013 — two months after a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut left 20 first graders and six adults dead, they said.
The letter adds pressure on Congress to address the pervasiveness of school shootings across the country, an issue that Ms. DeVos raised during an interview on Thursday with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.
Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Senate Education Committee, said she “wholeheartedly” agreed with the suggestion and invited Ms. DeVos to testify.
“Families across the country are tired of waiting for Congress to step up, have the tough conversations, and adopt common sense gun safety and other policies to end this scourge in our schools and communities,” Ms. Murray said in a statement.
The Education Department has not indicated whether Ms. DeVos would visit Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
In April, she made an unannounced visit to San Bernardino, Calif., shortly after a shooting at North Park Elementary School left one student injured and another student and special education teacher dead.
That same day, Mr. Trump delivered an address at the annual convention for the National Rifle Association, which provided at least $30 million in support during his presidential campaign.
