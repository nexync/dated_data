With the Super Bowl three days away, a new documentary delves into Bill Belichick’s relationship with his mentor, Bill Parcells. And the “Ocean’s” trilogy arrives on Netflix.
30 FOR 30: THE TWO BILLS 9 p.m. on ESPN. It’s hard to imagine Bill Belichick coaching any team other than the New England Patriots, especially as he leads them to their eighth Super Bowl together on Sunday. But Mr. Belichick won two championships as defensive coordinator with the New York Giants under the tutelage of the head coach Bill Parcells. The two had a lasting partnership across three franchises, until Mr. Belichick betrayed his mentor to take the Patriots job in 2000. This documentary puts them back in the same room and pulls from an almost three-hour conversation, as the two fierce competitors reflect on their tumultuous decades-long relationship.
MYSTERIES AT THE MUSEUM 9 p.m. on the Travel Channel. Don Wildman hosts this series, which uses artifacts as a jumping-off point to investigate historical events. This episode focuses on the mob in America and visits Al Capone’s jail cell in Philadelphia.

OCEAN’S TRILOGY on Netflix. Steven Soderbergh shot his forthcoming movie, “Unsane,” on an iPhone. His “Ocean’s” trilogy is decidedly higher-budget, with its casino set pieces, glimmering diamonds and, of course, names like Clooney, Pitt, Damon and Zeta-Jones. Each film builds toward one giant, improbable heist; the details aren’t so important, but the actors, who also include Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Andy Garcia and Julia Roberts, make for good company along the way as they showboat, shimmy, roll dice and don prosthetics. All three films appear on Netflix on Thursday, with the first one (“Ocean’s Eleven”) receiving the strongest reviews.
