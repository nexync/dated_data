After reading this poem, I found myself pondering the meaning of feminism. There are allusions to Mother Nature, motherhood and womanhood throughout. “See, I am my own whore” is downright radical, wondrous. The eyes should roll when a guy starts talking about feminism, and I’m not saying anything here is correct, exactly. Only that this mighty poem inspires contemplation and conversation. It speaks for itself.
