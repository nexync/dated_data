This is Tyler George, a 35-year-old curler from Duluth, Minn. He is competing with the United States men’s team at the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.
These are the shoes he wears when he is competing: 8-year-old Skechers with more holes than a spaghetti strainer.
After we wrote about his shoes last week, we reached out on Twitter to offer some assistance: Perhaps it was time for George to find a new pair of “heroes,” as he calls his battle-worn kicks.
George was up for the challenge. He recruited a teammate, Joe Polo, to join us on a recent afternoon as we hit a busy shopping center in downtown Gangneung, where the curling events are.
At our first stop, George liked the selection.
So we wandered around. We thought about stopping for ice cream.
And playing games at an arcade.
And watching figure skating at an outdoor plaza.
We tried some new street food. “Is this intestine?” George asked. It was not his favorite meal ever.
So we went for pizza instead.
Back on the hunt for sneakers, George considered a pair that would honor the host country. But he eventually found himself back in more familiar territory. He saw a pair he liked.
He tried them on.
“How comfy is that?” he asked. He was less certain that they would make for practical curling shoes — the soles were not quite right.
But he wanted them anyway.
Success! Best of luck with your new heroes, Tyler.
